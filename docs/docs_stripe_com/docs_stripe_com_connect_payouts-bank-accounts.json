Stripe recommends collecting external account details with the Connect\nOnboarding web form, which helps you:\n\n- Save design and development time.\n- Eliminate the need to store sensitive data such as account and routing numbers\non your server.\n- Eliminate the need to build form validations when users enter account details.\n\nIn the US, we also recommend using [Stripe Financial\nConnections](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections), which lets your\nusers securely link their financial accounts to your business. It helps you:\n\n- Increase onboarding conversion by preventing your accounts from having to\ninterrupt the process to locate their account and routing numbers.\n- Reduce first payout failure rates by eliminating errors that result from\nmanual entry of account and routing numbers.\n- Eliminate the need to store sensitive data such as account and routing numbers\non your server.\n- Eliminate the need to build form validations when accounts enter account\ndetails in custom onboarding forms.\n- Enable your accounts to authenticate in fewer steps by reusing bank account\ndetails they’ve saved to\n[Link](https://support.stripe.com/questions/link-for-financial-connections-support-for-businesses).\nAccounts that save their account information at any of the Stripe businesses\nusing Link can share their account details with your platform the next time they\nuse Financial Connections.\n- Access additional information on an account’s external bank account, such as\n[balances](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/balances), [ownership\ndetails](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/ownership), and\n[transactions](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/transactions). You\ncan mitigate fraud during onboarding by verifying that information, such as the\nname and address of the external bank account holder.\n\nFinancial Connections is free when you include Link. Otherwise, using it [incurs\nfees](https://stripe.com/financial-connections#pricing).\n\nAlternatively, if you use API onboarding for your connected accounts, you can\ncollect payout account details with a custom form in your account onboarding\nflow.\n\n### Opting out of external account collection\n\nFor accounts where the platform is responsible for collecting requirements, such\nas Custom accounts, you may opt not to collect external account information in\nonboarding. You may do this if, for instance, you build your own onboarding flow\nwhere you want to collect external account information.\n\nIn embedded onboarding, you can [disable external account\ncollection](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/supported-embedded-components/account-onboarding?#external-account-collection)\nby setting the `external_account_collection` feature on the Account Session to\nfalse. Alternatively, in hosted onboarding you can navigate to your [Connect\nexternal accounts\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/payouts/external_accounts)\nand then under **Accounts where the platform is responsible for collecting\nrequirements** enable or disable collecting external account information. Note\nthat this is off by default.\n\n## Collecting external accounts\n\nStripe-hosted onboardingDirect API calls from a custom form\n[Stripe-hosted onboarding for connected\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding) uses a web\nform hosted by Stripe to collect the information required to onboard connected\naccounts. Stripe-hosted onboarding can collect both bank accounts and debit\ncards. You can use Financial Connections with Stripe-hosted onboarding to\ncollect bank account details. However, you can’t use Financial Connections to\ncollect debit card details.\n\nIf you’re responsible for connected accounts that can’t cover negative balances,\nincluding Custom and Express accounts, you can customize the collection flow of\nexternal accounts in your [External\naccount](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/payouts/external_accounts)\nsettings. These settings aren’t applicable if you’re using direct API calls from\nyour own form.\n\nIn your **External account** settings, you can:\n\n- Enable or disable the collection of debit cards, by making a selection under\n**Allow debit cards?**.\n- Require that connected accounts must add at least one bank account before\nbeing able to add any other type of external account, such as a debit card. You\ncan access this setting under **Require at least one bank account?**. This is\nuseful for ensuring [auto\ndebit](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-balances#automatically-debit-connected-accounts)\nsupport.\n- Control whether or not connected accounts to add more than one external\naccount in a given currency. There is a limit of five external accounts per\ncurrency. You can access this setting under **Collect multiple external accounts\nper currency**.\nUse Stripe Financial ConnectionsEnable manual entry of bank account details\n## Available in\n\nUnited States\nStripe platforms in the US can enable [Stripe Financial\nConnections](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections) within the\nStripe-hosted onboarding form by following these steps:\n\n- Navigate to your [External Account\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/payouts/external_accounts),\nwhere you manage optional Connect onboarding features.\n- For connected accounts where your platform collects account information when\nrequirements change, including for Custom accounts, you must allow Stripe-hosted\nonboarding to collect external account details. Under **Stripe-hosted onboarding\nfor Custom accounts**, allow Stripe to collect external account information by\nturning on the toggle.\n- Under **How will bank account details be collected?**, select **Financial\nConnections**.\n- *(Optional)* Request permission to access additional data on the accounts\ninstantly verified with Financial Connections, such as balances, ownership\ndetails, and transactions. If you opt to request this additional information,\nyou’ll be prompted to sign up for Stripe Financial Connections.\n\nWhen external account detail collection is enabled, all connected accounts are\nprompted to authenticate their bank account using the Stripe-hosted modal UI\nembedded within the onboarding form.\n\n![Image showing a Connect onboarding flow using Stripe Financial Connections to\ncollect a payout\naccount.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/connect-custom-onboarding-financial-connections-onboarding.8937a023f6682c90bab8c0b39873909a.png)\n\nA Connect onboarding flow using Stripe Financial Connections to collect a payout\naccount.\n\nIf a connected account can’t instantly verify their bank account using Financial\nConnections, the verification process automatically falls back to manual entry:\n\n![Image showing a Connect onboarding flow using the Stripe Financial Connections\nmodal to collect a payout account using manual\nentry.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/connect-custom-onboarding-financial-connections-manual-entry.930da1e01c9026b9014008d75958bc8c.png)\n\nA Connect onboarding flow using the Stripe Financial Connections modal to\ncollect a payout account using manual entry.\n\nAfter onboarding, the specified bank account automatically attaches to the\nconnected account.\n\n## Retrieve data on a Financial Connections account Server-side\n\nYou can determine if your user linked a Financial Connections Account by\nretrieving any linked Financial Connections Accounts using their connected\naccount ID. Be sure to specify their account ID in the `Stripe-Account` header.\n\n```\ncurl -G https://api.stripe.com/v1/financial_connections/accounts \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -H \"Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}\" \\\n -d \"account_holder[account]\"={{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}\n```\n\nThis returns an API response similar to the following:\n\n```\n{\n \"object\": \"list\",\n \"data\": [\n {\n \"id\": \"fca_zbyrdjTrwcYZJZc6WBs6GPid\",\n \"object\": \"financial_connections.account\",\n \"account_holder\": {\n \"account\": '{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}',\n \"type\": \"account\"\n },\n ...\n \"supported_payment_method_types\": [\n \"us_bank_account\"\n ]\n }\n ...\n ]\n}\n```\n\nIf any Financial Connections accounts are listed, it indicates that the\nconnected account linked them during the onboarding process. You can use the\n`id` value to access or refresh the data you specified in your [External Account\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/payouts/external_accounts).\nTo protect the privacy of your connected account’s data, you can only access the\ndata you specified.\n\nTo start retrieving account data, follow the guides for\n[balances](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/balances),\n[ownership](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/ownership), and\n[transactions](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/transactions). On\nall subsequent account retrieval and refresh requests, be sure to include the\n`Stripe-Account` header with the connected account ID:\n\n```\ncurl\nhttps://api.stripe.com/v1/financial_connections/accounts/fca_zbyrdjTrwcYZJZc6WBs6GPid/refresh\n\\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -H \"Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}\" \\\n -d \"features[]\"=balance\n```\n\n## Links\n\n- [configured with\nproperties](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/update-to-typeless-connect)\n- [Payout](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts)\n- [Stripe Financial Connections](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections)\n-\n[Link](https://support.stripe.com/questions/link-for-financial-connections-support-for-businesses)\n- [balances](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/balances)\n- [ownership details](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/ownership)\n- [transactions](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/transactions)\n- [incurs fees](https://stripe.com/financial-connections#pricing)\n- [disable external account\ncollection](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/supported-embedded-components/account-onboarding?#external-account-collection)\n- [Connect external accounts\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/payouts/external_accounts)\n- [Stripe-hosted onboarding for connected\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding)\n- [auto\ndebit](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-balances#automatically-debit-connected-accounts)",
