# Monitor your deployment

## Monitor your Android apps on Stripe SmartPOS Android devices.

After you deploy your app, you can monitor its deployment progress using the
Stripe Dashboard. This allows you to investigate any issues during deployment
and to deploy a new app, if needed.

Follow these steps to monitor your app:

- In the Stripe Dashboard, click **Developers** > **Apps**.
- On the [Terminal
apps](https://dashboard.stripe.com/terminal/apps_on_devices/apps) tab, choose
the app that you want to monitor.
- On the app details page, under **App info**, choose the release version to
view the deployment status and number of Stripe readers in that status.
