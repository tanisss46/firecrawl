# Enable subscriptions for Adobe Commerce products

## Configure the Stripe Connector for Adobe Commerce to enable subscriptions for any Adobe Commerce product.

You can turn any
[virtual](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-admin/catalog/products/types/product-create-virtual.html?lang=en)
or
[simple](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-admin/catalog/products/types/product-create-simple.html?lang=en)
Adobe Commerce product into a subscription product from its configuration page
in your admin panel. When a customer buys a subscription product, the module
registers a recurring payment against that order using [Stripe
Billing](https://stripe.com/billing). Stripe manages this subscription,
attempting payment collection on a recurring basis based on the subscription
settings in Adobe Commerce. Stripe can also notify the customer if the payment
fails and ask them to update their billing details. You can control this in your
[Subscriptions and emails
settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/automatic).

On payment success, your website receives a
[webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/adobe-commerce/payments/configuration#webhooks)
notification from Stripe. The module automatically creates a new order in your
Adobe Commerce admin panel for each renewal. These recurring orders don’t
include the initial subscription fees, and the module recalculates the shipping
and tax amounts for each individual recurring subscription product.

## How to enable and configure subscriptions

You can enable
[subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating) for any
Adobe Commerce product from the product configuration page. When creating or
editing a product, scroll down until you see the **Stripe Subscriptions**
section:

!

Configuration options for subscriptions

Here, you have the following options:

- **Subscription Enabled:** Turn this on to convert this product into a
subscription and automatically create a subscription plan when customers check
out with this product. You don’t need to create a subscription plan in your
Stripe account. A subscription plan is automatically created for this product
when your customers check out.
- **Frequency:** Select **Days**, **Weeks**, **Months**, or **Years**. The
customer sees whatever you select here for the frequency. If you prefer to
display **30 Days** instead of **1 Month**, set this to **Days** instead. If you
select **Days**, the subscription cycle in your Stripe account reflects this.
- **Repeat Every:** Set the length of the billing cycle based on the specified
frequency. For example, a value of 30 here with frequency of **Days** bills
every 30 days.
- **Trial Days:** Enter the number of days before the first charge for the
subscription (that is, the number of free days).
- **Initial Fee:** Enter an amount to charge in addition to the subscription
price.
- **Start on specific date:** Enable to expose custom start date specification
options. When customers purchase the subscription, it begins on the specified
date instead of starting immediately.
- **Pick start date:** Specify the start date for the subscription. The format
is a specific date, but the start date forwards to the next applicable billing
cycle after the start date has passed. For example, if the start date is
`01/01/2024`, a monthly subscription always starts on the 1st of the month,
while a 6-month subscription always starts on either January 1st or July 1st.
- **First payment:** Specify how to collect the first payment when you enable a
start date:- Collect it on the specified start date.
- Collect the first payment when the order is placed, and all subsequent
payments on the specified start date. This option is useful for physical product
subscriptions that ship the first product immediately when ordered, with
subsequent shipments conforming to the start date of the billing cycle.
- **Prorate first payment:** Setting an immediate first payment exposes this
field. Enable this setting to account for the number of days from the date of
the order placement to the subscription start date so the first payment reflects
the shortened cycle before the full subscription begins.
- **Customers can change subscription:** Enable to allow customers to edit their
subscription from the customer account section. They can change the quantity,
customizable options, configurable options or bundle options of each order item.
These are additional edit options to the shipping address, shipping method or
payment method, which customers can always change at any time.
- **Prorate upgrades:** Enable to apply a fee to account for any price
difference when a customer upgrades their subscription between billing cycles.
Disable to defer the new subscription price until the next billing cycle.
- **Prorate downgrades:** Enable to credit the customer’s account balance when
they downgrade their subscription mid-cycle and apply the credit to future
subscription payments. Disable to apply the lower price to the next billing
cycle.

## Configurable subscriptions

You can use Magento [configurable
products](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-admin/catalog/products/types/product-create-configurable.html?lang=en)
to offer multiple options to your customers for a single product. Customers can
choose their preferred option using either a drop-down, a visual swatch, or a
text swatch. Each option can be a simple or virtual product and that product can
itself be a subscription.

!

Configurable subscription

- Go to **Stores** > **Attributes** > **Product**.
- Create an
[attribute](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-admin/catalog/products/types/product-create-configurable.html?lang=en#step-1%3A-choose-the-attributes)
and choose your preferred input type and labels.
- Make sure to set the attribute to be on the **Global** scope.
- Go to **Stores** > **Attributes** > **Attribute Set** and add the attribute to
an attribute set.
- Add the attribute set to your single products.
- You can now create a configurable product using the single products updated
above.

## Bundled subscriptions

Adobe Commerce allows you to [bundle
products](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-admin/catalog/products/types/product-create-bundle.html?lang=en)
when you want to sell multiple products together. This prevents customers from
removing an individual product from the cart before checkout.

When a bundle product includes at least one subscription, Stripe treats the
price of the entire bundle as the subscription price. For recurring payments,
Stripe collects both the amount of the entire bundle item and the individual
subscription item of the bundle.

After payment collection, Adobe Commerce automatically creates a recurring order
that includes the entire bundle item (the subscription items and regular items
from the original order). Inventory is then processed for the subscription and
the other products in the bundle. This contrasts with carts that include
subscriptions and regular products separately. In that case, recurring orders
only include the subscription product.

If you want to combine a subscription product with a regular product and only
bill the subscription product in the next cycle, you can use [grouped
products](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-admin/catalog/products/types/product-create-grouped.html?lang=en).
Alternatively, you can configure an initial fee for the subscription when
there’s no inventory to process.

## Switch subscription plans

Customers can change the following from their account:

- Configurable, bundled, simple, and virtual subscriptions
- Customizable or configurable options
- Quantities
- Bundle options
- Shipping address or method
- Payment method

Customers can also switch between two or more plans as long as they belong to
the same [configurable
product](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/adobe-commerce/payments/subscriptions#configurable-subscriptions).

- The customer logs into their account and goes to **My subscriptions**.
- They select the subscription they want to change and click **Change
subscription**.
- The customer is redirected to the subscription product page, where they can
change their plan, quantities, or other product options.
- When they click **Update cart**, they’re automatically redirected to the
checkout page, where they can review the old and new subscription prices.
- The customer clicks **Update subscription**, which immediately updates the
subscription price or plan. The customer is then redirected to **My
subscriptions** in their account.

You can enable or disable subscription changes for each subscription product
separately or you can use the global setting under **Stores** >
**Configuration** > **Sales** > **Payment Methods** > **Stripe** >
**Subscriptions**.

## Prorations for virtual subscriptions

The module supports
[prorations](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/prorations) for
virtual subscriptions. You can enable prorations for upgrades or downgrades
separately.

!

Configurable subscription

The module compares what both the current and new plan cost for a 30-day period
to determine whether or not it’s an upgrade or downgrade. If the cost of the new
plan is lower, we consider it a downgrade. If the price remains the same or if
it’s higher, we consider it an upgrade.

- For downgrades, we create a refund that we record as a credit memo on the
original order.
- For upgrades that require an extra payment, we immediately create a new order
with the prorated amount for the remainder of the billing period.
- For upgrades with the same cost, there’s no payment or refund and we add a
comment to the original order to indicate that the customer changed their
subscription.

In all three cases, the module creates the renewal order with the new plan at
the next billing cycle.

## Changing customer subscriptions in bulk from the command line

You can increase or reduce the subscription price for a specific product, or
change the shipping cost, product name, or tax rates of an order. To do so, you
must migrate existing subscriptions from an old plan to a new one using a CLI
command within the Stripe module.

```
php bin/magento stripe:subscriptions:migrate-subscription-price
<original_product_id> <new_product_id> [<starting_order_id> [<ending_order_id>]]
```

This creates a new order for `new_product_id` as if the customer placed the
order during checkout. The billing and shipping details are the same as the
initial order, and it uses the same payment method for the subscription.

The module recalculates the order totals based on the new tax rules, shipping
method, price changes, and so on. If the original order had any discounts, they
also apply to the new order. The total doesn’t include any of the initial fees.

Successfully placing the order cancels the original order, including the
`original_product_id`. The module adds a comment to the original order
mentioning the migration to a new order, and the cancellation of the associated
subscription in Stripe. The customer also receives a new order email that tells
them their subscription billing details have changed. They can review the new
totals in the same email.

If the module can’t place the order for any reason, the built-in rollback system
cancels the new order creation and leaves the original order intact.

You can use the `original_product_id` as the `new_product_id`, which means that
the module only recalculates the order totals. It’s possible to migrate from
simple subscription products (physical products with a single
[SKU](https://docs.stripe.com/api/skus)) to virtual subscription products, but
not the other way around. This limitation is because physical products require a
shipping address but virtual products don’t.

The order ID parameters are optional. If they’re not specified, the script
processes all orders in your website from all store views and all Stripe modes.
If you have multiple Stripe accounts configured, the script migrates
subscriptions from all Stripe accounts.

## Migrate Stripe Subscriptions from another platform to Adobe Commerce

To migrate subscriptions from another platform, you need to perform the
following tasks:

- Create a mapping between your Adobe Commerce customer IDs and the Stripe
customer IDs in the “stripe_customers” database table of Adobe Commerce. You can
do this with the following SQL statement in your database:

```
INSERT INTO stripe_customers(customer_id, stripe_id, customer_email) VALUES
('2', 'cus_xxxxxxxxxx', 'janedoe@example.com');
```
- Create and configure all subscription products for old orders from the
**Subscriptions by Stripe** tab under each product’s configuration page:

!

Subscription configuration form
- Migrate the orders from your old platform to Adobe Commerce. If you plan on
creating them manually from the Adobe Commerce admin area, you can use the
**Check / Money Order** payment method so it doesn’t collect a live payment.
After you finish the order migration, you can replace this payment method with
Stripe using the following SQL command:

```
UPDATE sales_order_payment SET method='stripe_payments' WHERE method='checkmo';
```
- After creating the orders and products successfully in Adobe Commerce, update
the existing Subscriptions in your Stripe account to set the following metadata:

#### Note

See also how to [create](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/create) or
[update](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/update) subscriptions.
- Test the creation of recurring orders based on subscription renewals:
- Check that you have at least one configured
[webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) in your Stripe Dashboard under
**Developers** > **Webhooks**.
- From your **Stripe Events** section, locate an event that you want to test.
The event type must be `invoice.payment_succeeded` and the Invoice must belong
to a Subscription.
- From your Magento root directory, trigger the event with the following
command: `bin/magento stripe:webhooks:process-event <event_id>`.
- Make sure there were no errors in the console and that the module created a
recurring subscription order in Adobe Commerce.
