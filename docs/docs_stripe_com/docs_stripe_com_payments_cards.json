To complete a payment\nonline, customers enter their card information at checkout. Cards are enabled by\ndefault and are supported by [online payments integration\npaths](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/online-payments#compare-features-and-availability).\nYou can manage payment methods from the\n[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods). Stripe\nhandles the return of eligible payment methods based on factors such as the\ntransaction’s amount, currency, and payment flow.\n\n## Payment flow\n\nA customer initiates a card payment at checkout by entering their credit card\ninformation. Depending on their card network and country location, customers\nhave some card functionalities like additional security verification steps.\n\n![A flowchart showing the three required and one optional step for a customer to\npay with\ncard.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/pay-with-card.059eb99f8cad148c1aea3bb2a29b8284.svg)\n\nCards can act as the funding source for other Stripe payment products and\nmethods like [Link](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link) and\n[wallets](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/wallets). For instance, customers can\nleverage Link to save their card payment data for fast checkout with any\nbusiness that has Link enabled.\n\nWith wallets, customers can store their card details in a [digital\nwallet](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods). From your end, their\npayment method is managed using a `wallet`, but for the customer, the\ntransaction shows up in their card history as a charge from their digital wallet\nprovider.\n\n## Supported card brands\n\nStripe supports several card brands, from large global networks like Visa and\nMastercard to local networks like Cartes Bancaires in France or Interac in\nCanada. When you integrate Stripe, you can begin accepting a diversity of card\nbrands without any additional configurations, including:\n\n- American Express\n- China UnionPay (CUP)\n- Discover & Diners Club\n- eftpos Australia\n- Japan Credit Bureau (JCB)\n- Mastercard\n- Visa\n\nSome card brands require additional configuration, such as [Cartes\nBancaires](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/cartes-bancaires) and\n[Interac](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/regional?integration-country=CA#interac-payments).\n\n#### Note\n\nIn integrations that [handle Link payments as card\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/link-payment-integrations?link-integrations=link-card-integrations),\nnon-card payment methods saved to Link can have a card brand of `link`.\n\n### Online card brand capabilities\n\nThe following table describes some of the different features and restrictions of\neach card brand online, including limitations on countries where Stripe users\ncan accept the brand (Stripe Account Country), countries where most cardholders\nof the brand are located (Customer Country) and support for key features like 3D\nSecure Authentication, and [Wallets](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/wallets)\n(like Apple Pay and Google Pay).\n\n#### Note\n\nOther payment scenarios like setting up [future\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-and-reuse), [saving a\ncard](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-during-payment) or [placing a\nhold](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/place-a-hold-on-a-payment-method) are\nsupported across all card brands.\n\nStripe supports processing payments in [135+\ncurrencies](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies), but some card brand networks\nhave limitations on [supported\ncurrencies](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#presentment-currencies) that\ncharges can be made with.\n\nCard BrandStripe Account CountryCustomer Country 3D Secure Authentication\nWallets VisaAll countriesGlobalMastercardAll countriesGlobalAmerican ExpressAll\ncountries except Brazil, Malaysia, Thailand, and the United Arab EmiratesGlobal,\nexcept India1Discover & Diners ClubCanada, Japan, United Kingdom, United States,\nand the following European Economic Area countries: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus,\nDenmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia,\nLithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia,\nSlovenia, Spain, Sweden, and SwitzerlandGlobalChina UnionPayAustralia, Canada,\nHong Kong, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, United Kingdom, United States,\nSwitzerland, and all countries in the European Economic Area except Croatia,\nIceland, and LichtensteinGlobalNot supportedJapan Credit Bureau (JCB)Australia,\nCanada, Hong Kong, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, Switzerland, United Kingdom,\nUnited States, and all countries in the European Economic Area except\nIcelandGlobalHong Kong, Japan, Singapore, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and all\ncountries in the European Economic Area except IcelandCartes BancairesAll\ncountries in the [SEPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Euro_Payments_Area)\nregion, as well as Canada Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand,\nSingapore, and United StatesFrance2eftposAustraliaAustralia Not supported,\npayments route to the co-brand networkNot supported\n1 For more information, see [American Express card support for India-based\nbusinesses](https://support.stripe.com/questions/american-express-card-support-for-india-based-businesses).\n\n2 Supports Apple Pay. For more information, see [Cartes Bancaires with Apple\nPay](https://docs.stripe.com/apple-pay/cartes-bancaires).\n\n### Exclude card brands\n\nYou can disallow the use of specific card brands in the following ways:\n\n- If you use Stripe Radar, [set up a rule](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules)\nto reject the desired brands.\n- Add custom client-side code that checks the\n[brand](https://docs.stripe.com/api/cards/object#card_object-brand) of a card.\n\n## Geographic considerations\n\nStripe, along with other platforms, offer a solid infrastructure that handles\nsecure payments and complies with specific regulations from different regions.\nThis becomes particularly important with the roll-out of Strong Customer\nAuthentication (SCA) rules in regulated markets like Europe and India, wherein\nadditional verification steps are usually necessary.\n\nIt’s essential to ensure your Stripe integration is lined up with SCA rules and\n3D Secure (3DS) criteria. Moreover, adjusting your approach to suit regional\nnuances—like installment payments and card brand preferences—is vital for\nseamless, compliant, and user-centered transactions.\n\n### SCA and 3D Secure\n\nSome banks, especially in regulated regions like Europe and India, might prompt\nthe customer to authenticate a purchase (for example, by texting the customer a\ncode to enter on the bank’s website). This authentication step is part of\n[Strong Customer\nAuthentication](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication) (SCA)\nRequirements. Making sure that your integration meets SCA requirements for 3DS\ncan sometimes require extra steps.\n\n[SCA](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication), a rule in effect\nas of September 14, 2019, as part of PSD2 regulation in Europe, requires changes\nto how your European customers authenticate online payments. Card payments\nrequire a different user experience, namely\n[3DS](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure), to meet SCA requirements.\n\nStripe supports 3DS by default in Stripe Checkout, Payment Links, and a Hosted\nInvoice Page. You can configure your integration to use 3DS with Subscriptions\nand [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect) with the following:\n\n- [Payment Intents API](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents)\n- [Setup Intents API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents)\n- Elements\n- Mobile SDKs\n\n### Installments\n\nSome regions have card brands that support installment payments - which are\nmanaged by the card issuer and not by creating Subscriptions or using\nSetupIntents with Stripe.\n\nIf you want to create recurring payments and your region or card network doesn’t\nsupport [Meses sin intereses](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/mx-installments),\nsee how to [set up future\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-and-reuse) or\n[Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview).\n\n### Card brand choice\n\nThe European Union requires businesses to allow their customers the option to\npick which card brand processes their transaction because cards in the EU might\nhave both a local network, like Cartes Bancaires, and an affiliated card\nnetwork, like Visa or Mastercard. You can enable this choice using Elements or\nPayments APIs so that [customers can choose which card\nbrand](https://docs.stripe.com/co-badged-cards-compliance) processes their\npayment.\n\n### Accept card payments in India\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has specific regulations for online transactions\nthat apply to Stripe accounts in India. Stripe Support includes a consolidated\nlist of important resources, for many payment methods in the [India\nFAQs](https://support.stripe.com/questions/india-faq).\n\n## See also\n\n- [Integrate card payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/integration-options)\n- [Understand card updates and change default payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/cards/overview#card-updates)\n- [Customize the way PaymentElements handle\ncards](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/customize-payment-methods)\n\n## Links\n\n- [online payments integration\npaths](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/online-payments#compare-features-and-availability)\n- [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods)\n- [Link](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link)\n- [wallets](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/wallets)\n- [digital wallet](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods)\n- [Cartes Bancaires](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/cartes-bancaires)\n-\n[Interac](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/regional?integration-country=CA#interac-payments)\n- [handle Link payments as card\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/link-payment-integrations?link-integrations=link-card-integrations)\n- [future payments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-and-reuse)\n- [saving a card](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-during-payment)\n- [placing a\nhold](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/place-a-hold-on-a-payment-method)\n- [135+ currencies](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies)\n- [supported\ncurrencies](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#presentment-currencies)\n- [SEPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Euro_Payments_Area)\n- [American Express card support for India-based\nbusinesses](https://support.stripe.com/questions/american-express-card-support-for-india-based-businesses)\n- [Cartes Bancaires with Apple\nPay](https://docs.stripe.com/apple-pay/cartes-bancaires)\n- [set up a rule](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules)\n- [brand](https://docs.stripe.com/api/cards/object#card_object-brand)\n- [Strong Customer\nAuthentication](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication)\n- [3DS](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure)\n- [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)\n- [Payment Intents API](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents)\n- [Setup Intents API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents)\n- [Meses sin intereses](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/mx-installments)\n- [Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview)\n- [customers can choose which card\nbrand](https://docs.stripe.com/co-badged-cards-compliance)\n- [India FAQs](https://support.stripe.com/questions/india-faq)\n- [Integrate card payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/integration-options)\n- [Understand card updates and change default payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/cards/overview#card-updates)\n- [Customize the way PaymentElements handle\ncards](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/customize-payment-methods)",
