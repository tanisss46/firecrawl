You can use it to\nvisualize and design embedded UIs in your website.\n\nTo customize the appearance of Connect embedded components, use the `appearance`\noptions when you initialize `StripeConnectInstance`. Connect embedded components\nalready inherit the font-family of their parent HTML element, but you can also\nmake them match with the rest of your site by modifying colors, fonts, borders,\npadding, and so on.\n\n#### Note\n\nThese options are the only way to change styles in Connect embedded components.\nYou can’t override their styles with CSS selectors or other mechanisms. You also\ncan’t eliminate an embedded component’s use of popups in some flows, such as\nuser authentication.\n\nPreviewPaymentsSizeDesktopLocale (United States)[Learn more about the\nPayments component\n→](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/supported-embedded-components/payments)This\ndemo is read-only with limited functionality.
