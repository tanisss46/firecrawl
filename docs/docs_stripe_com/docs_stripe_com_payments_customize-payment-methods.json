It displays the payment\nmethods you enabled, hides any that won’t work for the current transaction, and\nsorts them dynamically for the best conversion rates.\n\nYou can customize its behavior in these ways:\n\n- [Enable different payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/customize-payment-methods#enable-different-payment-methods).\n- [Sort payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/customize-payment-methods#sort-payment-methods)\ndifferently than the default.\n- [Limit the number of payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/customize-payment-methods#limit-payment-method-count)\ndisplayed.\n\n## Enable different payment methods\n\nYou can specify [Dynamic payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/dynamic-payment-methods)\nto enable different payment methods by selecting them in the\n[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods). Stripe\nenables this functionality by default in the latest version of the API.\n\nThis allows Stripe to pull your payment method preferences from the Dashboard to\ndynamically show the most relevant payment methods to your customers.\nAlternatively, you can [list payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-payment_method_types)\nmanually using payment method types.\n\nThere’s one situation where the Payment Element overrides your choice. It hides\npayment methods that don’t support the current payment. For instance, in a\nrecurring payment for 10 JPY, the Payment Element hides methods that don’t\nsupport JPY or recurring payments.\n\n## Sort payment methods\n\nBy default, the Payment Element uses dynamic ordering to optimize which payment\nmethods appear for each user. With the\n[paymentMethodOrder](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_payment_element#payment_element_create-options-paymentMethodOrder)\nparameter, you can override the default order for payment methods in the Payment\nElement, including Apple Pay and Google Pay.\n\nPayment methods that you specify in `paymentMethodOrder` are shown first,\nfollowed by any additional payment methods. If you specify payment method types\nthat Stripe wouldn’t show, they’re ignored.\n\n```\nelements.create('payment', {\n paymentMethodOrder: ['apple_pay', 'google_pay', 'card', 'klarna']\n});\n```\n\nYou can include Apple Pay (`apple_pay`) and Google Pay (`google_pay`) when\nsetting the order for payment methods in addition to a full list of [payment\nmethod\ntypes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object#payment_method_object-type).\nWhen you specify sorting, Stripe applies dynamic ordering to any remaining\navailable payment methods.\n\n#### Regional considerationsFinlandSweden\n\nRegulations in\n[Finland](https://support.stripe.com/questions/payment-method-legislation-in-finland)\nand\n[Sweden](https://support.stripe.com/questions/payment-method-legislation-in-sweden)\nrequire that debit payment methods must be presented before credit payment\nmethods at checkout in those countries.\n\n## Limit the number of payment methods\n\nWhen you use the [accordion\nlayout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element#layout), the Payment\nElement displays up to five payment methods by default and hides the rest behind\na **More** button.\n\nTo adjust the number of payment methods you want to display, set the\n[layout.visibleAccordionItemsCount](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_payment_element#payment_element_create-options-layout-visibleAccordionItemsCount)\nproperty.\n\n```\nelements.create('payment', {\n layout: {\n type: 'accordion',\n // Set a different default, or set to 0 to disable the\n // \"More\" button and render all available Payment Methods\n visibleAccordionItemsCount: 3\n }\n});\n```\n\n## Links\n\n- [Dynamic payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/dynamic-payment-methods)\n- [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods)\n- [list payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-payment_method_types)\n-\n[paymentMethodOrder](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_payment_element#payment_element_create-options-paymentMethodOrder)\n- [payment method\ntypes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object#payment_method_object-type)\n-\n[Finland](https://support.stripe.com/questions/payment-method-legislation-in-finland)\n-\n[Sweden](https://support.stripe.com/questions/payment-method-legislation-in-sweden)\n- [accordion layout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element#layout)\n-\n[layout.visibleAccordionItemsCount](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_payment_element#payment_element_create-options-layout-visibleAccordionItemsCount)",
