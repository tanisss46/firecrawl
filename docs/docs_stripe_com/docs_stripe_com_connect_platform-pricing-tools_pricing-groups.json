  "content": "# Create pricing groups\n\n## Define separate pricing schemes for different connected account groups.\n\nYou can define pricing groups to assign specific pricing schemes to multiple\nconnected accounts simultaneously. This can save time over manually adding or\nupdating the same fee override to each connected account individually.\n\nYou can create up to 50 groups across all pricing schemes.\n\n## Assign groups to a pricing scheme\n\nYou can define up to 50 pricing schemes per product (such as Payments or Instant\nPayouts) and apply each to one or more groups of [eligible connected\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/platform-pricing-tools#eligibility-for-payments).\nYou can enable only one pricing scheme to a connected account.\n\nTo create a new schema and define a pricing group:\n\n- From the Payments tab of the [Platform\npricing](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/platform_pricing) page in\nyour Stripe Dashboard (**Settings** > **Connect** > **Platform pricing**), click\n**+ Add scheme**.\n- Select **Create a new scheme** or **Start from an existing scheme**.\n- Name your scheme.\n- Define your scheme with pricing rules, fallback rules and fee modifiers using\nthe instructions in [create a pricing\nscheme](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/platform-pricing-tools/pricing-schemes).\n- Assign a group to your scheme.- Type a name and click **+ Add** to create a\nnew group. After you save the scheme, you can [add accounts to your new\ngroup](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/platform-pricing-tools/pricing-groups#add-accounts-to-groups).\n- Alternatively, click **Reassign a group** to choose an existing group, then\nclick **+ Reassign**\n- Click **Save and enable** and review the details of your schema, including its\nassigned groups and the number of accounts in each group. Click **Confirm** to\nsubmit the changes.\n- Click the overflow menu () of a scheme, then click **Edit** to make changes.\n\n## Add accounts to groups\n\nYou can add connected accounts to existing groups using the following methods:\n\n- **CSV import**: Takes effect immediately, but group counts in the UI take a\nfew minutes to update.\n- **API**: Takes effect immediately.\n\nRecent group assignment changes take up to 24 hours to reflect in CSV exports.\n\n### CSV Import\n\nUse the Dashboard to import a CSV file defining the connected accounts to add to\na group.\n\n- the GroupID of the group you want to add accounts to.\n- Click the overflow menu () of the group’s pricing scheme, then select **Add\naccounts**.\n- Download the pre-configured CSV for the group (or create your own).\n- Populate the following two columns for each connected account to add.-\n**connected_account**: `account id` of a connected account to assign to this\ngroup.\n- **account_group**: `group id` of the group to add the account to.\n- Click **Upload CSV** and select your completed file.\n- Stripe validates the file and returns the number of connected accounts in your\nplatform *not* included in the file. This helps you make sure you didn’t\nunintentionally omit any users.\n- Click **Confirm** to complete the import.\n\n### API\n\nBefore assigning a connected account into a pricing group, obtain the group ID\n(`acctgrp_xxx`) from the Platform Pricing page in your Dashboard.\n\n#### Assign a group to an existing account\n\n- Populate the `groups.payments_pricing` parameter of the [Update an\naccount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/update) call with the `ID` of the\ngroup to assign the account to.\n- [Expand](https://docs.stripe.com/expand) the `groups` object to request the\n`groups` parameter in the response.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts/{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}} \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d \"groups[payments_pricing]\"=acctgrp_NrikrzNEvHZ4go \\\n -d \"expand[]\"=groups\n```\n\nThe response returns the connected account object with the expanded `groups`\nparameter.\n\n```\n{\n // ...\n \"groups\": {\n \"payments_pricing\": \"acctgrp_NrikrzNEvHZ4go\"\n }\n}\n```\n\n#### Assign a group when creating a new account\n\n- Populate the `groups` parameter of the [Create an\naccount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/create) call with the `name` and\n`ID` of the group to assign it to the account.\n\nAlternatively, omit the `groups` parameter during account creation to\nautomatically assign the account to the default group. All eligible connected\naccounts without a specific group designation belong to the default group.\n- [Expand](https://docs.stripe.com/expand) the `groups` object to request the\n`groups` parameter in the response.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d \"groups[payments_pricing]\"=acctgrp_NrikrzNEvHZ4go \\\n -d \"expand[]\"=groups\n```\n\nThe response returns the new connected account object with the expanded `groups`\nparameter.\n\n```\n{\n // ...\n \"groups\": {\n \"payments_pricing\": \"acctgrp_NrikrzNEvHZ4go\"\n }\n}\n```\n\n#### Retrieve the group of an account\n\nExpand the `groups` parameter in the Accounts lookup call to see the account’s\npricing group. If the `payments_pricing` group has a null value, the connected\naccount has a [pricing\noverride](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/platform-pricing-tools/pricing-schemes#override-a-specific-account).\n\n```\ncurl -G https://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts/{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}} \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d \"expand[]\"=groups\n```\n\nThe response returns the new connected account object with the expanded `groups`\nparameter.\n\n```\n{\n // ...\n \"groups\": {\n \"payments_pricing\": \"acctgrp_NrikrzNEvHZ4go\"\n }\n}\ngated=[\"groups\"]\n```\n\n## Unassign a pricing group from a pricing scheme\n\nTo disassociate a group and it’s connected accounts from a pricing scheme:\n\n- Click the overflow menu () of the pricing scheme, then select **Edit**.\n- In the **Assign groups** section, click the overflow menu () of the intended\ngroup, then select **Unassign**.\n- Click **Save and Enable**, then **Confirm**.\n\nThis doesn’t delete the pricing group with its associated connected accounts. It\nreassigns the pricing group to the default pricing scheme. You can still\n[reassign the pricing group to a different\nscheme](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/platform-pricing-tools/pricing-groups#assign-groups-to-a-pricing-scheme).\n\n## Delete a pricing group\n\nYou can delete a pricing group and reassign its connected accounts to the\npricing group associated with the default pricing scheme. You can only delete a\npricing group from the Dashboard.\n\n#### Caution\n\nDeleting a pricing group that you still reference in your API calls can break\nyour integration.\n\n- Click the overflow menu () of the pricing scheme, then select **Edit**.\n- In the **Assign groups** section, click the overflow menu () of the intended\ngroup, then select **Delete**.\n- Click **Save and Enable**, then **Confirm**.\n\nAny connected accounts in a deleted pricing group get reassigned to the pricing\ngroup of the default pricing scheme.\n\n## View accounts assigned to a payments pricing scheme\n\nYou can download a CSV list of connected accounts and their assigned groups for\na pricing scheme. From the [Platform\nPricing](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/platform_pricing) page of\nyour Dashboard, click the overflow menu () of the pricing scheme, then select\n**Export accounts**.\n\nYou can also download a CSV list of all connected accounts and their assigned\nschemes by clicking **Export accounts** at the top of the [Platform\nPricing](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/platform_pricing) page.\n\n## Links\n\n-\n[override](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/platform-pricing-tools/pricing-schemes#override-a-specific-account)\n- [eligible connected\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/platform-pricing-tools#eligibility-for-payments)\n- [Platform\npricing](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/platform_pricing)\n- [create a pricing\nscheme](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/platform-pricing-tools/pricing-schemes)\n- [Update an account](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/update)\n- [Expand](https://docs.stripe.com/expand)\n- [Create an account](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/create)",
