Go to the [Stripe\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and enable\nSwish. To get started with one of our hosted UIs, follow a quickstart:\n\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart): Our prebuilt, hosted\ncheckout page.\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart): Our drop-in UI\ncomponents.\n\n### Other payment products\n\nThe following Stripe products also let you add Swish from the Dashboard:\n\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n\n## Merchant of record\n\nFor Swish payments, Stripe operates as the merchant of record. Therefore,\nStripe’s name appears as the recipient of payments in the Swish app and as the\nstatement descriptor in the customer’s bank statements. Your business name\nappears in the message field in the Swish app. The factoring addendum in the\n[Swish terms](https://stripe.com/legal/swish) applies.\n\n## Prohibited business categories\n\nIn addition to the industry and business categories listed in [Prohibited and\nRestricted Businesses](https://stripe.com/restricted-businesses), the following\ncategories aren’t allowed to use Swish:\n\n- Precious stones and metals, watches and jewelry\n- Digital wallet top-ups\n\nFor more information about Swish eligibility for your account, navigate to your\n[Payment methods\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods).\n\n## Refunds\n\nYou can refund Swish charges up to 365 days after the payment completes. Refunds\nusually take a few minutes to complete. Swish supports full and partial refunds.\nYou can also issue multiple partial refunds up to the amount of the original\ncharge.\n\n## Connect\n\nYou can use [Stripe Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/how-connect-works)\nwith Swish to process payments on behalf of a connected account.
