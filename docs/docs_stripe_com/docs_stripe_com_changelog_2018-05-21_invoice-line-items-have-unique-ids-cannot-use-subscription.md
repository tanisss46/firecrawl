# Invoice line items now have unique IDs andcan't be used in place of a subscriptionBreaking changes

## What’s new

The `id` field of invoice line items of `type=subscription` can no longer be
interpreted as a subscription ID. It’s now a unique invoice line item ID, which
you can use for pagination.

## Impact

This change alters the meaning of the `id` field for subscription-type invoice
line items, making it a unique identifier for the line item itself rather than a
subscription ID. You can now use this `id` for pagination purposes when working
with invoice line items. This might require updates to existing code that relies
on interpreting these `id` values as subscription IDs.
