Go to the [Stripe\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and enable\nCapchase Pay. To get started with one of our hosted UIs, follow a quickstart:\n\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart): Our prebuilt, hosted\ncheckout page.\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart): Our drop-in UI\ncomponents.\n\n### Other payment products\n\nThe following Stripe products also let you add Capchase Pay from the Dashboard:\n\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n\nIf your integration requires manually listing payment methods, learn how to\n[manually configure Capchase Pay as a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/capchase-pay/accept-a-payment).\n\n## Payment options\n\nThe minimum charge limit is 2,500.00 USD.\n\nThe maximum charge limit is 999,999.99 USD.\n\n## Allowed business categories\n\nThe following business categories are the only ones allowed to use Capchase Pay:\n\n- Computer Network Services\n- Computer Programming\n- Computer Software Stores\n- Computers, Peripherals, and Software\n- Digital Goods – Applications (Excludes Games)\n- Information Retrieval Services\n- Other categories at the discretion of Capchase Pay\n\n## Additional requirements\n\nBy enabling Capchase Pay, acknowledge that:\n\n- Disputes between you and your customer will not impact the customer’s\nobligation to pay Capchase.\n- Where a customer fails to comply with its payment obligation, you will\ncooperate with Capchase and promptly suspend that customer’s access to your\nproduct, software, or services upon receipt of a written request from Capchase.\n- You are responsible for maintaining commercially reasonable business practices\nconsistent with the industry standards applicable to you in your fulfillment of\nyour obligations under your contracts with customers.\n\n## Disputes\n\nCapchase Pay has a claims process that allows transaction disputes. Customers\ncan open disputes for cases of suspected fraud, double payments, or a difference\nbetween an order and a transaction amount.\n\nAfter the customer initiates a dispute, Stripe notifies you using:\n\n- Email\n- The Stripe Dashboard\n- An API `charge.dispute.created` event (if your integration is set up to\nreceive [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks))\n\nStripe holds back the disputed amount from your balance until Capchase Pay\nresolves the dispute.\n\nWe request that you upload compelling evidence proving that you fulfilled the\npurchase order [using the Stripe\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/responding#respond). This evidence\ncan include the:\n\n- Tracking ID\n- Shipping date\n- Record of purchase for intangible goods, such as IP address or email receipt\n- Record of purchase for services or physical goods, such as phone number or\nproof of receipt\n- Record of refund (for purchase you’ve already refunded)\n\nTo handle disputes programmatically, [respond to disputes using the\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/api).\n\nThis information helps Capchase Pay determine if a dispute is valid. Make sure\nthe evidence you provide contains as much detail as possible from what the\ncustomer provided at checkout. You must submit the requested information within\n12 calendar days. If Capchase Pay resolves the dispute with you winning, we\nreturn the disputed amount to your Stripe balance. If Capchase Pay rules in\nfavor of the customer, the balance charge becomes permanent.\n\n## Refunds\n\nCapchase Pay supports full and partial refunds. The refund period is up to 180\ndays after the purchase. Refunds for Capchase Pay payments are asynchronous and\ntake up to 5 minutes to complete. Stripe notifies you of the final refund status\nusing the `refund.updated` or `refund.failed`\n[webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) event. When a refund succeeds, the\n[Refund](https://docs.stripe.com/api/refunds/object) object’s status transitions\nto `succeeded`. If a refund fails, the `Refund` object’s status transitions to\n`failed` and we return the amount to your Stripe balance. You’ll then need to\narrange an alternative way of providing your customer with a refund.\n\n## Connect\n\nIf you use [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect), you must consider the\nfollowing before you enable and use Capchase Pay.\n\n### Request Capchase Pay capabilities for your connected accounts\n\nSet the `capchase_pay_payments` capability to `active` on your platform account,\nand on any connected accounts you want to enable Capchase Pay for.
