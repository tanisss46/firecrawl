Save the .txt file with the\nfilename **Stripe_Import_Key.txt** on your desktop.\n- Add the key to your list of known keys using your command-line interface:\n\n- Navigate to your desktop: `cd ~/Desktop`.\n- Type the command: `gpg --import \"Stripe Import Key\"`.\n- Confirm the output matches:\n\n```\ncd ~/Desktop\n\ngpg --import Stripe_Import_Key.txt\ngpg: key 9C78B7620C1E99AD: public key \"Stripe Import Key (PCI)\n<support-migrations@stripe.com>\" imported\ngpg: Total number processed: 1\ngpg: imported: 1\n\n```\n- Verify the key with the command: `gpg --list-keys`.\n- Encrypt the non-encrypted data file with that key: `gpg --recipient \"Stripe\nImport Key (PCI)\" --encrypt 20240418_rocket_rides_cards.csv`. The action returns\nan encrypted GPG file, such as **20240418_rocket_rides_cards.csv.gpg**. The\noutput looks like:\n\n```\ngpg --recipient \"Stripe Import Key (PCI)\" --encrypt\n20240418_rocket_rides_cards.csv\n\ngpg: 8A3B0AC7944266D9: There is no assurance this key belongs to the named user\n\nsub rsa4096/8A3B0AC7944266D9 2023-04-11 Stripe Import Key (PCI)\n<support-migrations@stripe.com>\n Primary key fingerprint: AEBF 7C48 38C4 4D2F DC99 A3F9 9C78 B762 0C1E 99AD\n Subkey fingerprint: 2100 F77A 7937 9D29 9C96 420B 8A3B 0AC7 9442 66D9\n\nIt is NOT certain that the key belongs to the person named in the user ID.\nIf you *really* know what you are doing, you may answer the next question\nwith yes.\n\nUse this key anyway? (y/N) y\n\n```\n\n## Upload your encrypted file\n\nThe Stripe Data Migration team securely emails or texts your SFTP access\ncredentials to you. You must log into you Stripe account and submit your\nmigration request using the [secure intake request\nform](https://support.stripe.com/contact/email?topic=migrations) to obtain\naccess credentials.\n\n- Save the file to upload on your desktop.\n- Navigate to the desktop in your command-line: `cd ~/Desktop`.\n- Connect to Stripe’s SFTP server with the command: `sftp -P 22\n<username>@sftp.stripe.com` (where `<username>` is the username provided by the\nStripe Data Migrations Team).\n- Provide your password when prompted, then press **Enter**.\n- Upload the file to the SFTP account with the command: `put <file name>`, where\n`<file name>` is the name of the data file to upload, such as\n`20240418_rocket_rides_cards.csv.gpg`.\n- After you upload the file, you might not see the file in the folder, though it\ntransferred successfully. You can view a successful status file under the\nupload-success directory.\n\n```\nsftp -P 22 username@sftp.stripe.com\n\nusername@sftp.stripe.com's password:\nConnected to sftp.stripe.com.\nsftp> put 20240418_rocket_rides_cards.csv.gpg\nUploading 20240418_rocket_rides_cards.csv.gpg to\n/20240418_rocket_rides_cards.csv.gpg\n\n20240418_rocket_rides_cards.csv.gpg 100% 663 26.5KB/s 00:00\n\n```\n\n## Links\n\n- [download the GnuPG software](https://www.gnupg.org/)\n- [Download the Stripe public\nkey](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/data-migrations/pan-import#migration-pgp-key)\n- [secure intake request\nform](https://support.stripe.com/contact/email?topic=migrations)",
