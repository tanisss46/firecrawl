  "content": "# Payouts to connected accounts\n\n## Manage payouts and external accounts for your platform's connected accounts.\n\nBy default, any [charge](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges) you make on\nbehalf of a connected account accumulates in the connected account’s\n[balance](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-balances) and is paid out on a\ndaily rolling basis. Depending on the configuration of your connected accounts,\nyour platform can manage their payouts as follows:\n\n- Schedule [the frequency of automatic\npayouts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/manage-payout-schedule)\n- Perform [manual payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/manual-payouts)\n- Settle funds [instantly](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/instant-payouts)\n- When using [destination\ncharges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges) or [separate\ncharges and\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers),\nretain funds in your platform balance\n\n#### Note\n\nIn versions of Connect earlier than 2018, payouts were known as bank transfers\nand used the deprecated `transfers` API. For information about bank transfers,\nsee the legacy [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/legacy-transfers)\ndocumentation.\n\n## Payout management configurations\n\nFor connected accounts with access to the full Stripe Dashboard or Express\nDashboard, the account holder manages their external\n[payout](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts) accounts (bank accounts and debit\ncards), but the platform can schedule payouts. To schedule payouts for an\naccount that has access to the full Stripe Dashboard, the platform must\nconfigure [Platform\ncontrols](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/platform-controls-for-stripe-dashboard-accounts)\nfor the account.\n\nFor connected accounts without access to a Stripe-hosted Dashboard, the platform\nmanages their external payout accounts and can schedule their payouts.\n\n## Supported settlement currencies\n\nTo see which currencies you can use to settle funds in a particular country,\nselect that country from the following dropdown.\n\n#### Note\n\nFor a list of supported presentment currencies, see the\n[currencies](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#presentment-currencies)\ndocumentation.\n\nViewing supported settlement currencies for Stripe accounts in:Albania\n(AL)Algeria (DZ)Angola (AO)Antigua & Barbuda (AG)Argentina (AR)Armenia\n(AM)Australia (AU)Austria (AT)Azerbaijan (AZ)Bahamas (BS)Bahrain (BH)Bangladesh\n(BD)Belgium (BE)Benin (BJ)Bhutan (BT)Bolivia (BO)Bosnia & Herzegovina\n(BA)Botswana (BW)Brazil (BR)Brunei (BN)Bulgaria (BG)Cambodia (KH)Canada\n(CA)Chile (CL)Colombia (CO)Costa Rica (CR)Côte d’Ivoire (CI)Croatia (HR)Cyprus\n(CY)Czech Republic (CZ)Denmark (DK)Dominican Republic (DO)Ecuador (EC)Egypt\n(EG)El Salvador (SV)Estonia (EE)Ethiopia (ET)Finland (FI)France (FR)Gabon\n(GA)Gambia (GM)Germany (DE)Ghana (GH)Gibraltar (GI)Greece (GR)Guatemala\n(GT)Guyana (GY)Hong Kong (HK)Hungary (HU)Iceland (IS)India (IN)Indonesia\n(ID)Ireland (IE)Israel (IL)Italy (IT)Jamaica (JM)Japan (JP)Jordan (JO)Kazakhstan\n(KZ)Kenya (KE)Kuwait (KW)Laos (LA)Latvia (LV)Liechtenstein (LI)Lithuania\n(LT)Luxembourg (LU)Macao SAR China (MO)Madagascar (MG)Malaysia (MY)Malta\n(MT)Mauritius (MU)Mexico (MX)Moldova (MD)Monaco (MC)Mongolia (MN)Morocco\n(MA)Mozambique (MZ)Namibia (NA)Netherlands (NL)New Zealand (NZ)Niger (NE)Nigeria\n(NG)North Macedonia (MK)Norway (NO)Oman (OM)Pakistan (PK)Panama (PA)Paraguay\n(PY)Peru (PE)Philippines (PH)Poland (PL)Portugal (PT)Qatar (QA)Romania\n(RO)Rwanda (RW)San Marino (SM)Saudi Arabia (SA)Senegal (SN)Serbia (RS)Singapore\n(SG)Slovakia (SK)Slovenia (SI)South Africa (ZA)South Korea (KR)Spain (ES)Sri\nLanka (LK)St. Lucia (LC)Sweden (SE)Switzerland (CH)Taiwan (TW)Tanzania\n(TZ)Thailand (TH)Trinidad & Tobago (TT)Tunisia (TN)Turkey (TR)United Arab\nEmirates (AE)United Kingdom (GB)United States (US)Uruguay (UY)Uzbekistan\n(UZ)Vietnam (VN)Accounts created in United States and that are under the [full\nservice agreement](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/service-agreement-types#full)\ncan receive payouts in the following settlement currencies.Settlement\ncurrencyCan be paid out to banks in these countriesUSDUnited States\nPlatforms can also enable their connected accounts to settle funds and pay out\nto banks in certain non-primary currencies, or pay out to non-domestic bank\naccounts in the local currency. In some cases, Stripe charges a fee. For more\ninformation, see [multi-currency settlement for Connect marketplaces and\nplatforms](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/multicurrency-settlement).\n\n### Use webhooks with payouts\n\nYou can track all payout activity on connected accounts with webhooks by\ncreating an [event destination](https://docs.stripe.com/event-destinations) and\nlistening for these events:\n\n- `payout.created`\n- `payout.updated`\n- `payout.paid`\n- `payout.failed`\n\nFor most payouts, event notifications occur over a series of days. Instant\npayouts typically send `payout.paid` within 30 minutes.\n\nWhen a payout can’t be completed, a `payout.failed` event occurs. The event’s\n`failure_code` property indicates the reason. A failed payout also disables the\nexternal account involved in that payout, triggering an\n`account.external_account.updated` event. No payouts can be made to that\nexternal account until the platform updates the connected account’s external\naccounts.\n\n## Links\n\n- [charge](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges)\n- [balance](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-balances)\n- [the frequency of automatic\npayouts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/manage-payout-schedule)\n- [manual payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/manual-payouts)\n- [instantly](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/instant-payouts)\n- [destination charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges)\n- [separate charges and\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n- [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/legacy-transfers)\n- [payout](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts)\n- [Platform\ncontrols](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/platform-controls-for-stripe-dashboard-accounts)\n- [currencies](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#presentment-currencies)\n- [full service\nagreement](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/service-agreement-types#full)\n- [multi-currency settlement for Connect marketplaces and\nplatforms](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/multicurrency-settlement)\n- [event destination](https://docs.stripe.com/event-destinations)",
