# API Worksheet OverviewPublic preview

## Use the in-browser Stripe Shell to practice implementing key business processes.

Stripe’s API Worksheets provide a low-friction environment to check your
knowledge as you work through becoming a certified Stripe Partner. The
worksheets take you through a narrative that prompts you to:

- Practice using Stripe’s API without leaving your browser
- Find relevant documentation
- Explain how and why the API behaves the way it does

As you work through each prompt, we will provide just-in-time feedback to help
you find the information you need, right when you need it.

If you’re training for Stripe’s [Partner Program](https://stripe.com/partners),
use these as a follow-up to our e-learning courses. If you’re learning about
Stripe’s APIs on your own, consider first exploring our [Quickstart
guide](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart) on implementing a custom
payment flow before starting these worksheets.
