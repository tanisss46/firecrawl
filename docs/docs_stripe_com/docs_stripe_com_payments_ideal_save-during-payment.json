  "content": "# Save bank details during an iDEAL payment\n\n## Learn how to save your customer's IBAN bank details from an iDEAL payment.\n\n#### Caution\n\nWe recommend that you follow the [Save payment details during\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-during-payment) guide. If you’ve\nalready integrated with Elements, see the [Payment Element migration\nguide](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element/migration).\n\niDEAL is a popular [single\nuse](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#usage) payment method in\nthe Netherlands where customers are required to\n[authenticate](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#customer-actions)\ntheir payment. [Customers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers) pay with iDEAL\nby redirecting to a webview, authorizing the payment, then returning to your app\nwhere you get [immediate\nnotification](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#payment-notification)\non whether the payment succeeded or failed.\n\nYou can also use iDEAL to save your customer’s\n[IBAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Bank_Account_Number) bank\ndetails into a [SEPA Direct Debit](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sepa-debit)\n[PaymentMethod](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods). You can then use\nthe SEPA Direct Debit PaymentMethod to [accept\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sepa-debit/accept-a-payment) or [set\nup a subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/sepa-debit).\nThis reduces friction for your customer as they don’t have to enter their IBAN\nagain. You also receive their verified name and validated IBAN.\n\n#### Caution\n\nTo use iDEAL to set up SEPA Direct Debit payments, you must activate SEPA Direct\nDebit in the\n[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/payments/settings). You must\nalso comply with the [iDEAL Terms of Service](https://stripe.com/ideal/legal)\nand [SEPA Direct Debit Terms of\nService](https://stripe.com/sepa-direct-debit/legal).\n\nWebiOSAndroidReact Native\nAccepting iDEAL payments consists of creating a\n[PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object) object to\ntrack a payment, collecting payment method details and mandate acknowledgement,\nand submitting the payment to Stripe for processing. Stripe uses the\nPaymentIntent to track and handle all the states of the payment until the\npayment completes. Use the ID of the SEPA Direct Debit\n[PaymentMethod](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods) collected from your\ninitial iDEAL PaymentIntent to create future payments.\n\n[Set up\nStripeServer-side](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ideal/save-during-payment#web-set-up-stripe)\nFirst, you need a Stripe account. [Register\nnow](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register).\n\nUse our official libraries for access to the Stripe API from your application:\n\n```\n# Available as a gem\nsudo gem install stripe\n```\n\n```\n# If you use bundler, you can add this line to your Gemfile\ngem 'stripe'\n```\n\n[Create a\nCustomerServer-side](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ideal/save-during-payment#create-customer)\nCreate a [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers) when they create an\naccount with your business and associate it with your internal representation of\ntheir account. This enables you to retrieve and use their saved payment method\ndetails later.\n\n```\ncurl -X POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\"\n```\n\n[Create a\nPaymentIntentServer-side](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ideal/save-during-payment#web-create-payment-intent)\nCreate a `PaymentIntent` on your server and specify the `amount` to collect, the\n`eur` currency, the customer ID, and `off_session` as an argument for [setup\nfuture\nusage](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-setup_future_usage).\nThere is no minimum charge amount and iDEAL doesn’t support other currencies. If\nyou have an existing [Payment Intents\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents) integration, add `ideal`\nto the list of [payment method\ntypes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-payment_method_types).\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d amount=1099 \\\n -d currency=eur \\\n -d \"payment_method_types[]\"=ideal \\\n -d customer={{CUSTOMER_ID}} \\\n -d setup_future_usage=off_session\n```\n\n### Retrieve the client secret\n\nThe PaymentIntent includes a [client\nsecret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-client_secret)\nthat the client side uses to securely complete the payment process. You can use\ndifferent approaches to pass the client secret to the client side.\n\nSingle-page applicationServer-side rendering\nRetrieve the client secret from an endpoint on your server, using the browser’s\n`fetch` function. This approach is best if your client side is a single-page\napplication, particularly one built with a modern frontend framework like React.\nCreate the server endpoint that serves the client secret:\n\n```\nget '/secret' do\n intent = # ... Create or retrieve the PaymentIntent\n {client_secret: intent.client_secret}.to_json\nend\n```\n\nAnd then fetch the client secret with JavaScript on the client side:\n\n```\n(async () => {\n const response = await fetch('/secret');\n const {client_secret: clientSecret} = await response.json();\n // Render the form using the clientSecret\n})();\n```\n\n[Collect payment method\ndetailsClient-side](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ideal/save-during-payment#web-collect-payment-method-details)\nCollect payment details on the client with the [Payment\nElement](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element). The Payment Element\nis a prebuilt UI component that simplifies collecting payment details for a\nvariety of payment methods.\n\nThe Payment Element contains an iframe that securely sends payment information\nto Stripe over an HTTPS connection. Avoid placing the Payment Element within\nanother iframe because some payment methods require redirecting to another page\nfor payment confirmation.\n\nThe checkout page address must start with `https://` rather than `http://` for\nyour integration to work. You can test your integration without using HTTPS, but\nremember to [enable it](https://docs.stripe.com/security/guide#tls) when you’re\nready to accept live payments.\n\nHTML + JSReact\n### Set up Stripe.js\n\nThe Payment Element is automatically available as a feature of Stripe.js.\nInclude the Stripe.js script on your checkout page by adding it to the `head` of\nyour HTML file. Always load Stripe.js directly from js.stripe.com to remain PCI\ncompliant. Don’t include the script in a bundle or host a copy of it yourself.\n\n```\n<head>\n <title>Checkout</title>\n <script src=\"https://js.stripe.com/v3/\"></script>\n</head>\n```\n\nCreate an instance of Stripe with the following JavaScript on your checkout\npage:\n\n```\n// Set your publishable key: remember to change this to your live publishable\nkey in production\n// See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys\nconst stripe = Stripe('pk_test_TYooMQauvdEDq54NiTphI7jx');\n```\n\n### Add the Payment Element to your payment page\n\nThe Payment Element needs a place to live on your payment page. Create an empty\nDOM node (container) with a unique ID in your payment form:\n\n```\n<form id=\"payment-form\">\n <div id=\"payment-element\">\n <!-- Elements will create form elements here -->\n </div>\n <button id=\"submit\">Submit</button>\n <div id=\"error-message\">\n <!-- Display error message to your customers here -->\n </div>\n</form>\n```\n\nWhen the previous form loads, create an instance of the Payment Element and\nmount it to the container DOM node. Pass the [client\nsecret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-client_secret)\nfrom the previous step into `options` when you create the\n[Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create) instance:\n\nHandle the client secret carefully because it can complete the charge. Don’t log\nit, embed it in URLs, or expose it to anyone but the customer.\n\n```\nconst options = {\n clientSecret: '{{CLIENT_SECRET}}',\n // Fully customizable with appearance API.\n appearance: {/*...*/},\n};\n\n// Set up Stripe.js and Elements to use in checkout form, passing the client\nsecret obtained in a previous step\nconst elements = stripe.elements(options);\n// Optional: Autofill user's saved payment methods. If the customer's\n// email is known when the page is loaded, you can pass the email\n// to the linkAuthenticationElement on mount:\n//\n// linkAuthenticationElement.mount(\"#link-authentication-element\", {\n// defaultValues: {\n// email: 'jenny.rosen@example.com',\n// }\n// })\n\n// Create and mount the Payment Element\nconst paymentElementOptions = { layout: 'accordion'};\nconst paymentElement = elements.create('payment', paymentElementOptions);\npaymentElement.mount('#payment-element');\n```\n\n[Submit the payment to\nStripeClient-side](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ideal/save-during-payment#web-submit-payment)\nUse\n[stripe.confirmPayment](https://docs.stripe.com/js/payment_intents/confirm_payment)\nto complete the payment using details from the Payment Element. Provide a\n[return_url](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-return_url)\nto this function to indicate where Stripe should redirect the user after they\ncomplete the payment. Your user may be first redirected to an intermediate site,\nlike a bank authorization page, before being redirected to the `return_url`.\nCard payments immediately redirect to the `return_url` when a payment is\nsuccessful.\n\nHTML + JSReact\n```\nconst form = document.getElementById('payment-form');\n\nform.addEventListener('submit', async (event) => {\n event.preventDefault();\n\n const {error} = await stripe.confirmPayment({\n //`Elements` instance that was used to create the Payment Element\n elements,\n confirmParams: {\n return_url: 'https://example.com/order/123/complete',\n },\n });\n\n if (error) {\n // This point will only be reached if there is an immediate error when\n // confirming the payment. Show error to your customer (for example, payment\n // details incomplete)\n const messageContainer = document.querySelector('#error-message');\n messageContainer.textContent = error.message;\n } else {\n // Your customer will be redirected to your `return_url`. For some payment\n // methods like iDEAL, your customer will be redirected to an intermediate\n // site first to authorize the payment, then redirected to the `return_url`.\n }\n});\n```\n\n#### Note\n\n`stripe.confirmPayment` may take several seconds to complete. During that time,\ndisable your form from being resubmitted and show a waiting indicator like a\nspinner. If you receive an error, show it to the customer, re-enable the form,\nand hide the waiting indicator. If the customer must perform additional steps to\ncomplete the payment, such as authentication, Stripe.js walks them through that\nprocess.\n\nIf the payment succeeded, the card is saved to the Customer object. This is\nreflected on the [PaymentMethod](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods)’s\n[customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object#payment_method_object-customer)\nfield. At this point, associate the ID of the\n[Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers) object with your own internal\nrepresentation of a customer, if you have one. Now you can use the stored\nPaymentMethod object to collect payments from your customer in the future\nwithout prompting them for their payment details again.\n\nMake sure the `return_url` corresponds to a page on your website that provides\nthe status of the payment. When Stripe redirects the customer to the\n`return_url`, we provide the following URL query parameters:\n\nParameterDescription`payment_intent`The unique identifier for the\n`PaymentIntent`.`payment_intent_client_secret`The [client\nsecret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-client_secret)\nof the `PaymentIntent` object.\n#### Caution\n\nIf you have tooling that tracks the customer’s browser session, you might need\nto add the `stripe.com` domain to the referrer exclude list. Redirects cause\nsome tools to create new sessions, which prevents you from tracking the complete\nsession.\n\nUse one of the query parameters to retrieve the PaymentIntent. Inspect the\n[status of the\nPaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/paymentintents/lifecycle) to\ndecide what to show your customers. You can also append your own query\nparameters when providing the `return_url`, which persist through the redirect\nprocess.\n\nHTML + JSReact\n```\n// Initialize Stripe.js using your publishable key\nconst stripe = Stripe('pk_test_TYooMQauvdEDq54NiTphI7jx');\n\n// Retrieve the \"payment_intent_client_secret\" query parameter appended to\n// your return_url by Stripe.js\nconst clientSecret = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get(\n 'payment_intent_client_secret'\n);\n\n// Retrieve the PaymentIntent\nstripe.retrievePaymentIntent(clientSecret).then(({paymentIntent}) => {\n const message = document.querySelector('#message')\n\n // Inspect the PaymentIntent `status` to indicate the status of the payment\n // to your customer.\n //\n // Some payment methods will [immediately succeed or fail][0] upon\n // confirmation, while others will first enter a `processing` state.\n //\n // [0]: https://stripe.com/docs/payments/payment-methods#payment-notification\n switch (paymentIntent.status) {\n case 'succeeded':\n message.innerText = 'Success! Payment received.';\n break;\n\n case 'processing':\nmessage.innerText = \"Payment processing. We'll update you when payment is\nreceived.\";\n break;\n\n case 'requires_payment_method':\n message.innerText = 'Payment failed. Please try another payment method.';\n // Redirect your user back to your payment page to attempt collecting\n // payment again\n break;\n\n default:\n message.innerText = 'Something went wrong.';\n break;\n }\n});\n```\n\n[Charge the SEPA Direct Debit PaymentMethod\nlater](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ideal/save-during-payment#web-charge-sepa-pm)\nWhen you need to charge your customer again, create a new PaymentIntent. Find\nthe ID of the SEPA Direct Debit payment method by\n[retrieving](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/retrieve) the previous\nPaymentIntent and [expanding](https://docs.stripe.com/api/expanding_objects) the\n`latest_charge` field where you will find the `generated_sepa_debit` ID inside\nof `payment_method_details`.\n\n```\ncurl -G https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents/{{PAYMENT_INTENT_ID}} \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d \"expand[]\"=latest_charge\n```\n\nThe SEPA Direct Debit payment method ID is the `generated_sepa_debit` ID under\n[payment_method_details](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-payment_method_details-ideal)\nin the response.\n\n```\n{\n \"latest_charge\": {\n \"payment_method_details\": {\n \"ideal\": {\n \"bank\": \"ing\",\n \"bic\": \"INGBNL2A\",\n \"iban_last4\": \"****\",\n \"generated_sepa_debit\": \"pm_1GrddXGf98efjktuBIi3ag7aJQ\",\n \"verified_name\": \"JENNY ROSEN\"\n },\n \"type\": \"ideal\"\n },\n },\n \"payment_method_options\": {\n \"ideal\": {}\n```\n\nSee all 30 lines\nCreate a PaymentIntent with the SEPA Direct Debit and Customer IDs.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d \"payment_method_types[]\"=sepa_debit \\\n -d amount=1099 \\\n -d currency=eur \\\n -d customer={{CUSTOMER_ID}} \\\n -d payment_method={{SEPA_DEBIT_PAYMENT_METHOD_ID}} \\\n -d confirm=true\n```\n\n[Test your\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ideal/save-during-payment#test-your-integration)\nUse your [test API keys](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes) to\nconfirm the PaymentIntent.
