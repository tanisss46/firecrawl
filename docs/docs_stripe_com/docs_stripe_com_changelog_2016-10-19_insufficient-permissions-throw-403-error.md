# Using insufficient permissions to make API requests now throws an HTTP 403 errorBreaking changes

## What’s new

Returns the status code 403 when an API request is made with insufficient
permission. Previously, the API returned a 401 status code.

## Impact

The API now returns a 403 status code for insufficient permissions instead of
401, providing more accurate error information.
