# One-time payments in Checkout Sessions support no-cost ordersBreaking changes

## What’s new

[No-cost orders](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/no-cost-orders) are
now enabled for one-time payments in Checkout Sessions, changing the value of
`payment_method_collection` from `always` to `if_required`.

## Impact

This change simplifies the checkout process for free items or zero-cost
transactions, potentially reducing friction for scenarios like free trials or
promotional offerings.
