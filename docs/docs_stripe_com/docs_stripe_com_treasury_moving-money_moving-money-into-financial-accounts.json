In some scenarios, you can reverse `ReceivedCredits`,\nwhich creates a [CreditReversal\nobject](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/credit_reversals/object). For more\ninformation, see the [Moving money with Treasury using CreditReversal objects\nguide](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/financial-accounts/into/credit-reversals).\n\nStripe Treasury also provides test mode objects to facilitate testing money\nflows into financial accounts. The test mode endpoint for creating a\n`ReceivedCredit`, for example, enables you to add money to your test mode\nfinancial account balance to begin experimenting with other money movement\ncapabilities. The test mode endpoints for `InboundTransfers`, on the other hand,\nenable you to test effects of your other business logic when an\n`InboundTransfer` object transitions to a particular state.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Moving money with Treasury using InboundTransfer\nobjects](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/financial-accounts/into/inbound-transfers)\n- [Moving money with Treasury using ReceivedCredit\nobjects](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/financial-accounts/into/received-credits)\n- [Moving money with Treasury using CreditReversal\nobjects](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/financial-accounts/into/credit-reversals)\n\n## Links\n\n- [CreditReversal\nobject](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/credit_reversals/object)\n- [Moving money with Treasury using CreditReversal objects\nguide](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/financial-accounts/into/credit-reversals)\n- [Moving money with Treasury using InboundTransfer\nobjects](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/financial-accounts/into/inbound-transfers)\n- [Moving money with Treasury using ReceivedCredit\nobjects](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/financial-accounts/into/received-credits)",
