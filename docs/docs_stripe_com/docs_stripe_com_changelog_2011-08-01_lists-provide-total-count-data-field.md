# Lists now provide a total count of items and a data fieldBreaking changes

## What’s new

Updates the list format. New list objects have a `data` property that represents
an array of objects (by default, 10) and a `count` property that represents the
total count.

## Impact

The new list format with `data` and `count` properties provides clearer
pagination and total count information.
