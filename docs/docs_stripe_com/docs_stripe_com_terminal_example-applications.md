# Example applications

## Try Stripe Terminal by using the example applications and simulated reader.

#### Note

For a more immersive guide, check out the [sample
integration](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/quickstart).

A Stripe Terminal integration starts with your point of sale application running
at a physical location. Your point of sale application communicates with a
reader through the Terminal SDK to collect in-person payments from your
customers. Your backend works with your point of sale application to
authenticate the Terminal SDK and finalize payments.

!

Before starting your own integration, we recommend setting up one of the
Terminal example applications. This will give you a better feel for how the
components of a Terminal integration fit together and show you the interactions
between the SDK, the reader, your point of sale application, and your backend
code.

[Deploy the example
backend](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/example-applications#set-up-backend)
To get started with the example applications, set up the Sinatra-based [example
backend](https://github.com/stripe/example-terminal-backend) by following the
instructions in the
[README](https://github.com/stripe/example-terminal-backend). You can either run
the backend locally or deploy it to Render with a free account. The example
backend works with the example application to authenticate the Terminal SDK and
finalize payments.

[Run the example
application](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/example-applications#run-example-app)
Build and run one of the example applications:

JavaScriptiOSAndroidReact Native- Clone the example from
[GitHub](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-terminal-js-demo):

```
git clone https://github.com/stripe/stripe-terminal-js-demo.git
```

- Run the following commands to run the example:

```
cd stripe-terminal-js-demo
npm install
npm run start
```

- In the running example, enter the URL of the example backend that you deployed
in [step
1](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/example-applications#set-up-backend).
[Connect to a simulated
reader](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/example-applications#connect-simulated-reader)JavaScriptiOSAndroidReact
Native
After you have the example running, select **Use simulator** to connect to a
[simulated
reader](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/references/testing#simulated-reader).

The JavaScript example app connected to a simulated reader

The simulated reader handles events just like a physical reader, so you can
continue to collecting your first payment.

The simulated reader functionality is built into the SDK, so you can use it to
develop and test your own point of sale application without connecting to a
physical device.

[Collect your first
payment](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/example-applications#collect-payment)
Collect your first payment using the example application and a simulated reader.
Each of the examples features an event log for you to reference as you integrate
Terminal in your own application. As you collect your first payment, youâ€™ll see
the following sequence:

- **Create payment**: The example application collects a payment method using
the SDK.
- **Collect payment method**: The simulated reader receives a card.
- **Process and capture**: The example application and backend finalize the
payment.

#### Note

(Optional) Use [separate authorization and
capture](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/place-a-hold-on-a-payment-method) to
add a reconciliation step before finalizing the transaction. You can also
[automatically
capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-capture_method)
Terminal transactions.
