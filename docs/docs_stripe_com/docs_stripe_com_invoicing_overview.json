  "content": "# How invoicing works\n\n## Learn about the stages of the invoice lifecycle.\n\nInvoices provide an itemized list of goods and services rendered, which includes\nthe cost, quantity, and taxes. You can send invoices to customers to collect\npayment or you can create an invoice and automatically charge a customer’s saved\npayment method.\n[Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating)\nautomatically generate invoices for each billing cycle. Learn more about the\n[invoice lifecycle for\nsubscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview#invoice-lifecycle).\n\nWhen you create an invoice, you can select an existing\n[customer](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/customer) and\n[product](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/products-prices) or create and save\nnew ones. You can also create one-time products that only exist on the current\ninvoice.\n\nYou can use both the [Dashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/dashboard)\nand the [API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices) to create, edit, and manage\ninvoices.\n\n## Invoice lifecycle\n\nAfter they’re created manually or as part of a subscription, invoices move\nthrough a series of statuses as they’re created and processed. Stripe calls this\nthe automatic collection workflow.\n\nThe basic lifecycle for invoices looks like this:\n\n- A newly created invoice has `draft` status.\n- Stripe [finalizes an\ninvoice](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/workflow-transitions#finalized)\nwhen it’s ready to be paid by changing its status to `open`. You can no longer\nchange most details of a finalized invoice.\n- Stripe can wait for the customer to pay the invoice or automatically attempt\nto pay it using the customer’s default payment method.- If payment succeeds,\nStripe updates the invoice status to `paid`.\n- If payment fails, the invoice remains `open`.\n- Optionally, you can change the status of an unpaid invoice to `void` or\n`uncollectible`.\n\nYou can [configure Stripe to send customer\nemails](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/send-email) at different stages of the\ninvoice lifecycle, such as when it finalizes an invoice or when automatic\npayment fails.\n\n## Invoice statuses\n\nInvoices can have one of five statuses. The actions you can take on an invoice\ndepend on its status.\n\nStatusDescriptionPossible\nActions[draft](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/overview#draft)The invoice\nisn’t ready to use. All invoices start in `draft` status.- Edit any part of the\ninvoice.\n- When the invoice is ready to use, finalize it by changing its status to\n`open`.\n- If the invoice isn’t associated with a subscription,\n[delete](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/overview#deleted) it.\n[open](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/overview#open)The invoice is finalized\nand awaiting payment.- Send the invoice to a customer for payment.\n- Change [only some elements of the\ninvoice](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/invoice-edits). To make more\nsubstantive changes, create a new invoice and void the old one.\n- Change the invoice’s status to `paid`, `void`, or `uncollectible`.\n[paid](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/overview#paid)This invoice is paid.- No\nfurther actions.\n[void](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/overview#void)This invoice is\ncanceled.- No further actions.\n[uncollectible](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/overview#uncollectible)The\ncustomer is unlikely to pay the invoice. Normally, you treat it as bad debt in\nyour accounting process.- Change the invoice’s status to `void` or `paid`.\n\n### Draft invoices\n\nYou can update almost any details of a `draft` invoice. You can also delete it,\nunless it’s associated with a subscription. When a `draft` invoice is ready to\nsend for payment, you finalize it by changing its status to `open`.\n\nYou can delete a `draft` invoice. You can’t recover a deleted invoice.\n\nDashboardAPI- Go to the [Invoices\npage](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/invoices).\n- Click the overflow menu () next to the invoice.\n- Click **Delete draft**.\n\n### Open invoices\n\nThe invoice has been finalized and is awaiting customer payment. If its amount\ndue is less than the [minimum chargeable\namount](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts),\nit automatically transitions to `paid` status and Stripe debits the amount from\nthe [customer’s credit\nbalance](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance).\n\nIn the Dashboard, invoices in `open` status can display a different badge, such\nas `Past due` or `Retrying`. In some scenarios, you can hover over the badge to\nview an explanatory tooltip.\n\nIf an open non-subscription invoice is waiting for a payment that’s initiated\nbut still pending, it shows the `Pending` badge in the list of invoices.\nHowever, its details page shows the `Open` badge.\n\nYou can update only a few elements of an open invoice, such as the memo or\nmetadata. To make more substantive changes, you must [revise the\ninvoice](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/invoice-edits) by replacing it with a\nnew one.\n\nYou can’t delete a finalized invoice. To cancel it, change its status to `void`.\n\n### Paid invoices\n\nThe customer has paid the invoice. This status is terminal, which means that the\ninvoice’s status can never change.\n\nDashboardAPI\nTo attempt a payment through the Dashboard, open the [Invoice details\npage](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/dashboard/manage-invoices#invoice-details-page)\nand click **Charge customer**.\n\n#### Out of band invoices\n\nIf a customer pays an invoice out of band (outside of Stripe), you can manually\nchange the [status](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/overview#invoice-statuses)\nto `paid` through the Dashboard or API.\n\nDashboardAPI\nYou can manually mark an open invoice as paid in the Dashboard. On the invoice\ndetails page, click the overflow menu () and select **Change invoice status**.\nIn the **Change invoice status** dialog, select **Paid**.\n\n### Void invoices\n\nVoiding an invoice is conceptually similar to deleting or canceling it. However,\nvoiding an invoice maintains a paper trail, which allows you to look up the\ninvoice by number. Voided invoices are treated as zero-value for reporting\npurposes, and aren’t payable. This status is terminal, which means that the\ninvoice’s status can never change.\n\nAfter you void an invoice, the [Hosted Invoice\nPage](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/hosted-invoice-page) is still\naccessible, and displays a message indicating that the invoice has been voided.\nYou can only void an invoice in `open` or `uncollectible` status.\n\n#### Note\n\nConsult with local regulations to determine whether and how an invoice might be\namended, canceled, or voided in the jurisdiction you’re doing business in. You\nmight need to [issue another\ninvoice](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration#create-invoice-code) or\n[credit\nnote](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/programmatic-credit-notes)\ninstead. Stripe recommends that you consult with your legal counsel for advice\nspecific to your business.\n\nDashboardAPI\nTo void an invoice from the Dashboard:\n\n- Go to the **Invoice details** page.\n- Click the overflow menu () and select **Change invoice status**.\n- In the resulting dialog, select **Void**.\n\n### Uncollectible invoices\n\nSometimes your customers can’t pay their outstanding bills. For example, assume\nthat you provide 1,000 USD worth of services to your customer, but they’ve since\ndeclared bankruptcy and have no assets to pay the invoice.\n\nAs a result, you decide to write off the invoice as unlikely to be paid. In this\ncase, you can update the status of the invoice to be `uncollectible`. This\nallows you to track the amount owed for reporting purposes as part of your bad\ndebt accounting process.\n\nDashboardAPI\nYou can mark an open invoice as uncollectible in the Dashboard. On the invoice\ndetails page, click the overflow menu () and select **Change invoice status**.\nIn the **Change invoice status** dialog, select **Uncollectible**.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Use the Dashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/dashboard)\n- [Integrate with the API](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration)\n- [Status transitions and\nfinalization](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/workflow-transitions)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating)\n- [invoice lifecycle for\nsubscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview#invoice-lifecycle)\n- [customer](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/customer)\n- [product](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/products-prices)\n- [Dashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/dashboard)\n- [API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n- [finalizes an\ninvoice](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/workflow-transitions#finalized)\n- [configure Stripe to send customer\nemails](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/send-email)\n- [only some elements of the\ninvoice](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/invoice-edits)\n- [Invoices page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/invoices)\n- [minimum chargeable\namount](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts)\n- [customer’s credit balance](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance)\n- [Invoice details\npage](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/dashboard/manage-invoices#invoice-details-page)\n- [Hosted Invoice Page](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/hosted-invoice-page)\n- [issue another\ninvoice](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration#create-invoice-code)\n- [credit\nnote](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/programmatic-credit-notes)\n- [Integrate with the API](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration)\n- [Status transitions and\nfinalization](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/workflow-transitions)",
