# Issue credit notes

## Use the Dashboard to adjust or refund finalized invoices with credit notes.

Credit notes are documents that decrease the amount of an `open` or `paid`
[invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices). The difference between issuing
a credit note and adjusting the amount of an invoice by [revising
it](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/invoice-edits) is that a credit note
doesn’t void and replace the original invoice. Some example scenarios where you
might use credit notes include:

- **You accidentally overbilled a customer**—You accidentally charged your
customer 110 USD instead of 100 USD because of a data entry mistake. Use a
credit note to give your customer a 10 USD credit for the overcharge.
- **You’re short on inventory**—You billed your customer for five items, but
when it’s time to ship them you realize you only have three items left in stock.
Use a credit note to refund your customer for the two items they didn’t receive.
- **Discounts**—You and your customer negotiate a discount on an invoice.
Instead of voiding the invoice and issuing a new one, you can use a credit note
to adjust the amount owed on the existing invoice.

A credit note reduces the amount due without recording any payment. However, if
a credit note reduces the balance of an `open` invoice to 0, the invoice status
changes to `paid`. For information on invoice statuses, see the [Invoicing
overview](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/overview#invoice-statuses).

#### Note

For information about working with credit notes using the API, see [Generate
credit notes
programmatically](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/programmatic-credit-notes).

## Get started

When you issue a credit note for an `open` invoice, it decreases the amount due
on the invoice. When you issue a credit note for a `paid` invoice, you credit
the customer’s account balance or give them a refund outside of Stripe.

The sum of all credit notes issued for an invoice can’t exceed the ​​total
amount of the invoice. For a `paid` invoice, the sum of the refund, credit, and
out-of-band payment amounts must equal the credit note total.

When you create a credit note, you can apply credit amounts in three ways:

- Discount a fixed amount from an invoice line item.
- Discount a quantity from an invoice line item. The total discount is the
discount quantity times the unit price of that line item.
- Apply a discount to the total invoice amount by adding a custom discount line
item with a description, quantity, and unit price. The total discount is the
quantity times the unit price.

We recommend discounting invoice line items when possible, since it associates
each credit with a line item. Adding a custom discount line item can make
reporting and tracking difficult, because the credit isn’t associated with a
real invoice line item.

#### Note

You can’t combine discount types on an invoice line item. For example, if you
discount a line item quantity, then a future credit note can only discount that
line item by quantity, not by amount. If you discount a line item amount, then a
future credit note can only discount that line item by amount, not by quantity.

## Create a credit note

You can create credit notes for open or paid invoices.

- Open the [Invoices page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/invoices) in the
Dashboard.
- Select the open or paid invoice you want to add a credit note to.
- Click **More** and select **Issue a credit note**.
- Select a reason for the credit note.
- (*Optional*) Perform the following actions:

- Edit line item credit quantities or amounts.
- Click **Add item** to add a custom line item.
- Click **Set item tax** to select a tax rate to use for credit purposes.
- If the invoice is `paid`, choose whether to refund the customer’s card, credit
their balance, or refund the amount outside of Stripe (for example, cash).
- Click **Issue credit note** to submit the credit note.

#### Note

Open invoices can’t have a credit note with a pending
[payment_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-payment_intent).

## Credit balances and discounts

When you issue a credit note on an invoice with an applied [customer credit
balance](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/customer/balance), funds are
sometimes credited to the credit balance instead of the initial payment method.
For example, if a credit balance of 150 USD is applied to an invoice for 200
USD, then the finalized invoice is for 50 USD. If you issue a credit note for 50
USD or less, the funds are refunded to the customer’s payment method. Anything
above 50 USD is added to the customer’s credit balance and is applied to the
next invoice.

[Discounts](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/taxes/tax-rates#discounts) apply
proportionally to all of the line items on an invoice. For example, applying a
50% discount to an invoice with 10 line items at 10 USD each changes the amount
of each line item to 5 USD. If you then apply a credit note for one line item,
it reduces the invoice amount by 5 USD.

Fixed-amount discounts work the same way. If you apply a 10 USD discount to an
invoice with 10 line items at 10 USD, each line item is 10% of the sum amount
and is discounted by 10% * 10 USD = 1 USD. The amount of each line item becomes
9 USD. If you then apply a credit note for one line item, it reduces the invoice
amount by 9 USD.

If you want to credit the original line item amount, you can make up the
difference by adding a custom discount line item to the credit note. For
example, if a discount reduced a line item’s credit amount from 10 USD to 9 USD,
you can add a custom discount line item for 1 USD.

## Voiding credit notes

You can void a credit note only if it’s on an open invoice. Voiding a credit
note reverses its adjustment, increasing the amount due on the invoice by the
amount of the credit note.

To void a credit note in the Dashboard, click the overflow menu () at the top
right of the credit note, then select **Void credit note**.

## Crediting negative line items

You can also credit negative invoice line items.

The following restrictions apply:

- The total amount of the credit note must remain positive.
- The total amount credited to a negative line item must be negative.
- The total amount credited to a negative line item can’t be less than the line
item amount.

You also can’t credit a negative amount on a custom credit note line item. We
only support negative amounts on credit note line items that are tied to invoice
line items.
