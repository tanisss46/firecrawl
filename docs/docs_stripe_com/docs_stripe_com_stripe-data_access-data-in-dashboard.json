  "content": "# Create custom reports\n\n## Use Sigma to generate custom reports for charges, refunds, disputes, and more.\n\n[Sigma](https://dashboard.stripe.com/sigma/queries) makes all your transactional\ndata available within an interactive SQL environment in the Stripe Dashboard. It\nlets you create fully customized\n[reports](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-reports) using information about your\npayments, subscriptions, customers, payouts, and so on.\n\nWith Sigma, you can:\n\n- Get information that best reflects your business and Stripe integration.\n- Export in CSV format to import into your tools.\n- Fetch data on a schedule of your choosing.\n\n## Create a custom report\n\nReports give you the data required for your accounting and reconciliation\nworkflows. To create a report, query the assistant or write your own report with\nSQL. The reports you generate can differ from those you generate on the Stripe\nDashboard in the following ways:\n\n- **Data availability:** For financial reports, you can find the most recent day\nof available data by selecting **month to date** or opening the date picker\ncalendar. In Sigma, the `data_load_time` parameter provides the timestamp that\ndata is available through.\n- **Time zone:** Financial reports in the Stripe Dashboard filter reports by the\nlocal time zone by default, but you can switch them to use the UTC time zone.\nSigma filters templates by the UTC time zone.\n- **Date range:** A selected date range for Stripe Dashboard financial reports,\nsuch as Jan. 13 to Jan. 14, filters reports from January 13 00:00:00 up to\nJanuary 14 23:59:59. A chosen date range filter for Sigma templates for January\n13 to January 14 filters reports from Jan 13 00:00:00 up to January 13 23:59:59.\n- **Currency:** Financial reports in the Stripe Dashboard always filter data to\na single currency. By default, the Sigma report templates return all currencies.\nYou can add a `WHERE` clause to your Sigma query to restrict your results to a\nsingle currency.\n- **Metadata:** Financial reports allow you to include metadata. Sigma templates\ndon’t include it. You can add metadata to your reports by following the\n`Metadata to column` Sigma template.\n\nReports follow the same availability rules as the Stripe Dashboard. Payout\nReconciliation reports are only available for users with the **Automatic\npayouts** setting enabled, and connect variants of reports are only available\nfor users on [Stripe Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect).\n\n### Report templates\n\nYou can also create a report using a\n[template](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data/write-queries#templates). By\ndefault, these reports run on the last completed month that all data is\navailable for. To change the dates, make a copy of the template and edit the\nreport date intervals. Use the listed templates to generate their related\nreports and their connected variants:\n\nReport groupSigma template nameAPI report typeBalance report Itemized balance\nchange from activity`balance_change_from_activity.itemized.3`Itemized\npayouts`payouts.itemized.3`Payout reconciliation report Itemized payout\nreconciliation`payout_reconciliation.itemized.5`Itemized ending balance\nreconciliation`ending_balance_reconciliation.itemized.4`\n## Create and manage metrics\n\nCreate metrics from your Sigma reports and organize them in [metric\ngroups](https://dashboard.stripe.com/custom-metrics) to monitor your most\nimportant metrics daily. Edit the [Sigma\nchart](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data/write-queries#view-download-query-results)\non your metric to customize the metric preview. Metric groups that don’t have a\nchart enabled display the number of rows in the report.\n\n![Demonstrates Sigma custom report\ngroups](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/custom-reports.537d49b1fa1765a58d7237cf251d4a01.png)\n\nYou can create up to 50 metric groups for your account, with up to 12 Sigma\nreports in each metric group. Only the author of the metric group can edit or\ndelete the metric group. If you delete a metric group, it doesn’t impact the\nreports in that group.\n\n## Unsubscribing from Sigma\n\nIf you currently have an active Sigma subscription and want to cancel it, go to\nyour [Sigma settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/sigma) and click\n**Cancel Stripe Sigma subscription**. You can continue using Sigma until the end\nof the billing cycle, at which point the subscription ends.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Query transaction\ndata](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data/query-transactions)\n- [Query Billing data](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data/query-billing-data)\n- [Sigma and Data Pipeline for Connect\nplatforms](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data/query-connect-data)\n- [Query Issuing data](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data/query-issuing-data)\n- [Query all fees data](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data/query-all-fees-data)\n- [Schedule queries with\nSigma](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data/schedule-queries)\n- [Migrate queries onto the new Sigma\nversion](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data/migrate-queries)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Sigma](https://dashboard.stripe.com/sigma/queries)\n- [reports](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-reports)\n- [Stripe Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)\n- [template](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data/write-queries#templates)\n- [metric groups](https://dashboard.stripe.com/custom-metrics)\n- [Sigma\nchart](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data/write-queries#view-download-query-results)\n- [Sigma settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/sigma)\n- [Query transaction\ndata](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data/query-transactions)\n- [Query Billing data](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data/query-billing-data)\n- [Sigma and Data Pipeline for Connect\nplatforms](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data/query-connect-data)\n- [Query Issuing data](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data/query-issuing-data)\n- [Query all fees data](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data/query-all-fees-data)\n- [Schedule queries with\nSigma](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data/schedule-queries)\n- [Migrate queries onto the new Sigma\nversion](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data/migrate-queries)",
