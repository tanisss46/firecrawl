You must pay out the funds within the time period specified below,\nbased on the business’s country:\n\nCountryHolding PeriodThailand10 daysUnited States2 yearsAll other countries90\ndays\nTo trigger a payout of these funds, use the [Payouts\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payouts/create).\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts/{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}} \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d \"settings[payouts][schedule][interval]\"=manual\n```\n\nThe Payouts API is only for moving funds from a connected Stripe account’s\nbalance into their external account. To move funds between the platform and a\nconnected account, see creating [separate charges and\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers) or\ncreating [destination\ncharges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges) through the\nplatform.\n\n#### Note\n\n*Escrow* has a precise legal definition, and Stripe doesn’t provide escrow\nservices or support escrow accounts. However, you can control payout timing\nthrough manual payouts, which allow you to delay payouts to certain accounts.\nWhen using manual payouts, you must pay out funds within the time frame for the\nbusiness’s country.\n\nDelayed payouts can be useful when a delivery is delayed or when there’s a\npossibility of a refund.\n\n## Regular payouts\n\nThe following example sends 10 USD from a connected account’s Stripe balance to\ntheir external account:\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payouts \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -H \"Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}\" \\\n -d amount=1000 \\\n -d currency=usd\n```\n\nWith a standard payout, you can move an amount up to the user’s available\nbalance. To find that amount, perform a [retrieve\nbalance](https://docs.stripe.com/api#retrieve_balance) call on their behalf.\n\nStripe tracks balance contributions from different payment sources in separate\nbalances. The retrieve balance response breaks down the components of each\nbalance by source type. For example, to create a payout specifically for a\nnon-credit-card balance, specify the `source_type` in your request.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payouts \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -H \"Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}\" \\\n -d amount=24784 \\\n -d currency=usd \\\n -d source_type=bank_account\n```\n\nWhile individual balance components can go negative (such as through refunds or\nchargebacks), you can’t create payouts for greater than the aggregate available\nbalance.\n\n## Links\n\n-\n[schedule.interval](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-settings-payouts-schedule)\n- [Payouts API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payouts/create)\n- [separate charges and\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n- [destination charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges)\n- [retrieve balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api#retrieve_balance)",
