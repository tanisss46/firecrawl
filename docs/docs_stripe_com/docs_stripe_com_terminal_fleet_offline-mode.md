# Configure offline mode

## Enable or disable offline mode on your readers.

When youâ€™re operating with intermittent, limited, or no network connectivity,
Stripe Terminal allows you to store payments locally on [your POS
device](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/operate-offline/overview).
When a network connection is restored, the SDK automatically forwards any stored
payments to Stripe.

You can configure offline mode in the Dashboard or in the Configuration API.

DashboardAPI
To enable (or disable) offline mode, navigate to the relevant configuration you
