  "content": "# Issuing watchlist\n\n## Learn about the Issuing watchlist process and best practices.\n\nStripe automatically screens Issuing users against US and international\nsanctions lists. For Issuing, we screen all relevant data. Screening can occur\nbased on events such as:\n\n- Onboarding\n- Updates to sanction lists\n- Creation or update of cardholders\n\nIf automated screening flags a user, Stripe opens a manual review for them. Our\nteam reviews any flagged cardholders, and updates information about these\ncardholders within 24 hours. During the review, this process might impact your\nbusiness, and all cards decline authorizations with the\n`cardholder_verification_required` reason.\n\n## Integrating with watchlist events\n\nMake sure your integration listens to the\n[issuing_cardholder.updated](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-issuing_cardholder.updated)\n[webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) events. This is how we notify you\nwhen an interesting event occurs.\n\n- When a user creates or updates a cardholder, Stripe updates the\n[requirements.disabled_reason](https://docs.stripe.com/api/#issuing_cardholder_object-requirements-disabled_reason)\nto `under_review`. This notifies the user that a screening is underway.\n\n```\n\"requirements\": {\n \"disabled_reason\": \"under_review\",\n \"past_due\": []\n}\n```\n- In most cases, we clear the cardholder in a few seconds through our automated\nreview system.\n\n```\n\"requirements\": {\n \"disabled_reason\": null,\n \"past_due\": []\n}\n```\n- If a cardholder might be on a prohibited persons or companies list, we update\nthe\n[requirements.disabled_reason](https://docs.stripe.com/api/#issuing_cardholder_object-requirements-disabled_reason)\nto `listed`. The `past_due` field contains information you need to provide\nbefore the cardholder can approve authorizations.\n\n```\n\"requirements\": {\n \"disabled_reason\": \"listed\",\n \"past_due\": [\n \"individual.dob.day\",\n \"individual.dob.month\",\n \"individual.dob.year\"\n ]\n}\n```\n\nIn the Dashboard under [Issuing](https://dashboard.stripe.com/issuing/overview)\n> [Cardholders](https://dashboard.stripe.com/issuing/cardholders), a banner\nappears at the top of the page reflecting the information in the\n[requirements.disabled_reason](https://docs.stripe.com/api/#issuing_cardholder_object-requirements-disabled_reason)\nattribute noted above.\n\n!\n\nStripe also sends an email notification to you to provide more information to\nexpedite the verification process. Its a good practice, to monitor the email\nthat you have on file with Stripe.\n\n!\n- Stripe might reject the Cardholder if the user is on a third-party prohibited\npersons or companies list (such as a financial services provider or a government\nentity). We update the\n[requirements.disabled_reason](https://docs.stripe.com/api/#issuing_cardholder_object-requirements-disabled_reason)\nto `rejected.listed`. Additionally, the\n[status](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cardholders/object#issuing_cardholder_object-status)\nwill be `blocked`.\n\n```\n\"requirements\": {\n \"disabled_reason\": \"rejected.listed\",\n \"past_due\": []\n},\n\"status\": \"blocked\",\n\"type\": \"individual\"\n```\n\n## Best practices\n\n- Provide the date of birth when creating cardholders. When our systems raise\nreviews on Issuing Cardholders without a date of birth, analysts must contact\nthe Issuing platform or the cardholder to obtain this information.\n- For Issuing cardholders, you can order an optional physical card. Be aware\nthat we only ship a physical card after completing the watchlist screening\nprocess at onboarding and determining that it doesnâ€™t hit the watchlist.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Issuing: Watchlist reviews\nsupport](https://support.stripe.com/questions/issuing-watchlist-reviews)\n\n## Links\n\n-\n[issuing_cardholder.updated](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-issuing_cardholder.updated)\n- [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks)\n-\n[requirements.disabled_reason](https://docs.stripe.com/api/#issuing_cardholder_object-requirements-disabled_reason)\n- [Issuing](https://dashboard.stripe.com/issuing/overview)\n- [Cardholders](https://dashboard.stripe.com/issuing/cardholders)\n-\n[status](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cardholders/object#issuing_cardholder_object-status)\n- [Issuing: Watchlist reviews\nsupport](https://support.stripe.com/questions/issuing-watchlist-reviews)",
