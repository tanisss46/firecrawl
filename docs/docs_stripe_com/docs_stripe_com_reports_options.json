  "content": "# Report filters and settings\n\n## Understand the settings and controls that are common across all financial reports.\n\nThis page describes the set of options available on each financial report. These\ninclude filters to select the data to view, including [date\nrange](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/options#date-range),\n[currency](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/options#currency), and [connect\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/options#connect-accounts).\n\n## Date range\n\nWhen loading the page, the reports default to displaying data for the prior\nmonth. You can select previous months, current month-to-date, or customize the\ndate range to specific dates. Selected dates are inclusive. For example, if you\nchoose a date range of February 7, 2025–February 14, 2025, it includes data from\nthe beginning of the day on February 7, 2025 (12:00am) through the end of the\nday on February 14, 2025 (11:59pm) in the selected time zone.\n\n### Time zone customization\n\nYou can view financial reports based on either your Stripe account’s time zone\nor Coordinated Universal time (UTC). This selection affects both how the date\nrange setting filters the report, and how dates and times contained within the\nreport are presented.\n\n### Data availability\n\nStripe computes all your data on a daily basis beginning at 12:00am UTC. The\ndata for each day is defined as account activity that takes place between\n12:00am UTC and 11:59pm UTC.\n\nFinancial reports tabProcessing timeBalanceWithin 12 hoursPayout\nreconciliationWithin 12 hours\n#### Caution\n\nSLAs indicate when the reports are available for download. Webhook notifications\nmight take additional time.\n\nFor example, all account activity on February 7, 2025 (from 12:00 am to 11:59 pm\nUTC) is available in the **Balance financial reports** tab by February 8, 2025\nat 12:00 pm UTC.\n\nUsers who view reports in certain non-UTC timezones might experience an\nadditional day delay. For example, the Balance report for Monday won’t become\navailable until Wednesday morning when viewed in the America/Los_Angeles\ntimezone (PST). This is because data is processed by UTC day, and the last few\nhours of Monday in PST correspond to Tuesday morning in UTC. As such, the report\ncan’t be made available until Tuesday’s data has finished processing, which\noccurs by Wednesday at 12:00 pm UTC.\n\n## Currency\n\nFinancial reports are based on your account’s [settlement\ncurrency](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/payouts-connected-accounts#supported-settlement),\nwhich is the currency Stripe uses to send\n[payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts) to your bank.\n\nIf your account has multiple settlement currencies, you can view reports for\neach currency separately using the currency selector.\n\n## Connect accounts\n\n[Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect) platforms often need visibility into\nfunds and transactions within their connected accounts in addition to their\nplatform activity. When viewing a report as the platform account, you can toggle\nbetween viewing data:\n\n- For the platform account only\n- For all of the platform’s connected accounts (summary reports sum the data\nacross all connected accounts, while itemized reports include relevant rows for\nall connected accounts)\n- For a single connected account\n\nTo view reporting for a single connected account:\n\n- Go to the [Connect\nAccounts](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/accounts/overview) page and\nsearch for the account you want.\n- Click on the account’s name to go to the account detail page.\n- Click the **View financial reports** link under the Reports section.\n\n!\n\n#### Caution\n\nConnect platforms can’t view the financial reports for connected accounts that\ncan access the full Stripe Dashboard and aren’t [controlled by the\nplatform](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/platform-controls-for-stripe-dashboard-accounts).\nHolders of such accounts can independently control them if they were created\nwith Stripe directly. Those accounts can contain transactions that originate\noutside of your platform. Because they have access to the full Stripe Dashboard,\nthey can generate their own financial reports.\n\n## Scheduled reports\n\nTo set up a subscription schedule for reports and get notified of new data, read\nour [scheduled reports](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/scheduled-reports) docs.\n\n## Links\n\n- [settlement\ncurrency](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/payouts-connected-accounts#supported-settlement)\n- [payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts)\n- [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)\n- [Connect Accounts](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/accounts/overview)\n- [controlled by the\nplatform](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/platform-controls-for-stripe-dashboard-accounts)\n- [scheduled reports](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/scheduled-reports)",
