# API upgrades

## Keep track of changes and upgrades to the Stripe API.

Your API version controls the API and webhook behavior you see (for example,
what parameters you can include in requests, what properties you see in
responses, and so on). Your version gets set the first time you make an API
request. Each major release, such as
[Acacia](https://docs.stripe.com/changelog/acacia), includes changes that aren’t
backward-compatible with previous releases. Upgrading to a new major release can
require updates to existing code. Each monthly release includes only
backward-compatible changes, and uses the same name as the last major release.
You can safely upgrade to a new monthly release without breaking any existing
code. To upgrade your API version, follow [these
steps](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#how-can-i-upgrade-my-api).

When a [Connect](https://stripe.com/connect) platform makes requests on behalf
of connected accounts without specifying an API version, Stripe always uses the
platform’s API version. Regardless of a connected account’s API version, the
platform’s requests on its behalf always return responses matching the API
version of the request.

## Backward-compatible changes

Stripe considers the following changes to be backward-compatible:

- Adding new API resources.
- Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods.
- Adding new properties to existing API responses.
- Changing the order of properties in existing API responses.
- Changing the length or format of opaque strings, such as object IDs, error
messages, and other human-readable strings.- This includes adding or removing
fixed prefixes (such as `ch_` on charge IDs).
- Make sure that your integration can handle Stripe-generated object IDs, which
can contain up to 255 characters. For example, if you’re using MySQL, store the
IDs in a `VARCHAR(255) COLLATE utf8_bin` column (the `COLLATE` configuration
provides case-sensitivity during lookups).
- Adding new event types.- Make sure that your webhook listener gracefully
handles unfamiliar event types.

## Upgrade your API version

If you’re running an older version of the API, upgrade to the latest version to
take advantage of new features and enhanced functionality.

Upgrading your API version affects:

- The API calls you make without a `Stripe-Version` header: the parameters you
can send and the structure of objects returned.
- The structure of objects received with
[Stripe.js](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements) methods such as
[confirmCardPayment](https://docs.stripe.com/js#stripe-confirm-card-payment).
- The structure of objects sent to your webhook endpoints (both Account and
[Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/webhooks)). However, if an endpoint
has an explicit version set, it always uses that version.
- Automated Billing operations performed by Stripe (for example, generating an
[invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices) for a new subscription period)
use your account’s default API version. See the API changelog for details about
how your default API version impacts these operations.

### View your API version and the latest available upgrade in Workbench

See the [API version used by recent
requests](https://docs.stripe.com/workbench/guides#view-api-versions) on your
account and the latest available upgrade from the
[Overview](https://dashboard.stripe.com/workbench/overview) tab in Workbench.

When performing an API upgrade, make sure that you specify the API version that
you’re integrating against in your code instead of relying on your account’s
default API version. To test a newer version for API calls, set the
`Stripe-Version` header (in live or test mode). Learn how to manage versioning
in our [server-side SDKs](https://docs.stripe.com/sdks#server-side-libraries).

### Upgrade and test your webhooks

Read our guide on [how to handle webhook
versioning](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks/versioning).

### Perform the upgrade

When you’re confident that your code can handle the latest API version, perform
the upgrade using Workbench:

- Open the [Overview](https://dashboard.stripe.com/workbench/overview) tab in
Workbench.
- In the **API versions** section, click **Upgrade available**, which is visible
if a newer API version is available.
- Review which API version will be assigned to your account, and click
**Upgrade.**

This switches the version used by API calls that don’t have the `Stripe-Version`
header and also switches the version used to render objects sent to your
webhooks.

#### Caution

The shape of resources inside [events retrieved from the
API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events) is defined by the default API version
of your account at the time the event occurred. If your code retrieves events
created when your default API version was different, it must account for any
differences in the event versions.

### Roll back your API version

For 72 hours after you’ve upgraded your API version, you can safely roll back to
the version you were upgrading from in Workbench.

After you’ve rolled back, webhooks that were sent with the new object structure
and failed will be retried with the old structure.

Depending on the configuration of your card program, use `driver_id`,
`vehicle_number`, `unspecified_id` or `user_id` instead.
- In the Capabilities API, `paused.inactivity` and `other` have been added as
new disabled reasons. See [Capability disabled
reasons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#capability_object-requirements-disabled_reason)
for more information.
- In the Capabilities API, `bank_transfer_payments` capability type is being
deprecated in favor of newer capability types per buyer’s location. The newer

`automatic_async` as the default capture method when capture method is not
specified during PaymentIntents creation. For more information about async
capture, view the [asynchronous capture
guide](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents/asynchronous-capture).
- Fields under `rendering_options` for invoices are now migrated under
`rendering`.
- Product ‘features’ has been renamed to `marketing_features`.

### 2023-10-16

- In the Accounts API, the following error codes have been added as new error
codes in the `requirements.errors` array. See [Account requirements
errors](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-requirements-errors)
for more information.

- `invalid_address_highway_contract_box`
- `invalid_address_private_mailbox`
- `invalid_business_profile_name`
- `invalid_business_profile_name_denylisted`
- `invalid_company_name_denylisted`
- `invalid_dob_age_over_maximum`
- `invalid_dob_age_under_minimum`
- `invalid_product_description_length`
- `invalid_product_description_url_match`
- `invalid_statement_descriptor_business_mismatch`
- `invalid_statement_descriptor_denylisted`
- `invalid_statement_descriptor_length`
- `invalid_statement_descriptor_prefix_denylisted`
- `invalid_statement_descriptor_prefix_mismatch`
- `invalid_tax_id_format`
- `invalid_url_denylisted`
- `invalid_url_format`
- `invalid_url_web_presence_detected`
- `invalid_url_website_business_information_mismatch`
- `invalid_url_website_empty`

- `invalid_url_website_incomplete_return_policy`
- `invalid_url_website_incomplete_terms_and_conditions`
- `invalid_url_website_incomplete_under_construction`
- `invalid_url_website_other`
- In the Accounts API, if no `settings.payments.statement_descriptor` is
supplied, the statement descriptor is automatically set to the first supplied
parameter of (in priority order):

- `business_profile.name`
- `business_profile.url`
- `company.name` or `individual.first_name` + `individual.last_name` (dependent
on the `business_type`)

The statement descriptor is only set automatically when one of the above fields
is provided as a parameter, so existing accounts will not be impacted unless a
dependent field is updated. Similarly,
`settings.card_payments.statement_descriptor_prefix` will be defaulted to a
shortened version of the `settings.payments.statement_descriptor`. This will
take place whenever the statement descriptor is updated (either explicitly, or
when defaulted).

### 2023-08-16

- Major
[PaymentIntents](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents) and
[SetupIntents](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents) now have
`automatic_payment_methods` enabled by default, which allows you to configure
payment method settings from the
[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods)—no code
required. The previous default was to accept only card payments when both
`payment_method_types` and `automatic_payment_methods` were not specified. For
more information, view the [upgrade
guide](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades/manage-payment-methods).

- When confirming a PaymentIntent, you will be required to provide a
`return_url` unless `off_session=true`.
- When confirming a PaymentIntent, you cannot use `error_on_requires_action`.
Use `payment_method_types` with `error_on_requires_action` if you wish to fail
payment attempts when PaymentIntents transition into `requires_action`.
- When confirming a SetupIntent, you will be required to provide a `return_url`.
- You can bypass the `return_url` requirement using
`automatic_payment_methods[allow_redirects]=never`, this will automatically
filter payment methods that [require
redirect](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/integration-options#additional-api-supportability)
even if they are enabled in the Dashboard.
- [No-cost orders](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/no-cost-orders) are
now enabled for one-time payments in Checkout Sessions. The value of
`payment_method_collection` has changed from `always` to `if_required`
accordingly.
- When being viewed by a platform, PaymentMethod fingerprints of types
`us_bank_account`, `acss_debit`, `sepa_debit`, `bacs_debit`, and `au_becs_debit`
are rendered in platform scope, not the owning merchant (connected account)
scope. This works similarly to the
[2018-01-23](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#2018-01-23) change for cards and
bank accounts.
- Added more specific error codes to the
[PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents) API for when a
[Klarna](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/klarna) payment fails:

- `payment_method_customer_decline`
- `payment_method_not_available`
- `payment_method_provider_decline`
- `payment_intent_payment_attempt_expired`
- In the Accounts API, `verification_missing_directors`,
`verification_directors_mismatch`, `verification_document_directors_mismatch`
and `verification_extraneous_directors` has been added as a new error code in
the `requirements.errors` array. See [Account requirements
errors](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-requirements-errors)
for more information.

### 2022-11-15

- [Charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object) no longer auto-expands
refunds by default. You can [expand the
list](https://docs.stripe.com/api#expanding_objects) but for performance reasons
we recommended against doing so unless needed.
- The `charges` property on
[PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object) has been
removed. You can use the `latest_charge` property instead.
- Added more specific error codes for the following bank redirect payment
methods: Bancontact, EPS, Giropay, iDEAL, Przelewy24, and Sofort.

- Added the following error codes to the
[PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents) and
[PaymentMethod](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods) APIs:

- `payment_intent_payment_attempt_expired`
- `payment_method_customer_decline`
- `payment_method_provider_timeout`
- `payment_method_not_available`
- `payment_method_provider_decline`
- Added the following error codes to the
[SetupIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents) APIs:

- `setup_intent_setup_attempt_expired`
- `payment_method_customer_decline`
- `payment_method_provider_timeout`
- `payment_method_not_available`
- `payment_method_provider_decline`
- In the Accounts API, `verification_legal_entity_structure_mismatch` has been
added as a new error code in the `requirements.errors` array. See [Account
requirements
errors](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-requirements-errors)
for more information.

### 2022-08-01

- The `pending_invoice_items_behavior` parameter on [create
Invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create) no longer supports the
`include_and_require` value. When the parameter is omitted the default value of
`pending_invoice_items_behavior` is now `exclude`.
- When creating a Checkout Session in payment mode, the default value of
`customer_creation` has changed from `always` to `if_required`.
- A PaymentIntent is no longer created during Checkout Session creation in
payment mode. Instead, a PaymentIntent will be created when the Session is
confirmed.
- Checkout Sessions no longer return the `setup_intent` property in subscription
mode.
- The following parameters have been removed from [create Checkout
Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create):

- `line_items[amount]`
- `line_items[currency]`
- `line_items[name]`
- `line_items[description]`
- `line_items[images]`

You can use the `price` and `price_data` parameters instead.
- The `subscription_data[coupon]` parameter has been removed from [create
Checkout Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create). You can
use the `discounts` parameter instead.
- The `shipping_rates` parameter has been removed from [create Checkout
Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create). You can use the
`shipping_options` parameter instead.
- On the Checkout Session resource, several shipping properties have changed.

- `shipping_rate` has been moved into the new `shipping_cost` hash.
- `shipping` has been renamed to `shipping_details`.
- `exempted` now appears in the `three_d_secure` hash for card Charges. It
indicates that a 3D Secure exemption was granted.
- In the Accounts API, `invalid_tos_acceptance` has been added as a new error
code in the `requirements.errors` array. See [Account requirements
errors](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-requirements-errors)
for more information.
- When creating a `physical` Issuing card in testmode, its shipping
[status](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/object#issuing_card_object-shipping-status)
no longer automatically changes from `pending` to `delivered`. This
functionality is now accessible via the following new endpoints:

- `/v1/test_helpers/issuing/cards/:card/shipping/ship`
- `/v1/test_helpers/issuing/cards/:card/shipping/deliver`
- `/v1/test_helpers/issuing/cards/:card/shipping/return`
- `/v1/test_helpers/issuing/cards/:card/shipping/fail`
- `design_rejected` is now a possible value for the `cancellation_reason` field
on the issued card object, indicating that the card’s design was rejected by
Stripe.
- The `default_currency` field on the Customer API resource has been removed.

### 2020-08-27

- We have removed `tax_percent` from objects and requests in favor of [tax
rates](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_rates).
- On subscription schedules, `phases.plans` has been renamed to `phases.items`.
This applies for the [subscription
schedule](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscription_schedules/object#subscription_schedule_object-phases)
object as well as
[create](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscription_schedules/create#create_subscription_schedule-phases)
and
[update](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscription_schedules/update#update_subscription_schedule-phases)
requests.
- Deprecate the `payment_method.card_automatically_updated` webhook in favor of
`payment_method.automatically_updated`.
- Checkout Sessions no longer include the `display_items` property. Use the
includable `line_items` property instead.
- The `requirements` hash on the Account and Capability objects, and the
`verification_fields` hash on the Country Spec object have newly formatted
strings for requirements that are related to key persons associated with an
account:

- Fields that are required for persons with `representative`, `owner`,
`director`, and `executive` roles will be prefixed with `representative`,
`owners`, `directors`, and `executives`, respectively. Person requirements will
be previewed as follows:- When the representative’s phone number is required, it
will appear as `representative.phone` instead of `relationship.representative`.
- When an owner’s full name is required, it will appear as `owners.first_name`
and `owners.last_name` instead of `relationship.owner`.
- When an executive’s ID number is required, it will appear as
`executives.id_number` instead of `relationship.executive`.
- When a director’s date of birth is required, it will appear as
`directors.dob.day`, `directors.dob.month`, and `directors.dob.year` instead of
`relationship.director`.
- The boolean values that indicate the associated owners, executives, or
directors have been provided now appear as `company.owners_provided`,
`company.executives_provided`, or `company.directors_provided` instead of
`relationship.owner`, `relationship.executive`, or `relationship.director`,
respectively.
- In the Accounts/Persons/Capabilities API, several new error codes have been
introduced in the `requirements.errors` array. See [Account requirements
errors](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-requirements-errors)
for more information. These error codes are:

- `verification_document_issue_or_expiry_date_missing`
- `verification_document_not_signed`
- `verification_failed_tax_id_not_issued`
- `verification_failed_tax_id_match`
- `invalid_address_po_boxes_disallowed`
- The `payment_method_details.card.three_d_secure` fields on the Charge object
have been updated. The `succeeded` and `authenticated` booleans have been
removed; please use the `result` enum instead.
- The `subscriptions` property on Customers is no longer included by default.
You can [expand the list](https://stripe.com/docs/api#expanding_objects) but for
performance reasons we recommended against doing so unless needed.
- The `tiers` property on Plan is no longer included by default. You can [expand
the list](https://stripe.com/docs/api#expanding_objects) but for performance
reasons we recommended against doing so unless needed.
- The `sources` property on Customers is no longer included by default. You can
[expand the list](https://stripe.com/docs/api#expanding_objects) but for
performance reasons we recommended against doing so unless needed.
- The `tax_ids` property on Customers is no longer included by default. You can
[expand the list](https://stripe.com/docs/api#expanding_objects) but for
performance reasons we recommended against doing so unless needed.
- The `prorate` and `subscription_prorate` parameters are deprecated in favor of
`proration_behavior`.

### 2020-03-02

- Major
You can now optionally number invoices [sequentially across your
account](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/invoices/customizing#invoice-prefix-number)
instead of sequentially for each customer. To use this feature, enable [account
level numbering](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/invoice) in the
Stripe Dashboard.

- To ensure invoices are numbered sequentially and without gaps, invoices that
can be deleted (drafts) are only assigned numbers when finalized.

### 2019-12-03

- Major
The
[id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/line_item#invoice_line_item_object-id)
field of all invoice line items have changed and are now prefixed with `il_`.
The new id has consistent prefixes across all line items, is globally unique,
and can be used for pagination. Old prefixes included `sub_`, `su_`, `item_`,
`sli_`, and `ii_` and weren’t globally unique.

- You can no longer use the prefix of the id to determine the source of the line
item. Instead use the `type` field for this purpose.
- For lines with `type=invoiceitem`, use the `invoice_item` field to reference
or update the originating Invoice Item object.
- The Invoice Line Item object on earlier API versions also have a `unique_id`
field to be used for migrating internal references before upgrading to this
version.
- When [setting a tax rate to individual line
items](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/tax-rates#setting-tax-rates-on-individual-items),
use the new `id`. Users on earlier API versions can pass in either a line item
`id` or `unique_id`.
- When [creating](https://docs.stripe.com/api/credit_notes/create) a
post-payment credit note on an invoice:

-
[out_of_band_amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/credit_notes/create#create_credit_note-out_of_band_amount)
is required if the sum of `credit_amount` and (`refund` or `refund_amount`) is
less than the credit note total.
- In previous API versions `out_of_band_amount` is optional and, in the case
that the `credit_amount` and refund amounts are less than the credit note total,
the difference will automatically be allocated to the `out_of_band_amount`.
- Customer balances applied to all invoices are now debited or credited back to
the customer when voided. Earlier, applied customer balances were not returned
back to the customer and were consumed.

- To achieve this behavior in earlier API versions:- Set
`consume_applied_balance` to `false` when voiding invoices in
[/v1/invoices/:id/void](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/void).
- Set `invoice_customer_balance_settings[consume_applied_balance_on_void]` to
`false` in `/v1/subscriptions`
[create](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/create) or
[update](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/update) to force this
behavior for Invoices voided by a Subscription.
- Set
`subscription_data[invoice_customer_balance_settings][consume_applied_balance_on_void]`
to `false` in `/v1/checkout/sessions`
[create](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create) to force this
behavior for Invoices voided by Subscriptions created with Checkout.
- Deprecated tax information for Customers have been removed.

- The deprecated `tax_info` and `tax_info_verification` fields on the `Customer`
object are now removed in favor of `tax_ids`.
- The deprecated `tax_info` parameter on the `Customer` create and update
methods are removed in favor of `tax_id_data`.
- For more information, view the [migration
guide](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/taxes/tax-rates#migration).

### 2019-11-05

- In the Accounts API, the `requested_capabilities` property is now required at
creation time for Custom accounts in all countries. See [Account
capabilities](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities) for more
information.
- On subscription schedules, `invoice_settings`, `default_payment_method`,
`billing_thresholds` and `collection_method` are now nested under
`default_settings`.

### 2019-10-17

- There are changes to subscription schedules.

- Rename `renewal_behavior` to `end_behavior` with values `cancel` and
`release`.
- Remove `renewal_interval`.
- A side effect of this change is that if you wrote a `renewal_behavior` of
`none` on an old API version, `end_behavior` will be converted to `cancel` when
reading the value back.
- In the event that you are upgrading your API and set `renewal_behavior` as
`renew`, with this API version enabled you will see `end_behavior` as `renew`
however you will not be able to update `renewal_interval`. Additionally you can
not set `end_behavior` to `renew`, so it is in a read-only state.
- The `start` field on a subscription resource has been removed and is replaced
by a `start_date` field which represents when the entire subscription started as
opposed to when the current plan configuration started.
- The `due_date` property is always null on invoices with
`billing=charge_automatically`.
- The `billing` attribute on invoices, subscriptions, and subscription schedules
is renamed to `collection_method`.
- The [customer object](https://stripe.com/docs/api/customers)’s
`account_balance` value has been renamed to `balance`. A new [customer balance
transactions API](https://stripe.com/docs/api/customer_balance_transactions) is
available:

- Update the customer’s `balance` by incrementing or decrementing its current
value by a specified `amount` and attaching `metadata` to the change.
- Retrieve history of changes to the customer’s `balance`.

### 2019-10-08

- The `relationship[account_opener]` field on a Person object has been renamed
to `relationship[representative]`.

### 2019-09-09

- In the Accounts API, the `requested_capabilities` property is now required at
creation time for accounts in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland,
France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand,
Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. See
[Account capabilities](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities) for
more information.
- Adds additional `details_code` values to the `verification[document]` hash on
a Person object.

### 2019-08-14

- Major
The `platform_payments` capability has been renamed to `transfers`, to better
indicate the Stripe primitives that this capability supports.

- The `card_payments` capability has been updated to no longer imply
`transfers`. You’ll now need to additionally request the `transfers` capability
when creating an account.
- The `relationship[executive]` field on a Person object will no longer be
automatically set to `true` when a Person object with
`relationship[account_opener]` is created. The `requirements` hash on an Account
object may require that you explicitly indicate that the `account_opener` is
also an `executive`. If this is the case, you will need to indicate it by
setting `relationship[executive]=true`.

### 2019-05-16

- Bank pull payments no longer expose internal system refunds on failure.

System refunds can still be accessed via the [list
refunds](https://stripe.com/docs/api/refunds/list#list_refunds-charge) endpoint.

### 2019-03-14

- The `application_fee` parameter on invoice API methods and the
`application_fee` field on the invoice object have both been renamed to
`application_fee_amount`.
- Major
Creating a subscription succeeds even when the first payment fails. The
subscription will be created in an incomplete status, where it will remain for
up to 23 hours. During that time period, it can be moved into an active state by
paying the first invoice. If no successful payment is made, the subscription
will move into a final incomplete_expired state. Updates to a non-incomplete
subscription that require a payment will also succeed regardless of the payment
status. Prior to this version, all creations or updates would fail if the
corresponding payment failed. For more details see [our
guide](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/overview#subscription-lifecycle).
- There are a few changes to the [invoice
object](https://stripe.com/docs/api/invoices):

- A `status_transitions` hash now contains the timestamps when an invoice was
finalized, paid, marked uncollectible, or voided.
- The `date` property has been renamed to `created`.
- The `finalized_at` property has been moved into the `status_transitions` hash.

### 2019-02-19

- Major
Statement descriptor behaviors for card payments [created via
/v1/charges](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/create) have changed. See [our
statement descriptor
guide](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/charges-api#dynamic-statement-descriptor)
for details.

- Instead of using the platform’s statement descriptor, charges created with
`on_behalf_of` or `destination` will now use the descriptor of the connected
account.
- The full statement descriptor for a card payment may no longer be provided at
charge creation. Dynamic descriptors provided at charge time will now be
prefixed by the descriptor prefix set in the dashboard or via the new
`settings[card_payments][statement_descriptor_prefix]` parameter in the Accounts
API.
- If an account has no `statement_descriptor` set, the account’s business or
legal name will be used as statement descriptor.
- Statement descriptors may no longer contain `*`, `'`, and `"`.
- `legal_entity[business_id_number]` has been renamed
`legal_entity[business_registration_number]`.
- Major
Many properties on the Account API object have been reworked. To see a mapping
of the old argument names to the new ones, see [Accounts API Argument
Changes](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/updated-requirements/accounts-arguments).

- The `legal_entity` property on the Account API resource has been replaced with
`individual`, `company`, and `business_type`.
- The `verification` hash has been replaced with a `requirements` hash.- The
`verification[fields_needed]` array has been replaced with three arrays to
better represent when info is required: `requirements[eventually_due]`,
`requirements[currently_due]`, and `requirements[past_due]`.
- `verification[due_by]` has been renamed to `requirements[current_deadline]`.
- The `disabled_reason` enum value of `fields_needed` has been renamed to
`requirements.past_due`.
- Properties on the Account API object that configure behavior within Stripe
have been moved into the new `settings` hash.- The `payout_schedule`,
`payout_statement_descriptor` and `debit_negative_balances` fields have been
moved to `settings[payouts]` and renamed to `schedule`, `statement_descriptor`
and `debit_negative_balances`.
- The `statement_descriptor` field has been moved to
`settings[payments][statement_descriptor]`.
- The `decline_charge_on` fields have been moved to `settings[card_payments]`
and renamed to `decline_on`.
- The `business_logo`, `business_logo_large` and `business_primary_color` fields
have been moved to `settings[branding]` and renamed to `icon`, `logo` and
`primary_color`. The `icon` field additionally requires the uploaded image file
to be square.
- The `display_name` and `timezone` fields have been moved to
`settings[dashboard]`.
- `business_name`, `business_url`, `product_description`, `support_address`,
`support_email`, `support_phone` and `support_url` have been moved to the
`business_profile` subhash.
- The `legal_entity[verification][document]` property (now located at
`individual[verification]` and at `verification` in the Person API object) has
been changed to a hash.- The `front` and `back` fields support uploading both
sides of documents.
- The `details_code` field has new error types: `document_corrupt`,
`document_failed_copy`, `document_failed_greyscale`, `document_failed_other`,
`document_failed_test_mode`, `document_fraudulent`,
`document_id_country_not_supported`, `document_id_type_not_supported`,
`document_invalid`, `document_manipulated`, `document_missing_back`,
`document_missing_front`, `document_not_readable`, `document_not_uploaded`,
`document_photo_mismatch`, and `document_too_large`.
- The `keys` property on Account creation has been removed. Platforms should now
authenticate as their connected accounts with their own key via [the
Stripe-Account
header](https://stripe.com/docs/connect/authentication#stripe-account-header).
- Starting with the 2019-02-19 API, the `requested_capabilities` property is now
required at creation time for accounts in the U.S. See [Account
capabilities](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities) for more
information.

### 2019-02-11

- Some PaymentIntent statuses have been renamed

- `requires_source` is now `requires_payment_method`
- `requires_source_action` is now `requires_action`
- All other statuses are unchanged
- `save_source_to_customer` has been renamed to `save_payment_method`.
- `allowed_source_types` has been renamed to `payment_method_types`.
- The `next_source_action` property on PaymentIntent has been renamed to
`next_action`, and the `authorize_with_url` within has been renamed to
`redirect_to_url`.

### 2018-11-08

- The `closed` property on the [invoice
object](https://stripe.com/docs/api/invoices) controls [automatic
collection](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/workflow#auto_advance).
`closed` has been deprecated in favor of the more specific `auto_advance` field.
Where you might have set `closed=true` on invoices in the past, set
`auto_advance=false`.
- `auto_advance` now also defaults to false for one-off invoices, allowing you
to control how long their
[status](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/invoice-states#status) stays
a `draft`. A longer explanation of these series of changes is [in the
documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/invoice-states#autoadvance).
- Instead of checking the `forgiven` field on an invoice, check for the
`uncollectible` status.

- Instead of setting the `forgiven` field on an invoice, [mark it as
uncollectible.](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/mark_uncollectible)
- The `immutable_frozen_invoice` error code was renamed to
`invoice_already_finalized`
- The following changes only affect users of PaymentIntents as part of the
private beta before November 15, 2018. If you did not use PaymentIntents before
then, these don’t affect you.

- The `next_source_action` dictionary on PaymentIntents previously contained a
key called `value`. This has been replaced with the `authorize_with_url` and
`use_stripe_sdk` keys.
- When creating PaymentIntents, the `attempt_confirmation` parameter has been
renamed to `confirm`.
- The PaymentIntent confirm endpoint no longer supports the `payment_intent`
parameter. To update a PaymentIntent’s source, pass `source` or `source_data` as
a top-level parameter.
- The `return_url` parameter is only allowed when confirming a PaymentIntent.
Passing `return_url` when updating a PaymentIntent is no longer allowed.
- When creating a PaymentIntent with `transfer_data[destination]`, the
`on_behalf_of` parameter must be provided and must match the account provided to
`transfer_data[destination]`. This is because when you provide a destination,
Stripe will [settle charges in the country of the destination
account](https://stripe.com/docs/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers#settlement-merchant).
- The `next_source_action` dictionary on PaymentIntents no longer contains the
`source_type` property. To view the source type when retrieving PaymentIntents,
[expand](https://stripe.com/docs/api/expanding_objects) the `source` parameter.

### 2018-10-31

- The `description` field on customer endpoints has a maximum character length
limit of `350` now. The `name` field on product endpoints has a maximum
character length limit of `250` now. The `description` field on invoice line
items has a maximum character length limit of `500` now.
- The `billing_reason` attribute of the invoice object now can take the value of
`subscription_create`, indicating that it is the first invoice of a
subscription. For older API versions, `billing_reason=subscription_create` is
represented as `subscription_update`.

### 2018-09-24

- `FileUpload` objects have been renamed to `File` objects. Additionally, the
`url` attribute now contains an authenticated URL (i.e. you will need to use
your secret API key to download the file’s contents.) You can [create a file
link](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_file_link) to obtain a
publicly-accessible URL for the file.

### 2018-09-06

- When creating or updating a SKU, its attribute values no longer need to be
unique. It is now possible to create multiple SKUs without attributes or with
identical attribute values.

### 2018-08-23

- You can no longer set `at_period_end` in the subscription `DELETE` endpoints.
The `DELETE` endpoint is reserved for immediate canceling going forward. Use
`cancel_at_period_end` on the subscription update endpoints instead.
- The [customer object](https://stripe.com/docs/api/customers)’s
`business_vat_id` was changed from String to Hash called `tax_info`, consisting
of `tax_id` and `type`, in both requests and responses.
- The `amount` field field in the `tiers` configuration for `plans` was renamed
to `unit_amount`.

### 2018-07-27

- The subscription endpoints no longer support the `source` parameter. If you
want to change the default source for a customer, instead use the [source
creation API](https://stripe.com/docs/api#create_source) to add the new source
and then the [customer update API](https://stripe.com/docs/api#update_customer)
to set it as the default.
- When ending a trial on a subscription using `trial_end=now` the updated
subscription will now receive a `trial_end` timestamp from the time of the
request rather than being unset.
- The `percent_off` field of coupons was changed from Integer to Float, with a
precision of two decimal places.
- When creating or updating a customer the `email` parameter must contain an
email address of valid shape.

### 2018-05-21

- Products no longer have SKU lists embedded.
- Major
The `id` field of invoice line items of `type=subscription` no longer can be
interpreted as a subscription ID, but instead is a unique invoice line item ID.
It can be used for pagination.
- Coupon, SKU, customer, product and plan `id`s may only contain alphanumeric
and `_-` characters on creation.
- Major
When creating or updating subscriptions, the default value of `trial_from_plan`
is now `false`, meaning that a subscription will not automatically inherit a
plan’s `trial_period_days`. If a subscription is already trialing, switching to
a new plan without specifying `trial_from_plan` will maintain the trial. We
recommend setting an explicit trial per subscription instead of setting trials
on plans.
- When changing the plan on a subscription to a new plan with a trial (together
with `trial_from_plan=true`), the new plan’s full trial period will be added to
the subscription, without subtracting already-used time from previous trials.

### 2018-02-28

- Updating a subscription set to cancel on a future date no longer clears the
cancellation status. In order to clear the cancellation status, specify
[cancel_at_period_end=false](https://docs.stripe.com/api#update_subscription-cancel_at_period_end)
when updating a subscription.

### 2018-02-06

- For a Source’s `card[three_d_secure]` property, adds `recommended` as a
possible value. Previously, the only valid values were `not supported`,
`optional`, and `required`.

### 2018-02-05

- Major
Each plan object is now linked to a product object with `type=service`. The plan
object `statement_descriptor` and `name` attributes have been [moved to
product](https://docs.stripe.com/api#product_object-statement_descriptor)
objects, and plan objects now have a `nickname` attribute. Creating a plan now
requires passing a [product
attribute](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_plan-product) to `POST /v1/plans`.
This may be either an existing product ID or a dictionary of product fields, so
that you may continue to create plans without separately creating products.
- Products now have a required `type`: `good` for products used with Orders
SKUs, or `service` for products used with Subscriptions and Plans.

- On API versions older than 2018-02-05, `type` is set to `good` by default, and
`GET /v1/products` omits products with `type=service` from the list. (If you
want to see products with `type=service` on API versions older than 2018-02-05,
you can specify
[type=service](https://docs.stripe.com/api/products/list#list_products-type)
when listing products.)
- Major
Allows a new subscription’s first full invoice to be on a future date, by
specifying `billing_cycle_anchor`, with an optional proration up to that
date.`billing_cycle_anchor` on its own is available retroactively to past
versions, and starting in this version, `billing_cycle_anchor` can be combined
with a trial, enabling a free trial to be followed by a prorated period,
followed by a fixed billing cycle.
- Prorations on free plans now create $0 invoices. In past versions, these did
not create invoices.

### 2018-01-23

- When being viewed by a platform, cards and bank accounts created on behalf of
connected accounts will have a fingerprint that is universal across all
connected accounts. For accounts that are not connect platforms, there will be
no change.

### 2017-12-14

- Updates invoice payment attempts to return a `card_error` when the charge is
declined. This aligns `/v1/invoices/{INVOICE_ID}/pay` with `/v1/charges`.
- Updates invoice line items to always have a `description` set, including
invoice line items generated from subscription items.

### 2017-08-15

- Adds `not_required` as a possible `redirect[status]` value on the `Source`
object. Previously, optional redirects were marked as `succeeded`.

### 2017-06-05

- Adds `under_review` as a possible `verification[disabled_reason]` value on the
`Account` object. Previously, an under review status used the value `other`.

### 2017-05-25

- Replaces the `managed` Boolean property on `Account` objects with `type`,
whose possible values are: `standard`, `express`, and `custom`. A `type` value
is required when creating accounts. The `standard` type replaces `managed:
false`, and the `custom` type replaces `managed: true`.
- Updates the `previous_attributes` property on `Event` objects to show entire
sub-arrays when those arrays have changes. Previously, those sub-arrays only
showed the specific fields that changed.
- Updates the `request` property on the `Event` object to be a hash containing
the request ID and the idempotency key. Previously, `request` was just the ID.
- Renames the `user_id` property on Connect-related event objects to `account`.

### 2017-04-06

- Major
Splits the `Transfer` object into `Payout` and `Transfer`. The `Payout` object
represents money moving from a Stripe account to an external account (bank or
debit card). The `Transfer` object now only represents money moving between
Stripe accounts on a Connect platform. For more details, see
[https://stripe.com/docs/transfer-payout-split](https://stripe.com/docs/transfer-payout-split).

### 2017-02-14

- Updates the `dispute` property on the `Charge` object to contain the ID of an
associated dispute. Previously, `dispute` contained the entire `Dispute` object.
You can [expand this property](https://stripe.com/docs/api#expanding_objects)
when retrieving charges to render the full `Dispute` object as before.
- Updates the `outcome[rule]` property on the `Charge` object to contain the ID
of the rule that blocked the charge. Previously, `outcome[rule]` contained the
entire `Rule` object. You can [expand this
property](https://stripe.com/docs/api#expanding_objects) when retrieving charges
to render the full `Rule` object as before.

### 2017-01-27

- Removes the `sourced_transfers` property from the `Balance Transaction`
object.

### 2016-10-19

- Returns the status code 403 when an API request is made with insufficient
permission. Previously, the API returned a 401 status code.

### 2016-07-06

- Updates the list all subscriptions call to also return canceled subscriptions.
The endpoint now supports fetching only canceled subscriptions by specifying
`status=canceled`. You can now retrieve a single canceled subscription by
providing its ID.

### 2016-06-15

- Updates the `active` property on the `Product` object so that setting `active`
to false no longer marks the product’s SKUs as inactive.

### 2016-03-07

- Removes the `currencies_supported` property from the `Account` object. You can
find a list of supported currencies by retrieving a `Country Spec` object for
the country of the account.

### 2016-02-29

- Adds postal code validation for legal entity addresses when creating and
updating accounts.

### 2016-02-23

- Updates the behavior of orders so that changing an order from `paid` or
`fulfilled` to `canceled` or `returned` automatically refunds the associated
charge. Previously, attempting to change an order from `paid` or `fulfilled` to
`canceled` or `returned` raised an error if the associated charge had not
already been refunded.

### 2016-02-22

- Returns an error on attempts to add more than 250 invoice items to an invoice.

### 2016-02-19

- Renames the `name` property on the `Bank Account` object to
`account_holder_name`.

### 2016-02-03

- Updates the returned `Account` object to only show sub-properties of
`legal_entity` that are applicable to the account’s country, or that were
previously provided.

### 2015-10-16

- Returns an error if a `tax_percent` is provided without a `plan` during a
customer update or creation.

### 2015-10-12

- Major
Returns an error when invalid parameters are passed in the card or bank account
hash during token, source, or external account creation. Changes the error code
returned for missing required parameters in the card or bank account hash to
400. Previously, a 402 code was returned.

### 2015-10-01

- Replaces the `bank_accounts` property on the `Account` object with
`external_accounts`. Replaces the `bank_account` value in the `fields_needed`
property with `external_account`.

### 2015-09-23

- Updates the `charge` property on the `Invoice` object to always show the
invoice’s latest charge, regardless of the charge’s source (e.g, a card or a
bank account). Removes the `payment` property, which previously reflected a
non-card charge.
- Major
Updates the list all charges call to return all charges, including those made to
bank accounts and other non-card sources. Previously, it only returned charges
made to cards. Updates the deprecated `offset` parameter to only be supported
when filtering by source type.

### 2015-09-08

- Updates API rate limit errors to return a 429 HTTP status code instead of 400.
They also no longer return a `rate_limit` error code.

### 2015-09-03

- Returns an error if a request reuses an idempotency token with different
parameters than the original request. Previously, errors were only returned for
reusing the same idempotency token across different API endpoints.

### 2015-08-19

- Updates the `Balance Transaction` object to provide the refund ID or dispute
ID as the `source` value when the balance transaction is associated with a
refund or dispute. Previously, the original charge ID was shown.

### 2015-08-07

- Adds date validation to the `tos_acceptance[date]` property on the `Account`
object. Accepted values are timestamps after 2009 and before the current moment.

### 2015-07-28

- The `balance.available` event is now triggered when immediate transfers are
processed.

### 2015-07-13

- Replaces the `verification[contacted]` Boolean property on the `Account`
object with a `verification[disabled_reason]` string that describes why the
account is unable to make transfers or charges.

### 2015-07-07

- Updates the `status` property on the `Transfer` object so that transfers not
yet submitted to the bank are still `pending` and transfers submitted to the
bank that have not yet arrived are `in_transit`. Previously, both states were
described as `pending`.

### 2015-06-15

- Updates the `payout_schedule[delay_days]` property on the `Account` object to
return an error if provided when the `interval` is set to `manual`. Manual
payouts always use the minimum `delay_days` value.

### 2015-04-07

- Updates the `period[end]` property on proration invoice line items to reflect
the subscription’s `current_period_end` property when the update and proration
was made. A proration invoice line item’s `period[start]` and `period[end]`
properties now represent the prorated adjustment interval. Previously,
`period[end]` marked the time at which the proration was made, and was the same
as `period[start]`.
- Updates the `Invoice` object to change the order of the `lines` list: first
invoice items in reverse chronological order, followed by the subscription, if
applicable.

### 2015-03-24

- Updates coupons so they no longer apply to negative invoice items by default.
Previously, coupons applied to all non-proration invoice items. To allow a
coupon to apply to a negative invoice item, pass `discountable=true` when
creating or updating the invoice item.

### 2015-02-18

- Updates the `status` property on the `Charge` object to have a value of
`succeeded` for successful charges. Previously, the `status` property would be
`paid` for successful charges.
- Major
Replaces the `card` property on the `Charge` object with `source`. Provide this
parameter with a `Card` token, as before, or with a `Source` token that has an
`object` value of `card`. Older API versions return both the `card` and `source`
properties on `Charge`.
- Major
Replaces the `cards` and `default_card` properties on the `Customer` object with
`sources` and `default_source`. Both properties can represent `Card` objects, as
before, and `Source` objects with an `object` value of `card`. Older API
versions return both the new and old properties on `Customer`. Replaces the
`customer.card.*` and `customer.bank_account.*` events with `customer.source.*`.

### 2015-02-16

- Renames the `transfer.canceled` event to `transfer.reversed`.

### 2015-02-10

- Adds the value `warning_closed` to the `status` property on the `Dispute`
object.
- Updates test mode transfers to require sufficient funds in your available test
mode balance (for consistency with live mode transfers). Add funds directly to
your available test mode balance—bypassing the pending balance—by creating a
charge using the special test card number **4000 0000 0000 0077**.

### 2015-01-26

- Updates the presentation of nested hashes in the `previous_attributes`
property of events to only show the difference. For example, a change from
`{address: {line1: "Foo", line2: "Bar"}}` to `{address: {line1: "Foo", line2:
"Baz"}}` is represented as `{previous_attributes: {address: {line2: "Baz"}}}`.
Previously, it was represented as `{previous_attributes: {address: {line1:
"Foo", line2: "Baz"}}}`.
- Updates the `canceled_at` property on the `Subscription` object to always be
the timestamp from the API call or invoice payment failure that canceled the
subscription. Previously, `canceled_at` reflected “at period end” subscription
cancellations, too. The `ended_at` property still reflects the time that the
subscription actually stopped.

### 2015-01-11

- Removes the `mimetype` property from the `File Upload` object. Returns
simplified file types in the `type` property and uses simpler naming conventions
than mimetypes (e.g., `type` contains **pdf** instead of **application/pdf**).

### 2014-12-22

- Updates the `Card` object so a value of `unchecked` for the
`address_line1_check`, `address_zip_check`, or `cvc_check` properties means the
property has not been checked. Previously, it meant the issuing bank does not
support the particular check. That state now shows as `unavailable`. Unchecked
properties are checked when a card is charged or added to a `Customer` object.
- Removes the `customer` property from the `Card` object that appears on the
`Token` object.

### 2014-12-17

- Replaces the `statement_description` property on the `Charge`, `Invoice`,
`Plan`, and `Transfer` objects with `statement_descriptor`. To determine what
appears on a customer’s transaction, `statement_description` is appended to your
Stripe account’s statement descriptor while `statement_descriptor` sets the full
statement value. If not on this API version or newer, providing a
`statement_descriptor` still triggers the `statement_description` behavior.
Regardless of API version, the `statement_description` behavior does not apply
with PaymentIntents.
- Updates the Accounts API to require API version 2014-12-17 or newer.

### 2014-12-08

- Updates the `Dispute` object so evidence can be provided as a hash of typed
fields rather than a single block of text. Replaces the `evidence_due_by`
property with the `evidence_details` hash, which includes `due_by` and
`submission_count` (for the number of times a dispute has been submitted).

### 2014-11-20

- Updates disputes that are won to return the status `won` even if the charge
was refunded. Previously, a dispute won that had a refunded charge would
transition to `charge_refunded`.
- Updates the `metadata` property of the `Invoice Item` object with a type of
`subscription` to show the subscription’s metadata. Previously, it showed the
plan’s metadata.

### 2014-11-05

- Renames the `charge_enabled` and `transfer_enabled` properties on the
`Account` object to `charges_enabled` and `transfers_enabled`.

### 2014-10-07

- Prevents publishable keys from retrieving `Token` objects. When a card or bank
account token is created with a publishable key, the `fingerprint` property is
not included in the response.

### 2014-09-08

- Replaces the `disabled`, `validated`, and `verified` properties on the `Bank
Account` object with a `status` enum property.

### 2014-08-20

- Adds three values to the `status` property on the `Dispute` object:
`warning_needs_response`, `warning_under_review`, and `charge_refunded`.
Replaces the `balance_transaction` property of the `Dispute` object with
`balance_transactions` (this provides greater detail around funds withdrawn and
reinstated as a result of disputes).

### 2014-08-04

- Removes the `other_transfers`, `summary`, and `transactions` properties from
automatic transfer responses in favor of the balance history endpoint
(**/v1/balance/history**). *Update*: As of June 20, 2024, these properties are
no longer available in any versions, including those prior to 2014-08-04.

### 2014-07-26

- Changes the `refunds` property on the `Application Fee` object from an array
to a sublist object, which contains the `data`, `has_more`, and `url`
properties. This makes application fee refunds consistent with charge refunds.

### 2014-07-22

- Updates proration line items on invoices to include the associated
subscription’s plan and quantity.

### 2014-06-17

- Changes the `refunds` property on the `Charge` object from an array to a
sublist object, which contains the `data`, `has_more`, and `url` properties.

### 2014-06-13

- Renames the `type` property on the `Card` object to `brand`.

### 2014-05-19

- Replaces the `account` property on the `Transfer` object with `bank_account`.
The `bank_account` property is only included when the transfer is made to a bank
account.

### 2014-03-28

- Major
Removes the `count` property from list responses.

### 2014-03-13

- Renames the `statement_descriptor` property on the `Transfer` object to
`statement_description`.

### 2014-01-31

- Major
Replaces the `subscription` property on the `Customer` object with the
`subscriptions` property, as customers can have multiple subscriptions.
- Ignores trial dates on canceled subscriptions when automatically computing
trial end dates for new subscriptions.

### 2013-12-03

- Replaces the `user` and `user_email` properties on the `Application Fee`
object with an expandable `account` property.
- Updates the refunding of application fees to be proportional to the amount of
the charge refunded (when setting `refund_application_fee=true`). Previously,
the entire application fee was refunded even when only part of the charge was.

### 2013-10-29

- Major
Changes coupon behavior so that applying an amount-off coupon to an invoice does
not increase the `Customer` account balance if the discount is greater than the
invoice amount. Coupons are ignored—and not counted as redeemed—when applied to
zero-cost invoices. This change does not apply to coupons created on earlier API
version.

### 2013-08-13

- Removes the `fee` and `fee_details` properties from the `Charge` and
`Transfer` objects. Fee information is in the corresponding balance transaction.

### 2013-08-12

- Allows the `description` property on `Customer`, `Charge`, `InvoiceItem`, and
`Recipient` objects, and the `email` property on `Customer` and `Recipient`
objects, to be set to null by providing empty string values in POST requests.

### 2013-07-05

- Major
Replaces the `active_card` property on the `Customer` object with a `cards`
sublist and a `default_card` ID property.

### 2013-02-13

- Updates the `Charge` object so disputed charges include another `stripe_fee`
object in the `fee_details` array, representing the dispute fees. Includes the
dispute fees in the fee total on the `Charge` object.

### 2013-02-11

- Major
Updates the pay invoice call to return an error when the charge is not
successful. Previously, the API would return a 200 status and set the invoice’s
`paid` property to false.

### 2012-11-07

- Replaces the `disputed` property on the `Charge` object with `dispute`.

### 2012-10-26

- Updates the `Invoice` object format. The `lines` property is now a *sublist*,
a paginated list of all items that contribute to the invoice.

### 2012-09-24

- Removes the extraneous `id` property from the `Discount` object.

### 2012-07-09

- Removes the `uncaptured` property from the `Customer` object.

### 2012-06-18

- Removes the `amount` and `currency` properties from the `Token` object.

### 2012-03-25

- Removes the `next_recurring_charge` property from the `Customer` object. Use
the upcoming invoice call instead.

hid fields with null values.

### 2011-09-15

- Updates the card validation behavior when creating tokens.

### 2011-08-01

- Updates the list format. New list objects have a `data` property that
represents an array of objects (by default, 10) and a `count` property that
represents the total count.

### 2011-06-28

- Removes the `identifier` property (duplicate of `id`) from the `Plan` object.

### 2011-06-21

- Raises exceptions on unrecognized parameters passed to the API instead of
silently allowing and ignoring them.
