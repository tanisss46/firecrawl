This topic covers:\n\n- [Why introduce a new\ncategorization?](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/reporting-categories#why-new-categorization)\n- [Reporting categories\nreference](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/reporting-categories#reference)\n\n## Why introduce a new categorization?\n\nThe `BalanceTransaction` object’s `reporting_category` field improves on the\n`type` field by providing a more-useful grouping for most finance and reporting\npurposes. The following sections highlight the new field’s advantages.\n\n##### More-granular breakdown of `type=adjustment`\n\nThe `reporting_category` attribute separates balance transactions with\n`type=adjustment` into several different categories, including disputes, dispute\nreversals, and failed refunds. Additionally, several types of fees and\n[Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect) platform-fee refunds are now\nexplicitly categorized with `reporting_category=fee`.\n\n#### A separate category for partial-capture reversals\n\nIf you are [separately authorizing and\ncapturing](https://docs.stripe.com/charges/placing-a-hold) payments, and you\ncapture an amount less than the initial authorization, you will see two balance\ntransactions: one for the full amount of the authorization, and another\nreversing the uncaptured portion. (Summing the two balance transactions yields\nthe captured portion of the charge.)\n\nThe balance transaction reversing the uncaptured portion has `type=refund`, just\nas if you had refunded a portion of a sale at some later time. To allow separate\nhandling of these objects—perhaps counting them against the initial sale amount,\nrather than as a separate refund—we label these with the distinct reporting\ncategory `partial_capture_reversal`.\n\n#### Consolidate multiple types into common categories\n\nUsing the `type` field, balance transactions arising from card-based charges are\nrepresented with `type=charge`, while those made with [other payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/overview) are\nrepresented with `type=payment`. Similarly, refunds and failures for cards\nversus alternative payment methods have the distinct types `refund` and\n`payment_refund`.\n\nWe found that these distinctions made many common reporting tasks unnecessarily\nawkward, and so `reporting_category` simplifies these (and other) groups of\ntypes, as follows:\n\nBalance transaction typesReporting category`charge`, `payment``charge``refund`,\n`payment_refund``refund``payout_cancel`,\n`payout_failure``payout_reversal``transfer`,\n`recipient_transfer``transfer``transfer_cancel`, `transfer_failure`,\n`recipient_transfer_cancel`, `recipient_transfer_failure``transfer_reversal`\n##### More-descriptive category names\n\nWe’ve renamed several balance transaction types for greater clarity:\n\nBalance transaction typeReporting\ncategory`application_fee``platform_earning``application_fee_refund``platform_earning_refund``stripe_fee``fee``reserve_transaction``connect_reserved_funds``reserved_funds``risk_reserved_funds`\n## Reporting categories reference\n\nThis reference covers four groups of reporting categories:\n\n- [Payments-related reporting\ncategories](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/reporting-categories#charge_and_payment_related)\n- [Balance-related reporting\ncategories](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/reporting-categories#balance_related)\n- [Issuing-related reporting\ncategories](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/reporting-categories#issuing_related)\n- [Connect-related reporting\ncategories](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/reporting-categories#connect_related)\n\n### Payments-related reporting categories\n\nThese reporting categories are related to creating and refunding charges as part\nof processing payments.\n\n### `charge`\n\n[Charges](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/charges-api) include payments from\ncards and from [other payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#supported-payment-methods). If you are\n[separately authorizing and\ncapturing](https://docs.stripe.com/charges/placing-a-hold) payments, only the\ncaptured charges will be included here.\n\n- Balance transaction type(s): `charge`, `payment`, or `validation`\n- Section(s) in the monthly report: *Payments (cards), Payments (other)*\n\n### `charge_failure`\n\n[ACH, direct debit](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#supported-payment-methods),\nand other [asynchronous payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#synchronous-or-asynchronous-confirmation)\nremain in a pending state until they either succeed or fail. You will see a\npending balance transaction with the reporting category `charge` appear when the\npayment is created in a pending state. A `charge_failure` will appear if the\npending payment later fails.\n\n- Balance transaction type(s): `payment_failure_refund`\n- Section(s) in the monthly report: *Other Adjustments*\n\n### `dispute`\n\nWhen a customer [disputes a charge](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes), Stripe\ndeducts the disputed amount from your balance.\n\n- Balance transaction type(s): `adjustment`or\n`adjusted_for_overdraft_transaction`\n- Section(s) in the monthly report: *Disputes*\n\n### `dispute_reversal`\n\nWhen you [win a\ndispute](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes#responding-to-a-dispute), the disputed\namount is returned to your balance.\n\n- Balance transaction type(s): `adjustment`\n- Section(s) in the monthly report: *Dispute Reversals*\n\n### `partial_capture_reversal`\n\nIf you are [separately authorizing and\ncapturing](https://docs.stripe.com/charges/placing-a-hold) payments, and you\ncapture an amount less than the initial authorization, you will see a `charge`\nfor the full authorization amount, and a `partial_capture_reversal` for the\nuncaptured portion.\n\n- Balance transaction type(s): `refund`\n- Section(s) in the monthly report: *Payments (cards)*\n\n### `refund`\n\nPayments you’ve [refunded](https://docs.stripe.com/refunds) to your customers.\n(Does not include charge failures or partial capture reversals, which are listed\nseparately.)\n\n- Balance transaction type(s): `refund`or `payment_refund`\n- Section(s) in the monthly report: *Refunds (cards), Refunds (other)*\n\n### `refund_failure`\n\nCreated when a [credit card charge refund](https://docs.stripe.com/refunds)\nfails, and Stripe returns the funds to your balance.\n\nThis may occur if your customer’s bank or card issuer is unable to correctly\nprocess a refund (e.g., due to a closed bank account or a problem with the\ncard).\n\n- Balance transaction type(s): `refund_failure`\n- Section(s) in the monthly report: *Other Adjustments*\n\n### Balance-related reporting categories\n\nThese reporting categories are related to changes that affect your Stripe\nbalance, such as payouts, fees, and top-ups.\n\n### `anticipation_repayment`\n\nRepayments made to service an anticipation loan in Brazil.
