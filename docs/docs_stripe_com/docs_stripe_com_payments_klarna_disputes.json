The exceptions are\ndisputes raised because of fraudulent transactions, which escalate immediately\nto [chargeback\ndisputes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/klarna/disputes#chargeback-disputes).\n\nInquiry disputes are an opportunity to resolve a customer’s issue before the\ndispute escalates to a chargeback and carries a fee. Klarna doesn’t accept\nevidence to challenge an inquiry dispute. Contact your customer during the\n21-day inquiry period. Listen to the customer’s reason for raising this dispute\nto find an amicable resolution within the 21-day period preceding automatic\nescalation. For example, a customer you successfully reassure that their\npurchased goods are delayed rather than undelivered can withdraw their inquiry\ndispute directly with Klarna.\n\nYou can also perform one of the following actions:\n\n- Accept the dispute. Confirm the disputed amount with the customer and issue a\nrefund. Refunding during the inquiry dispute period avoids a dispute fee.\n- Allow the dispute to escalate. If you’re unable to resolve the issue within\nthe 21 days, you can submit evidence to challenge the dispute after it escalates\nto a chargeback.\n\n#### Refunds as inquiry disputes\n\nCustomers paying with Klarna use inquiry disputes as a means to request refunds\nfrom businesses. If you receive an inquiry dispute with the\n[Return](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/categories?card-network=klarna) Klarna\ndispute code, consider this the customer’s request for a refund, rather than a\ngreater dispute against the payment. As with other inquiry disputes, contact the\ncustomer, understand why they’ve requested the refund, and process it\nappropriately.\n\n### Chargeback disputes\n\nIf an inquiry dispute remains unresolved after the 21-day timeframe, the dispute\nautomatically escalates to a chargeback dispute. Stripe withholds the disputed\nfunds and the associated [dispute\nfee](https://stripe.com/pricing/local-payment-methods#klarna) from your account\nfor this payment until the dispute is resolved.\n\nDuring the chargeback dispute stage, you can counter disputes by [submitting\nevidence](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/klarna/disputes#evidence-submission)\nto Klarna, either in the Stripe Dashboard or with the API. Starting from the\nchargeback dispute creation date, you have 13 days to submit evidence. If you\nchoose to counter the dispute by submitting evidence, Klarna will evaluate your\nresponse to decide the outcome of the dispute.\n\n- If you win the dispute, Stripe releases the aforementioned withheld funds to\nyour account, including the associated [dispute\nfee](https://stripe.com/pricing/local-payment-methods#klarna).\n- If you lose the dispute, Stripe debits the withheld funds, including the\nassociated [dispute\nfee](https://stripe.com/pricing/local-payment-methods#klarna). Klarna then\nreturns the disputed amount to the customer.\n\n## Funds flow\n\n### Funds flow for a resolved inquiry dispute\n\nThe following diagram shows what happens when you resolve the inquiry dispute\nwithout a chargeback escalation.\n\nCustomer\n\nKlarna\n\nStripe\n\nMerchant\n\nReports a problem with the order\n\nOpens an inquiry dispute\n\nNotifies inquiry dispute is open\n\nOpens an inquiry dispute\n\nNotifies merchant inquiry is open\n\nwebhook\nResolves the dispute in 21 days\n\nVerifies the problem is resolved.

Now, Klarna disputes are managed in the\nStripe Dashboard and with the API. This table highlights key differences between\nthe old email-based disputes process and the new Dashboard and API process:\n\nEmail disputesDashboard and API disputesYou don’t receive notifications from\nKlarna and Stripe for inquiry disputes.Stripe notifies you in the Dashboard,\nAPI, and by email when an inquiry is opened.You can submit multiple rounds of\nevidence for a chargeback dispute.You can only submit a single round of\nstructured evidence for a chargeback dispute.You have 14 days to submit counter\nevidence from the creation date of the chargeback dispute.You have 13 days to\nsubmit counter evidence from the creation date of the chargeback dispute.Dispute\nlifecycle management must be built by you on top of the emails you receive from\nKlarna.You can manage the entire dispute life cycle and track the status in a\nsingle place using the Dashboard or API.Stripe doesn’t withhold funds when\nKlarna creates a chargeback dispute.Stripe withholds the disputed funds when\nKlarna creates a chargeback dispute.\nWhen an inquiry dispute starts off as an email dispute, it persists as an email\ndispute, even after onboarding to use the Dashboard or API for new disputes. If\nyou lose an email dispute, it displays as lost in the Dashboard, you receive a\nwebhook, and Stripe applies the [dispute\nfee](https://stripe.com/pricing/local-payment-methods#klarna).\n\n## Evidence submission\n\nTo submit evidence against a chargeback dispute, use either the Dashboard or\nAPI:\n\nDashboardAPI\n### Submit evidence\n\n- Navigate to the [Disputes Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/disputes),\nand click the **Needs Response** tab.\n- Click the disputed payment. If you want to counter the dispute, click\n**Counter dispute**.\n- Select the reason why you should win the dispute, and click **Next**.\n- Enter and attach all the applicable supporting evidence. The `recommended`\nlabel indicates the best documents for the type of dispute.\n- After entering all the evidence, verify the information is correct by\nselecting the checkbox.\n- Click **Submit Evidence**.\n\nFor additional guidance on how to submit evidence, see [Responding to\ndisputes](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/responding).\n\nIf you fail to submit evidence, Klarna will rule the dispute in favor of the\ncustomer.\n\n[OptionalAccept dispute\nloss](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/klarna/disputes#accept-loss)\n## Guidelines\n\nFollow these guidelines to submit the most relevant evidence for both Dashboard\nand API disputes.\n\nStripe dispute reasonGuidelinesProduct not received- Attach all the shipping\ndetails, such as the tracking number, carrier, shipped date, and customer\ncommunication.\nCredit not processed- If you receive the returned product, attach the date when\nthe customer initiated the return and any other information related to the\nreturn.\n- If the customer confirms that the dispute is for a partial order, share the\ncustomer communication and the return order amount.\n- If the return hasn’t been received, share when the customer initiated the\nreturn and make a note that the return hasn’t yet been received.\n- If the customer didn’t communicate or failed to reply to your request,\ndocument in the evidence when your team attempted to contact the customer, the\nnumber of attempts made, and the lack of response received.\n- If you fully or partially refunded the payment prior to it becoming a\nchargeback dispute, attach the refund details.\nFraudulent- Share the shipping policy as an attachment or link to your shipping\npolicy.\nGeneral- If the customer confirms that the price is incorrect, attach all the\nsupporting documents against the claim, such as order details.\n- If you fully or partially refunded the payment prior to it becoming a\nchargeback dispute, attach the refund details.\n[Create test\ndisputes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/klarna/disputes#create-test-disputes)\nYou can simulate dispute creation in test mode by creating a transaction in test\nmode using the following email addresses and phone numbers in the given Klarna\ncheckout region. A dispute automatically opens on the transaction. You can\nsubmit evidence on the dispute, but you can’t simulate the final dispute outcome\nin test mode.\n\nBelow, we have specially selected test data for the currently supported customer\ncountries.\n\nAustraliaAustriaBelgiumCanadaCzechiaDenmarkFinlandFranceGermanyGreeceIrelandItalyNetherlandsNew\nZealandNorwayPolandPortugalRomaniaSpainSwedenSwitzerlandUnited KingdomUnited\nStatesStripe dispute reasonKlarna dispute reasonEmailPhone numberCredit not\nprocessedReturn`customer+disputed-return@email.au``+61491574118`Product not\nreceivedGoods not\nreceived`customer+disputed-goods_not_received@email.au``+61491574632`DuplicateAlready\npaid`customer+disputed-already_paid@email.au``+61491575254`Product\nunacceptableFaulty\ngoods`customer+disputed-faulty_goods@email.au``+61491575789`GeneralIncorrect\ninvoice`customer+disputed-incorrect_invoice@email.au``+61491575789`GeneralHigh\nrisk\norder`customer+disputed-high_risk_order@email.au``+61491576801`FraudulentUnauthorized\npurchase`customer+disputed-unauthorized_purchase@email.au``+61491577426`\n## Dispute API\n\nA [Dispute object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/disputes/object) contains\na dispute type and Klarna dispute reason.
