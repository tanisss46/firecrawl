Businesses often offer a limited amount of promotional\ncredits, and typically with an expiration date.\n\nThe following diagram shows how billing credits work with usage-based billing:\n\nCustomer\nCredit grant\n\nInvoice\n\nMeter events\n\nhas (multiple)applies togeneratesaggregated (meter) and rated (price)\n## Use cases for billing credits\n\nRefer to the following guidance for using billing credits.\n\n**Approved uses**\n\n- You can issue billing credits to your customers either for free or for a fee.\n- Your customers can use billing credits to pay for memberships, pay-as-you-go\nplans, subscriptions, or specific products or services that you offer.\n\n**Prohibited uses**\n\n- You can’t issue billing credits as gift cards or gift certificates. Also, you\ncan’t allow your customers to spend billing credits on, or exchange billing\ncredits for, gift cards or gift certificates.\n- You can’t offer billing credits as stored value to your customers. That means\nyou can’t grant any billing credits that aren’t intended for spending on\nmemberships, pay-as-you-go plans, subscriptions, or specific products or\nservices that you offer.\n- You can’t allow your customers to use billing credits for payments to third\nparties. For example, you can’t allow them to apply billing credits to purchases\non the website or platform of another business.\n- You can’t link billing credits to digital wallets, or allow your customers to\ndo so. For example, you can’t allow your customers to add billing credits to a\ndigital wallet, such as Apple Pay or Google Pay.\n\n## Credit grants\n\nA [Credit Grant](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/credit-grant) tracks a set\nof prepaid or promotional billing credits allocated to a customer. Credit grants\nhave the following states:\n\nStateDescriptionPendingThe\n[available_balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/credit-balance-summary/object#billing_credit_balance_summary_object-balances-available_balance)\non the credit grant isn’t yet available for use.GrantedThe credit grant is\neligible for use based on the\n[effective_at](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/credit-grant/object#billing_credit_grant_object-effective_at)\ntimestamp, which must occur in the future. If you don’t set this field, the\ncredit grant is effective immediately.DepletedThe balance on the credit grant is\nfully used.ExpiredYou can immediately\n[expire](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/credit-grant/expire) any remaining\ncredits on a credit grant, or you can specify an expiration time for the credit\ngrant using the\n[expires_at](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/credit-grant/object#billing_credit_grant_object-expires_at)\nfield. Credits won’t expire unless you set this field.VoidedYou can only\n[void](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/credit-grant/void) credit grants that\nyou haven’t applied to an invoice, either partially or completely. You can’t\napply voided credit grants to future invoices, but you can expire any remaining\ncredits.\n## Credit grant eligibility\n\nYou can apply credit grants to invoices if all of the following are true:\n\n- The invoice’s\n[period_end](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-period_end)\nis on or after the credit grant’s\n[effective_at](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/credit-grant/object#billing_credit_grant_object-effective_at)\ntime.\n- The invoice’s `period_end` occurs before the credit grant’s\n[expires_at](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/credit-grant/object#billing_credit_grant_object-expires_at)\ntime, if set.\n- The credit grant has an available balance when the invoice finalizes.\n- The credit grant’s currency matches the invoice currency.\n\nYou can only apply credit grants to subscription items that use\n[metered](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/object#price_object-recurring-usage_type)\nprices and report usage through\n[Meters](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter).\n\nYou can’t apply credit grants to:\n\n- One-off invoices that weren’t created by a subscription.\n- One-time invoice items which are added to a subscription’s upcoming invoice,\nsuch as an initial setup fee.\n- [Line items](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-lines)\non subscription invoices that use\n[licensed](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/object#price_object-recurring-usage_type)\nprices.\n- [Line items](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-lines)\non subscription invoices that use\n[metered](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/object#price_object-recurring-usage_type)\nprices but report usage through legacy [Usage\nRecords](https://docs.stripe.com/api/usage_records).\n\n## Apply credit grants\n\nYou can apply credit grants to\n[subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-subscription)\nline items that link to a [meter\nprice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/object#price_object-recurring-meter).\nCredit grants apply to invoices after discounts, but before taxes and the\n[invoice_credit_balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-invoice_credit_balance).\n\n### Price-level applicability\n\nWhen creating a credit grant, you can configure the [applicability\nscope](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/credit-grant/create#create_billing_credit_grant-applicability_config-scope-price_type)\nto specify a list of metered prices to which a credit grant can apply. If the\nprice on a subscription item matches one of the credit grant’s applicable\nprices, then the credit grant could apply to that item.\n\n### Multiple invoices or line items\n\nIf you can apply a credit grant to multiple invoices, the credit applies first\nto the invoice that finalizes first. Because subscription invoices finalize\nindependently as soon as they’re eligible, we can’t guarantee the finalization\norder.\n\nIf you can apply a credit grant to multiple\n[lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-lines) on the\nsame invoice, the credit applies to the lines in the order they appear on the\ninvoice.\n\n### Multiple credit grants\n\nIf you can apply multiple credit grants to an invoice or line item, they’re\nprioritized as follows:\n\n- **Priority**: Credit grants with higher\n[priority](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/credit-grant/object#billing_credit_grant_object-priority)\n(lower number indicates a higher priority) apply first.\n- **Expiration date**: Credit grants with earlier\n[expires_at](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/credit-grant/object#billing_credit_grant_object-expires_at)\ntimestamps apply first.\n- **Category**: Credit grants with the `promotional` category apply first.\n- **Effective date**: Credit grants with earlier\n[effective_at](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/credit-grant/object#billing_credit_grant_object-effective_at)\ntimestamps apply first.\n- **Created date**: Credit grants with earlier\n[created](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/credit-grant/object#billing_credit_grant_object-created)\ntimestamps apply first.\n\n### Upcoming, draft, or finalized invoices\n\nCredits apply to invoices only at the time of\n[finalization](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/workflow-transitions#finalized).\nIf you apply credits to an\n[upcoming](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming) or\n[draft](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/overview#draft) invoice, those credits\nmight change if a finalized invoice uses them first.\n\n**Example 1**: At the end of a cycle, the same set of credits appear on both a\ndraft invoice and an upcoming invoice. When finalized, the draft invoice uses\nthe credits. The upcoming invoice adjusts to accurately reflect any remaining\ncredits from the credit grant.\n\n**Example 2**: A customer has multiple active subscriptions and the same set of\ncredits appear on an upcoming invoice for all of the subscriptions. If there\naren’t enough credits to apply to all the subscriptions when the invoices\nfinalize, only some invoices receive the credits. If you use [billing\nthresholds](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based/alerts-and-thresholds#billing-thresholds),\nthey might trigger later than expected because of the credits that apply to\nmultiple upcoming invoices.\n\n## Credit balance summaries and transactions\n\nThe [Credit Balance\nSummary](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/credit-balance-summary) shows the\nfollowing for a customer:\n\n- **Ledger balance**: The balance amount reflects the billing credit balance\nafter recording all relevant account ledger transactions. A credit grant is\nbacked by an immutable, append-only ledger.\n- **Available balance**: The billing credit balance available for the customer\nto use. This amount is equal to the ledger balance less any expired credits or\nunrecorded transactions.\n\nA [Credit Balance\nTransaction](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/credit-balance-transaction)\nincludes the credits and debits that impact a credit grant. For example, you\nmight see a credit transaction for initial funding of the credit grant, or a\ndebit transaction for a credit grant on an invoice.\n\n## Void invoices and issue credit notes\n\nThe following is true if you void invoices and issue credit notes:\n\n- [Voiding an invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/void) with credits\napplied reinstates the applied balance to the credit grant. If the credit grant\nis past the expiration date, the reinstated credits expire immediately.\n- Issuing a [Credit Note](https://docs.stripe.com/api/credit_notes/object)\ndoesn’t refund credit grants applied to an invoice. To restore those billing\ncredits, you must create a new credit grant.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Credit Grant](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/credit-grant)\n-\n[available_balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/credit-balance-summary/object#billing_credit_balance_summary_object-balances-available_balance)\n-\n[effective_at](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/credit-grant/object#billing_credit_grant_object-effective_at)\n- [expire](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/credit-grant/expire)\n-\n[expires_at](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/credit-grant/object#billing_credit_grant_object-expires_at)\n- [void](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/credit-grant/void)\n-\n[period_end](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-period_end)\n-\n[metered](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/object#price_object-recurring-usage_type)\n- [Meters](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter)\n- [Line items](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-lines)\n- [Usage Records](https://docs.stripe.com/api/usage_records)\n-\n[subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-subscription)\n- [meter\nprice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/object#price_object-recurring-meter)\n-\n[invoice_credit_balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-invoice_credit_balance)\n- [applicability\nscope](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/credit-grant/create#create_billing_credit_grant-applicability_config-scope-price_type)\n-\n[priority](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/credit-grant/object#billing_credit_grant_object-priority)\n-\n[created](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/credit-grant/object#billing_credit_grant_object-created)\n-\n[finalization](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/workflow-transitions#finalized)\n- [upcoming](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming)\n- [draft](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/overview#draft)\n- [billing\nthresholds](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based/alerts-and-thresholds#billing-thresholds)\n- [Credit Balance\nSummary](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/credit-balance-summary)\n- [Credit Balance\nTransaction](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/credit-balance-transaction)\n- [Voiding an invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/void)\n- [Credit Note](https://docs.stripe.com/api/credit_notes/object)",
