There are different types of cards and\nseveral steps in the process. To build a Stripe integration that supports all of\nyour customers, see what goes on behind the scenes of a card payment.\n\nChecking card details\nStripe checks that the details provided are formatted correctly (for example,\nthe expiry date isn’t in the past). There’s no guarantee that the card itself is\nvalid yet.\n\nCustomer authentication\nSome banks, especially in regulated regions like Europe and India, may prompt\nthe customer to authenticate a purchase (for example, by texting the customer a\ncode to enter on the bank’s website). [Watch our\nvideo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kc-FjU2-mY) to learn more.\n\nAuthorization\nThe bank checks for sufficient funds and, if successful, holds the amount on the\ncustomer’s account to guarantee it for the Stripe user.\n\nCapture\nThe money moves from the issuing bank to the Stripe user’s account.\n\n## Card updates\n\n[Updating a saved card](https://docs.stripe.com/api/cards/update) can only\nchange its name, billing address, expiration date, or metadata. To make any\nother changes, you must delete the card and create a new one.\n\nTo let your customers manage their own payment methods, implement processes that\nallow them to manually update and replace their saved cards.\n\nTo change a customer’s default payment method for invoices and subscriptions,\nmake an API call to [update\ncustomer](https://docs.stripe.com/api#update_customer) and provide a new value\nfor the `invoice_settings.default_payment_method` property.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers/cus_V9T7vofUbZMqpv \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d \"invoice_settings[default_payment_method]\"=pm_1Msy7wLkdIwHu7ixsxmFvcz7\n```\n\nFor information on how Checkout handles saved payment methods, see the [create\nsession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-customer)\nAPI reference. To consider default payment methods in other scenarios, use\ncustom code.\n\n## Automatic card updates\n\nSaved payment method details can continue to work even if the issuing bank\nreplaces the physical card. Stripe works with card networks and automatically\nattempts to update saved card details whenever a customer receives a new card\n(for example, replacing an expired card or one that was reported lost or\nstolen). This allows your customers to continue using your service without\ninterruption and reduces the need for you to collect new card details whenever a\ncard is replaced.\n\nAutomatic card updates require card issuers to participate with the network and\nprovide this information. It’s widely supported in the United States, allowing\nStripe to automatically update most American Express, Visa, Mastercard, and\nDiscover cards issued there. International support varies from country to\ncountry. It isn’t possible to identify cards that support automatic updates.\n\nYou can listen for Stripe [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) to learn\nof card update activity:\n\n- The `payment_method.updated` event notifies you of updates to a card through\nan API call.\n- The `payment_method.automatically_updated` event notifies you of automatic\ncard updates from the network.\n\nThese events include the card’s new expiration date and last four digits, so you\ncan update your own records as needed. If the card update includes a new card\nnumber, the\n[fingerprint](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object#payment_method_object-card-fingerprint)\nchanges.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/cards)\n- [Co-badged cards\ncompliance](https://docs.stripe.com/co-badged-cards-compliance)\n- [Payment method integration\noptions](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/integration-options)\n\n## Links\n\n- [local payment method\npricing](https://stripe.com/pricing/local-payment-methods)\n- [Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/cards)\n- [Watch our video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kc-FjU2-mY)\n- [Updating a saved card](https://docs.stripe.com/api/cards/update)\n- [update customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api#update_customer)\n- [create\nsession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-customer)\n- [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks)\n-\n[fingerprint](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object#payment_method_object-card-fingerprint)\n- [Co-badged cards\ncompliance](https://docs.stripe.com/co-badged-cards-compliance)\n- [Payment method integration\noptions](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/integration-options)",
