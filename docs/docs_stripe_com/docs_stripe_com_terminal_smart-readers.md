# Stripe Terminal smart readers

## Learn about Stripe's pre-certified in-person payment readers.

Terminalâ€™s smart readers are compatible with the JavaScript, iOS, Android, and
React Native SDKs. In addition to the Terminal SDKs, the BBPOS WisePOS E and the
Stripe Reader S700 are compatible with server-driven integration. Smart readers
communicate with the SDKs and Stripe API over the internet.

## Reader software updates

Stripe maintains the software that controls smart readers. The readers receive
updates automatically from Stripe when not in use. Leave your reader connected
to power to receive automatic software updates. This ensures that updates happen
at midnight (in the timezone of the assigned location) to avoid interruption to
sales. If you unplug the reader at night, an update could start when you turn it
back on. To manually check for an update, reboot the reader.

#### Note

Smart readers restart every day at midnight for PCI compliance, and disconnect
from the POS app every morning.
