Stripe\nrecommends the following as best practices when you make sales to business\ncustomers as Business-to-Business (B2B) sales require compliant invoices.\nThere’s no general obligation to issue invoices for Business-to-Consumer (B2C)\nsales.\n\n#### Note\n\nOur recommendations are for standard (full) invoices. In most countries, you can\nalso issue simplified invoices for lower amounts, which are subject to less\nstrict legal requirements.\n\n## Key invoice fields\n\nStripe doesn’t automatically populate all of the fields on an invoice. In\ncertain European countries, a missed or improperly added field can render an\ninvoice noncompliant. We recommend that you include the noted fields when you\nprepare your invoices as they’re required throughout most of Europe.\n\n![Key invoice\ndetails](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/invoice-global-config-annotations.97e5b50ca2d6c3a761449564cfe3946f.png)\n\nKey invoice details\n\n## How to add an invoice field\n\nThe following table explains the ways that you can populate different invoice\nfields. To ensure that your invoices are compliant and adhere to geographic and\nbusiness regulations, Stripe recommends that you consult with your tax and legal\nadvisors.\n\nKeyFieldRequired?How to populate1Invoice numberThis is always required.Stripe\npopulates this by default. You can change how invoices are numbered (customer or\naccount level) in the [Invoice\ntemplate](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/invoice).2Date of\nissueThis is always required.Stripe populates this by default.3Date dueThere’s\nno requirement to display the date by which a customer must pay an invoice.\nHowever, it’s a best practice.Stripe populates this by default.4aMerchant\ncompany nameThis is always required.Stripe populates this by default.4bMerchant\ncompany addressSending an invoice to another business always requires this\nfield.Enter your Support address under [Public business\ninformation](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public). You can also default\nto your business address as listed in your [account\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/account).5Merchant VAT\nID​​Invoices generally require a merchant VAT ID (or tax ID). If you sell goods\nor services to a business customer in another EU country, you must mention your\nVAT ID, which is a number that contains a country prefix.Add your relevant tax\nor VAT ID by navigating to Manage tax information in the Invoice\ntemplate.6aRecipient nameThis is always required.Stripe populates this by\ndefault.6bRecipient addressThis is always required.You can add this field by\nclicking the Additional details button when you first create a\ncustomer.7Recipient VAT IDSending an invoice to another business typically\nrequires this field. ​​If you sell goods or services to a business customer in\nanother EU country, you must mention the customer’s VAT ID, which is a number\nthat contains a country prefix.You can add this field by:- Clicking **Add\nadditional details** (just like with the recipient address) when you create a\nnew customer, and scrolling down to **Tax ID** at the bottom of the dialog.\n- Adding it as a custom field under **Additional options** when you create an\ninvoice.\n8Name of the good or serviceThis is always required.Stripe populates this by\ndefault.9Invoice line item supply dateThis is always required when the supply\ndate of individual line items is different from the invoice send date.You can\ndisplay line item supply dates by clicking the toggle under Item options.10Price\nof the good or serviceFor an invoice to be compliant, it must display\ntax-exclusive prices. For each invoice line item, you must show the following:-\nUnit price (excluding VAT).\n- Quantity.\n- Any applicable discounts.\n- Total amount payable (excluding VAT), which is the unit price times the\nquantity, minus discounts.\nYou must display tax-exclusive prices to comply with EU invoicing\nrules.111Invoice line item tax rate percentage2This is always required. It’s\nsufficient to display the tax percentage amount for an invoice line item. You’re\nnot required to display the cash amount per invoice line item.You can determine\nthe tax to display on an invoice by:- Using [Stripe\nTax](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/invoicing) to automatically calculate the tax.\n- ​​Manually adding the tax rate when you are create an item. Select **Item\ntaxes and coupons**, enter your desired tax rate, then **Create a new tax\nrate**.\n12Invoice subtotal (excludes VAT)This is always required.Stripe populates this\nby default.13VAT amountThis is always required.Stripe populates this by\ndefault.14Invoice total (includes VAT)This is always required.Stripe populates\nthis by default.N/ACustom fieldsIn some European countries, you must also\ndisplay additional information including the business registration number,\npurchase order (PO), or payment due date.Under Additional options in the\n[Invoice Editor](https://dashboard.stripe.com/invoices/create), click Add custom\nfield.\n1To display tax-exclusive prices with Stripe Tax, select **No** under **Include\ntax in price** to exclude tax. This excludes tax in prices in the invoice PDF,\nthe Invoice Details page, and in the invoice email. You can also select **Yes**\nunder **Include tax in price**, then check the **Display tax-exclusive prices**\noption in the **Items Options** dialog of the **Items** section. This excludes\ntax in prices in the invoice PDF, but includes tax on the Invoice Details page\nand in the email. If you’re adding tax rates manually for a business, you can\neither set **Include tax in price** to **No**, or set **Include tax in price**\nto **Yes** and check **Display tax-exclusive prices** in the **Items Options**\ndialog. The second approach includes tax on the Invoice Details page and in the\nemail, but not in the invoice PDF.\n\n2​​If a transaction isn’t subject to tax, you must state the reason for not\napplying it. For example, if the tax liability shifts to your customer (that is,\nyour customer now has to account for tax), you must mention it as a “reverse\ncharge” on the invoice. In the case of an EU business selling to another EU\nbusiness, you must mention “zero-rated intra-Community supply.\" To include these\nreferences in your invoice, add a custom field under **Additional options** in\nthe [Invoice Editor](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/invoices/create).\n\n## Facilitate customer payment\n\nAfter you set up your invoices to meet European regulations and requirements,\nfacilitate customer payment by:\n\n- Adding the most popular European payment methods. Lower your costs for B2B and\nB2C invoices by accepting bank methods such as [SEPA Direct\nDebit](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sepa-debit) or [Bacs Direct\nDebit](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/bacs-debit), or offer\n[Klarna](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/klarna) for B2C invoices to give your\ncustomers more flexible payment options, such as [Pay in\n3](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/klarna#payment-options) installments.\n- Using the [Hosted Invoice\nPage](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/hosted-invoice-page).\n- Picking the right net terms.\n- [Localizing your\nInvoice](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/customize#customer-language) to the\nlanguage of your customer.\n\n#### Caution\n\nStripe Invoicing doesn’t integrate with the Italian government’s e-invoicing\nplatform.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Customize invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/customize)\n- [Payment methods](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/payment-methods)\n- [Account tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/taxes/account-tax-ids)\n- [Tax rates and IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/taxes/tax-rates)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Invoice template](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/invoice)\n- [Public business information](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public)\n- [account settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/account)\n- [Stripe Tax](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/invoicing)\n- [new tax rate](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/tax-rates)\n- [Invoice Editor](https://dashboard.stripe.com/invoices/create)\n- [Invoice Editor](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/invoices/create)\n- [SEPA Direct Debit](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sepa-debit)\n- [Bacs Direct\nDebit](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/bacs-debit)\n- [Klarna](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/klarna)\n- [Pay in 3](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/klarna#payment-options)\n- [Hosted Invoice Page](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/hosted-invoice-page)\n- [Localizing your\nInvoice](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/customize#customer-language)\n- [Customize invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/customize)\n- [Payment methods](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/payment-methods)\n- [Account tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/taxes/account-tax-ids)\n- [Tax rates and IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/taxes/tax-rates)",
