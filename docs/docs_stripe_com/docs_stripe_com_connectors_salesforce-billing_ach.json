The Payment Center flow\ncharges the payment method immediately, but Stripe requires an added\nverification step when using a bank account for ACH payments. Because of this\nincompatibility, adding an ACH payment method from this screen will always fail.\n\n!\n\nCreating ACH payment methods in the Payment Center UI will always fail\n\nUse the [New Payment Method\nACH](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/salesforce-billing/configuration#add-an-ach-payment-method-button-to-the-related-list-on-account-objects)\nflow directly from the **Payment Method Related List** on the **Account** within\nSalesforce instead.\n\n## Links\n\n- [New Payment Method\nACH](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/salesforce-billing/configuration#add-an-ach-payment-method-button-to-the-related-list-on-account-objects)",
