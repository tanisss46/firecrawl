  "content": "# Tax examples\n\n## Learn about revenue recognition with tax examples.\n\nUnless stated otherwise, these tax examples assume that revenue recognition\ntakes place on a per-day basis.\n\n## Tax exempt\n\nYour [customers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers) can have a [tax\nexemption\nstatus](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/taxes/tax-rates#tax-exempt-and-reverse-charge)\nof either `exempt` or `reverse`. No tax is calculated on the invoice in either\ncase.\n\nIn this example, a customer with a tax exemption status of `reverse` starts a\nmonthly subscription on January 1 at 00:00:00 UTC. It costs 31 USD per month and\nhas a tax-inclusive rate of 10%. Because the customer is tax exempt, the total\namount due is 27.90 USD. The subscription generates an invoice, the invoice\nfinalizes, and the customer pays the invoice on the same day. Your journal entry\nwould look like this:\n\nAccountDebitCreditRevenue+27.90Cash+27.90\n## Tax-inclusive rate on invoice items\n\nAn invoice item can include a tax-inclusive rate. When you add an invoice item\nto an invoice, it can use the same accounting period or a different accounting\nperiod from its creation date.\n\n### Same accounting period\n\nIn this example, a customer starts a service for a period of 1 month on January\n1 at 00:00:00 UTC. The total amount due is 34.10 USD and has a tax-inclusive\nrate of 10%. You add the invoice item to an invoice on January 1, the invoice\nfinalizes, and the customer pays the invoice on the same day. Your journal entry\nwould look like this:\n\nAccountDebitCreditRevenue+31.00Cash+34.10TaxLiability+3.10\n### Different accounting period\n\nIn this example, a customer starts a service for a 3 month period on January 1\nat 00:00:00 UTC. The total amount due is 100.00 USD and has a tax-inclusive rate\nof 10%. You add the invoice item to an invoice on March 1, the invoice\nfinalizes, and the customer pays the invoice on the same day. Your journal entry\nwould look like this:\n\nAccountJanFebMarRevenue-34.10-30.80-31.00Cash+100.00TaxLiability-10.00UnbilledAccountsReceivable+34.10+30.80-64.90UnbilledVoids+5.90\n## Tax liability\n\nInvoices and invoice line items can be [assigned tax\nrates](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/taxes/tax-rates). When tax rates are\nassigned, the Revenue Recognition reports can compute tax liability.\n\nBelow is an example using an exclusive tax rate with the following assumptions:\n\n- On January 1, at 00:00:00 UTC, a customer starts a monthly subscription that\ncosts 31 USD with an exclusive tax rate of 10%. The total due amount is 34.10\nUSD.\n- The subscription generates an invoice.\n- The invoice finalizes and is paid on the same day.\nAccountJanRevenue+31.00Cash+34.10TaxLiability+3.10\nBelow is an example using an inclusive tax rate with the following assumptions:\n\n- On January 1, at 00:00:00 UTC, a customer starts a monthly subscription that\ncosts 31 USD with an inclusive tax rate of 10%.
