Learn more about how the [monitoring tool\nworks](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/monitoring).\n\nRemote sellers must register to collect and remit tax in Hawaii when, in the\nprevious or current calendar year, they meet or exceed one of the following:\n\n- A sales threshold of 100,000 USD\n- A volume threshold of 200 transactions\n\nThe threshold includes gross sales, including marketplace sales.\n\n## Register to collect tax\n\nRegister for sales tax in Hawaii at the [tax\nauthority](https://tax.hawaii.gov/). Read more about registering for [sales tax\nin the US in our\nguide](https://stripe.com/guides/sales-tax-registration-process-us). You can\nalso use [Stripe to\nregister](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/use-stripe-to-register) on your behalf.\n\nAfter you’ve registered to collect tax in Hawaii, go to\n[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations?location=us-hi)\nto add your registrations to Stripe in the Dashboard. This turns on tax\ncalculation and collection in Stripe for your transactions in Hawaii.\n\nLearn [how to add your\nregistration](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/registering#track-your-registrations-in-the-tax-dashboard)\nin the Dashboard.\n\n## How we calculate taxes\n\nStripe calculates the taxes that apply to your customer’s location.\n\nInstead of a traditional sales tax paid by consumers, Hawaii has a tax on\nbusinesses called General Excise Tax (GET). Businesses can recover GET by\npassing it on to their customers. Businesses generally display GET as a separate\nitem on receipts, but they’re not required to do so.\n\nBecause a business must pay GET on the entire amount paid by a customer, it also\nowes GET on any GET reimbursement it collects from customers. To cover that\nadditional tax amount, Hawaii allows businesses to pass GET on to customers at a\nhigher rate than the base GET rate. Stripe Tax only supports the maximum pass-on\nrate, which fully covers a business’ GET liability.\n\nFor example:\n\nA product sells for 100 USD and is subject to 4% GET, so the seller owes 4 USD\nGET. If the seller passes that on to the customer and collects 104 USD, the\nentire amount is subject to 4% GET. As a result, the seller’s GET liability\nbecomes 4.16 USD.\n\nThe seller can recover the entire GET amount from the customer by instead using\nthe maximum pass-on rate, which for a 4% GET rate is 4.166%. That lets the\nseller charge the customer 4.166%, or 4.16 USD, which covers their entire GET\nliability. GET rates can vary by county and by business type. To learn more\nabout GET and the maximum pass-on rates, see [Hawaii’s tax facts\npage](https://files.hawaii.gov/tax/legal/taxfacts/tf2015-37-1.pdf).\n\n## Report and file your taxes\n\nStripe provides reports of your completed tax transactions. Go to\n[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations) to access these\nreports.\n\n### Exports\n\nThe tax transaction data export provides a comprehensive and aggregated view of\ntransactions by location, including a breakdown of individual tax amounts. Learn\nmore about [tax reporting exports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports#exports).\n\n### Location reports\n\n[Location reports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports#us-location-reports)\noffer a summary of transaction and refund data for specific US locations and\nalign with Hawaii filing requirements. You have the option to report on an\nannual, semiannual, quarterly, or monthly basis.\n\nReporting-specific considerations:\n\n- In Hawaii, wholesalers are required to identify wholesale sales because\nthey’re subject to a lower tax rate instead of being completely exempt. You\nwon’t see a location report for Hawaii if you have any customer-exempt\ntransactions. Use the [exports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports#exports)\ninstead for a detailed tax breakdown of each transaction.\n\n### Filing\n\nStripe Tax has filing partners—Taxually, Marosa, and Hands-off Sales Tax\n(HOST)—to help automate your tax filing. These partners automatically sync your\ntax transaction data in real time, eliminating the need for manual data entry or\nfile transfers.
