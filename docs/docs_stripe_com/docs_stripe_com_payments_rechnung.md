# Payment on invoicePrivate preview

## Learn how to offer payment on invoice, a buy now, pay later payment option that allows you to get paid up front.

Payment on invoice is a popular way for customers to buy now and pay later in
Germany. When you accept payments on invoice with Stripe, as soon as a payment
is approved we add the full payment amount, minus fees, to your Stripe balance.
We then send an invoice reflecting your branding to the customer. They must pay
the invoice within 14 days.

To pay using payment on invoice, a buyer enters their details (including name,
email, address, and date of birth). Using this data, a risk assessment is
carried out and, if approved by the assessment, the payment is authorized on
Stripe. The payment is then approved or declined based on the risk assessment
result and you receive an [immediate
notification](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#payment-notification)
of the payment’s success or failure.
