To get started with one of our hosted UIs, follow a quickstart:\n\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart): Our prebuilt, hosted\ncheckout page.\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart): Our drop-in UI\ncomponents.\n\n### Other payment products\n\nThe following Stripe products also let you add Przelewy24 from the Dashboard:\n\n- [Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/no-code-guide)\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n\nIf your integration requires manually listing payment methods, learn how to\n[manually configure Przelewy24 as a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/p24/accept-a-payment).\n\n## Prohibited business categories\n\nIn addition to the industry and business categories listed in [Prohibited and\nrestricted businesses](https://stripe.com/restricted-businesses), Przelewy24\nprohibits the following business categories:\n\n- Dropshipping businesses\n- Businesses selling online training\n\nTo learn more about P24 eligibility for your account, see your [Payment methods\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) in the\nDashboard.\n\n## Additional requirements\n\nPrzelewy24 requires that your website or app be publicly available and contain\nthe following information:\n\n- A list of the products and services you sell and their prices\n- Your company’s legal details, including: address, tax number, and registration\nnumber\n- Links to your refund policy and privacy policies\n\nPrzelewy24 has the right to suspend or terminate your use of Przelewy24 for\nbreaching the prohibited business categories or failing to meet the additional\nrequirements listed above.\n\n## Disputes\n\nThe risk of fraud or unrecognized payments is low because the customer must\nauthenticate the payment with their bank. As a result, you won’t have disputes\nthat turn into chargebacks, with funds withdrawn from your Stripe account.\n\n## Refunds\n\nPayments made with Przelewy24 can only be submitted for refund within 180 days\nfrom the date of the original charge. After 180 days, it is no longer possible\nto refund the charge.\n\n## Links\n\n- [pricing details](https://stripe.com/pricing/local-payment-methods)\n- [authenticate a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#customer-actions)\n- [immediate\nnotification](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#payment-notification)\n- [No](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/p24#disputed-payments)\n- [Yes / Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/p24#refunds)\n- [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods)\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart)\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart)\n- [Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/no-code-guide)\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n- [manually configure Przelewy24 as a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/p24/accept-a-payment)\n- [Prohibited and restricted\nbusinesses](https://stripe.com/restricted-businesses)",
