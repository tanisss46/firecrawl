  "content": "# Changing a subscription to a new plan with a trial now extends the trial periodBreaking changes\n\n## What’s new\n\nWhen changing the plan on a subscription to a new plan with a trial (together\nwith `trial_from_plan=true`), the new plan’s full trial period is now added to\nthe subscription, without subtracting already-used time from previous trials.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis change allows you to apply a new plan’s full trial period to a subscription\nwhen changing plans, regardless of previous trial usage. It provides more\nflexibility in subscription management, enabling extended trial periods even for\ncustomers who have already had trials.\n\n## Upgrade\n\n- [View your current API\nversion](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#view-your-api-version-and-the-latest-available-upgrade-in-workbench)\nin Workbench.\n- If you use an SDK, upgrade to the corresponding SDK version for this API\nversion.- If you don’t use an SDK, update your [API\nrequests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/versioning) to include `Stripe-Version:\n2018-05-21`\n- Upgrade the API version used for [webhook\nendpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks/versioning).\n- [Test your integration](https://docs.stripe.com/testing) against the new\nversion.\n- If you use Connect, [test your Connect\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/testing).\n- In Workbench, [perform the\nupgrade](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#perform-the-upgrade).
