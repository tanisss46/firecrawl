# Security at Stripe

## Learn how Stripe handles security.

#### PCI 4.0 released

[PCI DSS
v4.0](https://docs-prv.pcisecuritystandards.org/PCI%20DSS/Standard/PCI-DSS-v3-2-1-to-v4-0-Summary-of-Changes-r2.pdf)
replaces v3.2.1 effective March 31, 2024. Stripe can help you understand how the
requirements for demonstrating your compliance might change. Read our [Guide to
PCI compliance](https://stripe.com/ie/guides/pci-compliance) to get started.

Our users trust Stripe with their sensitive data and rely on us to be good
custodians of their customers’ data as well. As a payments infrastructure
company, our security posture continually evolves to meet the rigorous standards
of the global financial industry.

## Standards and regulations compliance

Stripe uses best-in-class security practices to maintain a high level of
security.

### PCI-certified

A PCI-certified auditor evaluated Stripe and certified us to [PCI Service
Provider Level 1](https://usa.visa.com/splisting/splistinglearnmore.html). This
is the most stringent level of certification available in the payments industry.
This audit includes both Stripe’s Card Data Vault (CDV) and the secure software
development of our integration code.

We provide our users with features to automate some aspects of PCI compliance.

- We analyze the user’s integration method and dynamically inform them of which
PCI validation form to use.
- If a user integrates with Stripe Elements, Checkout, Terminal SDKs, or our
mobile libraries, we provide assistance in completing their PCI validation form
([Self-Assessment Questionnaire
A](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pci_security/completing_self_assessment))
in the Dashboard.
- We publish a [PCI Compliance Guide](https://stripe.com/guides/pci-compliance)
to help educate our users about PCI compliance and how Stripe can help.

### System and Organization Controls (SOC) reports

Stripe’s systems, processes, and controls are regularly audited as part of our
SOC 1 and SOC 2 compliance programs. SOC 1 and SOC 2 Type II reports are
produced annually and can be provided upon request.

The Auditing Standards Board of the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants’ ([AICPA](https://www.aicpa.org/)) Trust Service Criteria (TSC)
developed the SOC 3 report. Stripe’s SOC 3 is a public report of internal
controls over security, availability, and confidentiality. [View our recent SOC
3
report](https://d37ugbyn3rpeym.cloudfront.net/docs/security/2023-Stripe-Payment-Processing-SOC3.pdf).

### EMVCo standard for card terminals

Stripe Terminal is certified to the [EMVCo Level 1 and
2](https://www.emvco.com/approved-products/?search_bar_keywords=bbpos&tax%5Bapproved-products_categories%5D%5B90%5D%5B%5D=94%2C95%2C96%2C97%2C99)
standards of EMV® Specifications for card and terminal security and
interoperability. Terminal is also certified to the [PCI Payment Application
Data Security Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PA-DSS) (PA-DSS)—the
global security standard that aims to prevent payment applications developed for
third parties from storing prohibited secure data.

### NIST Cybersecurity Framework

Stripe’s suite of information security policies and their overarching design are
aligned with the [NIST Cybersecurity
Framework](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/new-framework). Our security
practices meet the standards of our enterprise customers who must provide secure
products like on-demand cloud computing and storage platforms (for example,
DigitalOcean and Slack).

### Privacy and data protection

Stripe’s privacy practices comply with CBPR and PRP systems as evidenced by the
CBPR and PRP certifications Stripe has obtained. To view the status of our
certifications, please click

## Stripe product securement

Security is one of Stripe’s guiding principles for all our product design and
infrastructure decisions. We offer a range of features to help our users better
protect their Stripe data.

### Sensitive action authentication

The Stripe Dashboard supports several forms of [multi-factor
authentication](https://support.stripe.com/questions/enable-two-step-authentication)
(MFA) including:
[SMS](https://support.stripe.com/questions/enable-two-step-authentication-via-text-messaging),
[time-based one-time password
algorithm](https://support.stripe.com/questions/enable-two-step-authentication-using-a-mobile-app)
(TOTP), [hardware security
keys](https://support.stripe.com/questions/set-up-a-hardware-security-key-for-two-step-authentication),
and [passkeys](https://support.stripe.com/questions/sign-in-using-a-passkey). We
also support [single sign-on](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/sso)
through Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0, allowing customers to
mandate sign-in requirements, configure access control, and instantly onboard
team members through Just-in-Time account provisioning.

Support requests from users must be authenticated by sending the request from
the Dashboard (after login) or by verifying account access before a support
response is proffered. By requiring authentication, we minimize the risk of
providing any information to non-authorized people.

### Access restriction and auditing

From the Dashboard, users can assign different detailed
[roles](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/teams) to enable
least-privilege access for their employees, and create [restricted access
keys](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#limit-access) to reduce the security and
reliability risk of API key exposure.

Users can also view audit logs of important account changes and activity in
their [security history](https://dashboard.stripe.com/security_history). These
audit logs contain records of sensitive account activity, like logging in or
changing bank account information. We monitor logins and note:

- If they’re from the same or usual devices
- If they’re from consistent IP addresses
- Failed attempts

Users can export historical information from the logs. For time-sensitive
activities, such as logins from unknown IPs and devices, we send automatic
notifications so that logs don’t need to be reviewed manually.

### HTTPS and HSTS for secure connections

We mandate the use of HTTPS for all services using
[TLS](https://docs.stripe.com/security/guide#tls) (SSL), including our public
website and the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/dashboard). We
regularly audit the details of our implementation, including the certificates we
serve, the certificate authorities we use, and the ciphers we support. We use
[HSTS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security) to make sure
that browsers interact with Stripe only over HTTPS. Stripe is also on the HSTS
preloaded lists for all modern major browsers.

All server-to-sever communication is encrypted using mutual transport layer
security (mTLS) and Stripe has dedicated [PGP
keys](https://docs.stripe.com/security/python-client-pgp-key) for users to
encrypt communications with Stripe, or verify signed messages they receive from
Stripe. Our systems automatically block requests made using older, less secure
versions of TLS, [requiring use of at least TLS
1.2](https://stripe.com/blog/completing-tls-upgrade).

The [stripe.com](https://stripe.com/) domain, including the Dashboard and API
subdomains, are on the [top
domains](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/605062) list
for Chrome, providing extra protection against homoglyph attacks. This makes it
harder to create fake pages that look like stripe.com in Chrome (for example,
[strípe.com](https://xn--strpe-1sa.com/)), which renders as punycode
([xn–strpe-1sa.com](https://xn--strpe-1sa.com/)), in turn making it harder for
Stripe credentials to be phished.

### Proactive internet monitoring

We proactively scan the internet for our merchants’ API keys. If we find a
compromised key, we take appropriate action, advising the user to roll their API
key. We use the GitHub Token Scanner to alert us when a user’s API keys have
been leaked on GitHub. If we find external phishing pages that might catch our
users, we work proactively with our vendors to take those down and report them
to Google Safe Browsing.

## Infrastructure safeguards

Our security teams test our infrastructure regularly by scanning for
vulnerabilities and conducting penetration tests and red team exercises. We hire
industry-leading security companies to perform third-party scans of our systems,
and we immediately address their findings. Our servers are frequently and
automatically replaced to maintain server health and discard stale connections
or resources. Server operating systems are upgraded well in advance of their
security end of life (EOL) date.

### Dedicated card technology

Stripe encrypts sensitive data both in transit and at rest. Stripe’s
infrastructure for storing, decrypting, and transmitting primary account numbers
(PANs), such as credit card numbers, runs in a separate hosting infrastructure,
and doesn’t share any credentials with the rest of our services. A dedicated
team manages our CDV in an isolated Amazon Web Services (AWS) environment that’s
separate from the rest of Stripe’s infrastructure. Access to this separate
environment is restricted to a small number of specially trained engineers and
access is reviewed quarterly.

All card numbers are encrypted at rest with AES-256. Decryption keys are stored
on separate machines. We tokenize PANs internally, isolating raw numbers from
the rest of our infrastructure. None of Stripe’s internal servers and daemons
can obtain plain text card numbers but can request that cards are sent to a
service provider on a static allowlist. Stripe’s infrastructure for storing,
decrypting, and transmitting card numbers runs in a separate hosting
environment, and doesn’t share any credentials with Stripe’s primary services
including our API and website. It’s not just PANs that are tokenized this way;
we treat other sensitive data, like bank account information, in a similar way.

### Corporate technology

Stripe takes a zero-trust approach to employee access management. Employees are
authenticated leveraging SSO, two-factor authentication (2FA) using a
hardware-based token, and mTLS through a cryptographic certificate on
Stripe-issued machines. After connecting to the network, sensitive internal
systems and those outside the scope of the employee’s standard work require
additional access permissions.

We monitor audit logs to detect abnormalities and watch for intrusions and
suspicious activity, and also monitor changes to sensitive files in our code
base. All of Stripe’s code goes through multiparty review and automated testing.
Code changes are recorded in an immutable, tamper-evident log. We constantly
collect information about Stripe-issued laptops to monitor for malicious
processes, connections to fraudulent domains, and intruder activity. We have a
comprehensive process for allowlisting permitted software on employee laptops,
preventing the installation of non-approved applications.

## Security posture maintenance

Our developers work with security experts early in a project’s life cycle. As
part of our Security Review process, security experts develop threat models and
trust boundaries that help guide the implementation of the project. Developers
use this same process to make changes to sensitive pieces of code.

### Dedicated experts on-call

We have a number of dedicated security teams that specialize in different areas
of security, including infrastructure, operations, privacy, users, and
applications. Security experts are available 24/7 through on-call rotations.
We’re focused on constantly raising the bar on best practices to minimize
cybersecurity risks.

### Security is every Stripe employee’s job

We require every Stripe employee to complete security education annually, and we
provide secure software development training to Stripe engineers. We run
internal phishing campaigns to test everyone at Stripe on recognizing phishing
attempts and flagging them to the appropriate security team.

### Managing access control

We have a formal process for granting access to systems and information; we
regularly review and automatically remove inactive access. Actions within the
most sensitive areas of the infrastructure need a human review. To enable best
practices for access control, our security experts build primitives to assist
Stripe teams in implementing the principle of least privilege. To minimize our
exposure, we have a data retention policy that minimizes the data we keep while
complying with regulatory and business requirements.

### Vulnerability disclosure and reward program

We maintain a vulnerability disclosure and reward (“bug bounty”) program that
compensates independent security researchers who help us keep our users safe. By
submitting a security bug or vulnerability to Stripe through
[HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/stripe), you acknowledge that you’ve read and
agreed to the [program terms and conditions](https://hackerone.com/stripe).
Refer to our policy on HackerOne for more information on how to participate in
our bug bounty program.
