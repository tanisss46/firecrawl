  "content": "# Get started with products and prices\n\n## Start modeling your business on Stripe with products and prices.\n\n[Products](https://docs.stripe.com/api/products) and\n[Prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices) are core resources for several\nStripe integrations, including [Checkout\nSessions](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions), [Payment\nLinks](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links),\n[Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing) and\n[Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing).\n\nFirst, make sure you understand the overall goals of your integration\nproject-make your design decisions before you start building it. For example, if\nyou’re building a\n[Subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating)\nintegration, read [designing an\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/designing-integration)\nto learn more about design decisions and [pricing\nmodels](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models) to understand\nhow to translate your business model on Stripe.\n\nNext, decide whether you need to create new products and prices in Stripe or\nimport an existing product catalog from another system into Stripe. [Create new\nproducts and\nprices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/getting-started#create-products-prices)\nin the Dashboard if your product catalog is small or you don’t want to use code.\nIf you have a very large product catalog, use the\n[Products](https://docs.stripe.com/api/products) API to\n[import](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/getting-started#import-products-prices)\nyour catalog programmatically.\n\nYou’re responsible for handling fulfillment of physical or digital products.\n\n## Multiple products and prices\n\nYou can create as many products as you need to represent your product catalog.\nYou can also create multiple prices for each product. Whether you should create\nmultiple products as opposed to multiple prices depends on several factors.\nGenerally, however, you want to:\n\n- Create multiple prices for a single product if you’re selling the same item at\ndifferent price points. For example, if you offer a subscription tier at monthly\nand yearly rates, create one product for the tier and one price for the monthly\nrate and another for the yearly rate. See an example of this for a\n[good-better-best flat rate pricing\nmodel](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models#flat-rate). (If\nyou’re selling the same item in different currencies, then instead of creating\nmultiple prices, create a single [multi-currency\nPrice](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models#multicurrency).)\n- Create multiple products if the items require different provisioning or\nfulfillment in your application. In the\n[good-better-best](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models#flat-rate)\nmodel, for example, you would create a different product for each tier.\nSimilarly, if you have different versions of a product, like different colors or\nsizes of a t-shirt, you would create a product for each version.\n\n### Test mode\n\nYou can copy products from test mode to live mode so that you don’t need to\nrecreate them. Prices associated with the product are also copied over. In the\nProduct detail view in the Dashboard, click ** to live mode** in the upper\nright corner.\n\nYou can only copy test products to live mode once. If you make updates to the\ntest product after the copy, the live product won’t reflect the changes.\n\n## Create products and prices\n\nUsing the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/products) is the easiest way\nto create new products and prices. If you want to use the API, see the guide for\n[managing products and\nprices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/manage-prices); this section\nonly describes the Dashboard steps.\n\n### Create a product\n\nTo create a product in the Dashboard:\n\n- Go to **More** > **Product catalog**.\n- Click **+Add product**.\n- Enter the **Name** of your product.\n- *(Optional)* Add a **Description**. The description appears at checkout, on\nthe [customer portal](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management), and in\n[quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/quotes).\n- *(Optional)* Add an **Image** of your product. Use a JPEG, PNG, or WEBP file\nthat’s smaller than 2MB. The image appears at checkout.\n- *(Optional)* If you’re using [Stripe Tax](https://docs.stripe.com/tax), select\na **Tax code** for your product. See [tax\ncodes](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes) for more information about the\nappropriate category for your product.\n- *(Optional)* Enter a **Statement descriptor**. This descriptor overrides any\naccount descriptors for recurring payments. Choose something that your customers\nwould recognize on a bank statement.\n- *(Optional)* Enter a **Unit label**. This describes how you sell your product.\nFor example, if you charge by the seat, enter “seat” so the line item includes\n“per seat” for the price. Unit labels appear at checkout, and in invoices,\nreceipts, and the [customer\nportal](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/customer-portal).\n\nTo save a product in the Dashboard, you must also add at least one price. You\ncan also create multiple prices for a product. See [create a\nprice](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/getting-started#create-price) to\nlearn more.\n\n### Create a price\n\nTo create a price in the Dashboard, you have to [create a\nproduct](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/getting-started#create-product)\nfirst. You can create multiple prices for a product.\n\n- Select a **Pricing model**. For more details about recurring pricing models,\nread the [pricing model\nguide](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models).\n\n- **Flat-rate pricing**: Charge the same price for each unit. If you use this\noption, select **One time** or **Recurring**.\n- **Package pricing**: Charge by the package, or group of units, such as\ncharging 25 USD for every 5 units. Purchases are rounded up by default, so a\ncustomer buying 8 units pays 50 USD.\n- **Graduated pricing**: Use pricing tiers that might result in a different\nprice for some units in an order. For example, you might charge 10 USD per unit\nfor the first 100 units and then 5 USD per unit for the next 50. If you use this\noption, select the currency for the price and fill in the tier table.\n- **Volume pricing**: Charge the same price for each unit based on the total\nnumber of units sold. For example, you might charge 10 USD per unit for 50\nunits, and 7 USD per unit for 100 units. If you use this option, select the\ncurrency for the price and fill in the tier table.\n- **Customer chooses price**: Let the payer decide on the amount to pay for your\nproduct, service, or cause. **Customer chooses price** is only compatible with\nCheckout and Payment Links.\n- **Usage-based pricing**: Charge your customers based on how much of your\nservice they use during the billing cycle.\n- *(Optional)* If you’re selling in multiple currencies, click **Add another\ncurrency** to set how much to charge in each currency.\n- Select a **Billing period** for recurring prices. You can add a custom period\nif none of the drop-down options are what you want.\n- Select whether to **Include tax in price**. Learn more about [taxes and\nsubscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/taxes).\n- *(Optional)* Enter a **Price description**. Customers don’t see this\ndescription.\n- Click **Create price** to save the price. You can [edit the\nprice](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/getting-started#edit-price)\nlater.\n\n## Import products and prices\n\nIf you have a very large product catalog, use the\n[Products](https://docs.stripe.com/api/products) API to import your catalog\nprogrammatically. If you’re importing your product catalog to Stripe, you can\nuse anything as your starting data source, like a product management system or\nCSV file.\n\nUse the [Products](https://docs.stripe.com/api/products) API to create a product\nin Stripe for each product in your system. To map products in your system to\nproducts in Stripe, assign each product that you import a unique\n[id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/products/create#create_product-id). For each\nproduct, use the [Prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices) API to make a\ncorresponding price. Make sure to store the `id` of the newly created price.\nYou’ll need to pass this `id` when you [use the products and\nprices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/getting-started#use-products-and-prices)\nin your integration.\n\nConfirm the import by checking the\n[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/products) or using the API to [list all\nproducts](https://docs.stripe.com/api/products/list).\n\n### Deleting prices\n\nDuring development, you might need to run this script multiple times for\ntesting. If you use the same Product ID, you’ll see an error stating that a\nProduct with that ID already exists. If you haven’t used the Product yet, you\ncan delete it using the Stripe Dashboard:\n\n- Go to the Products [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/products) and find\nyour Product.\n- In the **Pricing** section, click the overflow menu () next to the Price and\nselect **Delete Price**.\n- Click the overflow menu () at the top of the page, and select **Delete\nProduct**.\n\n### Synchronize products and prices\n\nYou’ll likely need to run through an import more than once. You can create a\nscript to test the import and, if you want to, synch your original data source\nwith Stripe. To make your script idempotent and resilient to errors, you can\nsafely try to create the product first, then update it if the product already\nexists.\n\nTo keep your product catalog synchronized with Stripe, use webhooks or other\nmechanisms to trigger product updates in Stripe. To [update a\nproduct](https://docs.stripe.com/api/products/update) programmatically, use the\nfollowing pattern.\n\nFirst, find the existing price associated with the product with [list all\nprices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/list) API to make sure the price\nstill matches your data source. Each product should have exactly one active\nprice.\n\n```\ncurl -G https://api.stripe.com/v1/prices \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d product={{PRODUCT_ID}} \\\n -d active=true\n```\n\nNext, check whether the decimal amount of the price has changed. The\n`unit_amount_decimal`\n[field](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/object#price_object-unit_amount_decimal)\ndisplays the unit amount in cents.\n\nIf the amount doesn’t match, you have to create a new price. When you [create a\nnew price](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/create), specify the `product` ID\nof the original product, the `currency`, and the updated `unit_amount` price.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/prices \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d product={{PRODUCT_ID}} \\\n -d unit_amount=2000 \\\n -d currency=usd\n```\n\nFinally, [update the old price](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/update) to\nmark it as `active=false`.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/prices/{{PRICE_ID}} \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d active=false\n```\n\n## Use products and prices\n\nNow that you have products and prices in Stripe, you can use them in an\nintegration.\n\nStripe CheckoutPayment LinksSubscriptionsQuotesInvoices\nSpecify the Price ID when you create a Checkout Session.\n\n- If you’re using one-time prices, see [how to create a Checkout\nSession](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web&ui=stripe-hosted#redirect-customers)\nwhen accepting a payment.\n- If you’re creating Subscriptions, see [how to create a Checkout\nSession](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/build-subscriptions?ui=stripe-hosted#create-session)\nwhen building a subscription integration.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Products](https://docs.stripe.com/api/products)\n- [Prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices)\n- [Checkout Sessions](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions)\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n- [Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing)\n- [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing)\n- [Subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating)\n- [designing an\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/designing-integration)\n- [pricing models](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models)\n- [good-better-best flat rate pricing\nmodel](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models#flat-rate)\n- [multi-currency\nPrice](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models#multicurrency)\n- [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/products)\n- [managing products and\nprices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/manage-prices)\n- [customer portal](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management)\n- [quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/quotes)\n- [Stripe Tax](https://docs.stripe.com/tax)\n- [tax codes](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes)\n- [customer\nportal](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/customer-portal)\n- [taxes and subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/taxes)\n- [id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/products/create#create_product-id)\n- [list all products](https://docs.stripe.com/api/products/list)\n- [update a product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/products/update)\n- [list all prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/list)\n-\n[field](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/object#price_object-unit_amount_decimal)\n- [create a new price](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/create)\n- [update the old price](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/update)\n- [how to create a Checkout\nSession](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web&ui=stripe-hosted#redirect-customers)\n- [how to create a Checkout\nSession](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/build-subscriptions?ui=stripe-hosted#create-session)",
