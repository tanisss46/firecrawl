# Use Stripe to register for sales tax

## Learn more about how Stripe can register for you.

Stripe can register with the local tax authorities on behalf of remote sellers
in the United States.

## Eligibility

Stripe can register on your behalf in the US in every state.

For the supported jurisdictions, Stripe can register on your behalf to collect
sales and use tax if your business meets the following additional eligibility
requirements:

- A remote (out-of-state) seller with no physical presence in the state
- A US-based business and US-based direct entity ownership
- A US bank account in states that charge [state
fees](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/use-stripe-to-register#pricing-and-state-fees)
or collect bank account details as part of the registration process
- The business hasn’t received a notice or set up an online account with the
jurisdiction
- No prior acquisitions of an existing business

## How to sign up

Under [Thresholds](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/thresholds) on the Tax page:

- Hover over the jurisdiction where you want to sign up and click **Add
registration**.
- Select **Register for me** to have Stripe complete your application.

Under [Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations) on the Tax
page:

- Click **Add registration**.
- Select the U.S. state you want to register in.
- Select **Register for me**.

## What to expect

### Gather information needed to register

Gather key business information such as address, EIN, contact and ID information
(for business owners and your business representative), and any state-specific
information such as previous year sales and the date you want your registration
to become effective.

### After you submit your application

One of Stripe’s tax experts completes your registration with the state in 30
days or less. December, January, and February are high-volume months for
registration and tax filings. Within those months registration takes 60 days or
less.

After we complete it, you receive a detailed confirmation email from our team of
tax experts containing a secure document link with relevant information about
your new tax registration. You can also view this in the
[Documents](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/documents) section of your
Stripe Dashboard.

Your new tax registration is automatically added to your Stripe Dashboard after
Stripe registers for you. If you are [set up to collect using Stripe
Tax](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/set-up), Stripe will then begin automatically
calculating tax in this jurisdiction according to your collection start date.

## Pricing and state fees

The following states charge a fee to all remote sellers who register to collect
tax. Because most states require ACH debit to process fees, your provided bank
account is debited for any state fees charged upon the initial registration
submission. The exact fee can vary slightly depending on your unique business
characteristics.

- Arizona: 12 USD state fee charged with registration plus 1-50 USD per local
jurisdiction, charged after you file and remit in a new local jurisdiction
- Colorado: 16 USD per location site plus a 50 USD deposit, refunded
automatically after you collect 50 USD in state sales tax
- Connecticut: 100 USD
- Hawaii: 20 USD
- Indiana: 25 USD
- Nevada: 15 USD plus a security deposit, which depends on your estimated sales
volume and is held by the state for a minimum of 3 years
- South Carolina: 50 USD
- Washington: 50 USD plus 5 USD per DBA (“doing business as," or trade name)
- West Virginia: 30 USD
- Wisconsin: 20 USD
- Wyoming: 60 USD

## When to register for tax collection

When you need to register to collect tax in the US as a remote seller, it’s
typically based on two primary factors:

### When you exceed an economic nexus threshold, based on sales or transaction count

In the US, you need to register as a remote seller after you meet the state’s
economic nexus threshold requirements. Check out the [US state tax
pages](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/united-states) or
[Thresholds](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/thresholds) in your Stripe
Dashboard to see how your payment volume stacks up against each jurisdiction’s
thresholds. Stripe also notifies you with email and Dashboard alerts after you
appear to have crossed a threshold based on your Stripe payment volume.

### Whether the jurisdiction provides a grace period to allow taxpayers more time to register after exceeding a threshold

## Late registration

If you’re late in registering to collect tax, you have two main options.

The first option is to register as soon as possible with a registration
effective date of when nexus was established in the jurisdiction, even if this
date is in the past, to reflect when you should have initially registered. Keep
in mind that the state will often require you to file overdue returns for
missing tax periods and back-pay any taxes along with any penalties and
interest. If you’re subject to penalties, most states offer penalty waivers that
can be filed to as for a reduction or elimination of any penalties owed.

The second option is to work with your tax advisor to file a Voluntary
Disclosure Agreement (VDA) in any jurisdictions where you’re late to register.
VDAs allow taxpayers to become compliant with the state and ask for leniency on
any overdue returns, taxes, and penalties. States might limit how far back you
have to pay previously owed taxes (for example, 3 years versus 5 years) or waive
any associated penalties. You can often do this anonymously through a third
party. This can be costly, so it’s important to consult your tax advisor and
weigh the pros and cons of both options.

## Registration considerations

### Your collection start date might be different from your registration date

- The registration effective date is the date you provided in your application
indicating when you need to register.
- The collection start date is the date Stripe began automatically calculating
and collecting tax for this jurisdiction.
- On the day our tax experts complete your registration, if your registration
effective date is:- In the future, your collection will be scheduled for that
same future date. This means both of these dates are the same.
- The same day, collection will start immediately.
- In the past, collection will start immediately. This means that your earlier
registration effective date and later collection start date in Stripe will
differ.

### Contact information for both states and Stripe

In your application, you provided contact information including an email
address. We recommended that this is an email that someone frequently checks and
that isn’t tied to any single individual. Stripe uses this contact information
in the event we need to contact you about your registration, and the states use
it on a long-term basis. In some states, this email address also becomes your
username.

### The Dashboard shows an “issue” status for a registration in progress

If you see an issue status next to your registration in process, check the email
address you provided as your contact information. One of our tax experts will
have reached out to you explaining what additional information is needed to
process your request.

### In-state registrations aren’t supported yet

We can only support remote (out-of-state) sellers with no physical presence in
the state at this time. Physical presence laws vary by state, but generally
include factors such as an office, storefront, employees, salespeople,
contractors, warehouses, inventory, or trade show attendance. Consult your tax
advisor if you’re unsure about whether you have physical presence in the state.

### Register with the taxing authorities before you can add this registration to your Stripe Dashboard

Adding a registration to the Stripe Dashboard doesn’t automatically register you
in that jurisdiction.

If Stripe registers on your behalf, one of our tax experts automatically adds
this new tax registration to your Stripe Dashboard with the correct effective
date, so you don’t need to take any further action to begin automatically
calculating tax.

### Viewing the signup option or reviewing an in-progress application

Registration applications are only accessible to users with `Owner` or `Admin`,
`Analyst`, or `Tax Analyst` account access to ensure the security of your data.
Other types of users won’t see the option to sign up or review an in-progress
application

The [sign-up
option](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/use-stripe-to-register#how-to-sign-up) is
limited to users who meet the [eligibility
criteria](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/use-stripe-to-register#eligibility) based
on data available in Stripe. This information includes:

- US-based business information including a Federal Employer Identification
Number (FEIN)
- A US address,
- A US (+1) phone number
- A Social Security Number (SSN) for your business representative and direct
individual business owners with 10% or more ownership.

### Filing assistance post-registration

Stripe doesn’t currently provide an in-house filing solution. See [tax
filing](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/filing) to learn more about our trusted
filing partners.

### Determining NAICS and SIC codes

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) and Standard
Industrial Classification (SIC) are two federal standardized code systems used
in the US to classify your primary business activity and industry. Certain state
jurisdictions use NAICS while others use SIC. If you don’t yet know the NAICS or
SIC code for your business, here’s how you can determine it:

- You can start by searching for an [NAICS code
here](https://www.naics.com/search/). We recommend doing this first, as NAICS
codes typically offer a bit more granularity. After you identify the proper
NAICS code, you can enter it in the [NAICS
column](https://www.naics.com/naics-to-sic-crosswalk-2/) to see the possible
corresponding SIC codes.
- Alternatively, you can search for a [SIC
code](https://www.naics.com/everything-sic/) here and then enter it in the [SIC
column](https://www.naics.com/naics-to-sic-crosswalk-2/) to see the possible
corresponding NAICS codes.

### Editing or canceling your registration application

If your registration application is incomplete (you haven’t submitted it yet),
you can edit or cancel it in the Dashboard by clicking the overflow menu () next
to your incomplete registration on the
[Thresholds](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/thresholds) tab or on the relevant
jurisdiction page in the Dashboard.

If you’ve already submitted your registration, you can request to edit or cancel
your application by contacting support.
