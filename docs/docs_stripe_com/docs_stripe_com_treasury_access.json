  "content": "# Get started with API access to Treasury and Issuing\n\n## Immediately access test mode to experiment before going live.\n\nYou can use Stripe Treasury and Issuing in test mode to see what functionality\nyou want to enable in your live integration.\n\n## Get test mode access to Treasury and Issuing\n\nEnable your Stripe account to request `issuing` and `treasury` capabilities on\nconnected accounts.\n\n[Activate Test Mode in the\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/setup/treasury/activate?a=1)\n\nClick **Activate Test Mode in the Dashboard**. Then, from the Dashboard, click\n**Get started** > **Enable Test mode**.\n\n#### Note\n\nYou must be an [account\nadministrator](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/teams/roles) to\ncomplete the Treasury onboarding steps for a platform.\n\n## Start with test mode\n\nThere are a few ways to start testing the Issuing and Treasury APIs.\n\n### Test with the Issuing and Treasury sample application\n\nUse the [Issuing and Treasury sample\napplication](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/examples/sample-app) to onboard\nyour first test mode connected account, create a financial account and card, and\nmake test transactions.\n\n### Test from the Dashboard\n\nYou must use the API or sample app to create financial accounts and cards linked\nto financial accounts. After you create a financial account, you can use the\nDashboard to view activity, copy routing and account numbers, and move funds\nfrom your platform Treasury balance into the financial account. After you create\na card, you can use the Dashboard to make test authorizations. See [Use the\nDashboard for Issuing with\nconnect](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/connect#using-dashboard-issuing).\n\n### Test Treasury only (without Issuing)\n\nTo test Treasury without Issuing, request the `treasury` capability on a\nconnected account and don’t request `card_issuing`. When you activate test mode\nthrough the link above, it gives your platform the ability to request both\ncapabilities independently.\n\n### Confirm test mode is enabled\n\nTo confirm you’ve enabled Treasury and Issuing in test mode, click **Treasury**\nin the Dashboard to access the [Financial Accounts\npage](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/connect/financial-accounts). If you\ncan’t access Financial Accounts then you haven’t enabled access.\n\n## Configure your account to go live\n\nEnabling Treasury and Issuing through the link above lets you try out basic\nfunctionality in test mode. However, this is a temporary state, and after you’re\napproved for a [supported business use\ncase](https://support.stripe.com/questions/supported-business-use-cases-for-stripe-issuing),\nyour account loses access to any test mode objects you created in this mode,\nsuch as test financial accounts, cardholders and cards.\n\n[Speak to sales](https://go.stripe.global/treasury-inquiry) to get approved for\na supported business use case, and configure your account for live mode and\nongoing test mode access.\n\n#### Caution\n\nSpeak to sales before building a full API integration, because some\nfunctionality could change.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Issuing documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing)\n- [to connected\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/account-management/treasury-accounts-structure)\n- [Activate Test Mode in the\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/setup/treasury/activate?a=1)\n- [account\nadministrator](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/teams/roles)\n- [Issuing and Treasury sample\napplication](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/examples/sample-app)\n- [Use the Dashboard for Issuing with\nconnect](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/connect#using-dashboard-issuing)\n- [Financial Accounts\npage](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/connect/financial-accounts)\n- [supported business use\ncase](https://support.stripe.com/questions/supported-business-use-cases-for-stripe-issuing)\n- [Speak to sales](https://go.stripe.global/treasury-inquiry)",
