  "content": "# Payment methods\n\n## Learn about the supported payment methods for Invoicing.\n\nBy default, customers can pay [invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\nwith any of the payment methods that you’ve enabled in your [Invoice\ntemplate](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/invoice). In some\nsituations, there might be restrictions that prevent payment methods from being\nused for an invoice. For instance, a payment method might only operate in one\ncurrency or have limitations on the amount that can be paid. If there’s a\nlimitation on a payment method, Stripe won’t automatically select it for you.\n\n## Supported payment methods\n\nStripe Invoicing supports the following payment methods:\n\nPayment methodDescriptionCurrenciesBusiness locationLimitations[ACH Direct\nDebit](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/ach-direct-debit)Accept debit payments\nfrom customers with a US bank account using the Automated Clearing House (ACH)\npayments system operated by Nacha.USDUnited\nStatesNone[Affirm](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/affirm)Enable customers to\nsplit their payments over time while your business gets paid up front.CAD,\nUSDCanada, United StatesYou can only add this payment method to individual\ninvoices.
