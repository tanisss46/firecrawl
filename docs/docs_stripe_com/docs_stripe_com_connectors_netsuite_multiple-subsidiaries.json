For example, the connector supports the following\nconfigurations:\n\n- One Stripe account with one settlement currency\n- One Stripe account with multiple settlement currencies\n- Multiple Stripe accounts with multiple NetSuite subsidiaries\n- Multiple Stripe accounts with one subsidiary\n\nYou can’t use one Stripe account with multiple NetSuite subsidiaries.\n\n## When to use multiple Stripe accounts\n\nThe connector supports syncing multiple Stripe accounts to one NetSuite\nsubsidiary. Whether or not you use multiple Stripe accounts depends on your\nintegration and other considerations. Review the guidelines below and consult\nwith your implementation partner to understand all accounting and technical\nimplications.\n\n#### Note\n\nHow you structure Stripe accounts and NetSuite subsidiaries can have tax or\nlegal implications. The information below isn’t official legal or tax advice.\nConsult legal counsel for advice about your particular situation.\n\n### Reporting to government authorities\n\nStripe reports all transactions for each account to the relevant government\nauthority. If you have one Stripe account that you use for transactions across\nmultiple subsidiaries, Stripe reports all of the transactions in that account as\nif they came from a single entity. You can’t split transactions from one Stripe\naccount to multiple legal entities.\n\n### Multiple NetSuite subsidiaries\n\nWe recommend associating each Stripe account with a different NetSuite\nsubsidiary. If you use multiple subsidiaries in NetSuite and transact on each\nsubsidiary, you must have a separate Stripe account for each subsidiary.\n\n### Separate configurations\n\nYou can decide how you want to grant access to certain Stripe data by creating\nmultiple Stripe accounts and separating the data as needed. Customer support and\nfinance teams won’t have access to multiple accounts.\n\nThe connector configuration for each account is different. For example, each\naccount might belong to a different department or use a different workflow.\n\nYou must deposit revenue in different bank accounts, depending on the site or\napp where the user made the purchase.\n\n## When not to use multiple Stripe accounts\n\nYou might not need to use multiple Stripe accounts in the following cases:\n\n- Your connector configuration is mostly similar for your accounts. For example,\nthey’re e-commerce accounts and post to the same department, class, or\nsubsidiary.\n- You don’t need to restrict access to certain Stripe data.\n- You want separate API keys for multiple sites or components of an application.\n- You want to share saved payment methods between the sites and applications\nthat use Stripe.\n\n## Configure the connector to use multiple Stripe accounts\n\nThe connector supports using one Stripe account per NetSuite subsidiary, by\ndefault. If necessary, you can configure the connector to use multiple Stripe\naccounts. To do so, you can implement business logic that switches the Stripe\naccount used in your various systems. In addition to your e-commerce application\n(if applicable), you must also update these key connector workflows to specify\nwhich Stripe account to use:\n\n- [Invoice payment\npage](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/netsuite/invoice-payment-page)\n- [Customer payment\npage](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/netsuite/customer-payment-page)\n\n## Test multiple subsidiaries\n\nThe connector supports testing multiple Stripe accounts with multiple NetSuite\nsubsidiaries. Consult with your implementation partner to get started.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Invoice payment\npage](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/netsuite/invoice-payment-page)\n- [Customer payment\npage](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/netsuite/customer-payment-page)",
