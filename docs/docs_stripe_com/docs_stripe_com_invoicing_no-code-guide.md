# No-code Invoicing guide

## Get started with Stripe Invoicing—no code required.

Stripe Invoicing can help you get paid and save time using the Dashboard.
Automatically charge your customer’s payment method on file, or email them the
[invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices) with or without a link to a
payment page. You can also send the invoice or payment page link manually.

#### Note

If you’re interested in managing subscriptions and recurring revenue, see
[Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing).

Before you start using Stripe Invoicing, help your future customers understand
your products and terms of service by [establishing your
business](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/account?support_details) and
[customizing how your brand
appears](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding).

![Brand your

Brand your business

[Choose your payment
methodsOptional](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/no-code-guide#payment-methods)
By default, customers can pay invoices with any of the payment methods that you
enable in your [Invoice
template](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/invoice). If you’re a
first-time user, Stripe automatically enables cards and other payment methods.
You can view these payment methods and turn them on or off in the [Invoice
default payment methods
configuration](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/invoice).

In some situations, there might be restrictions that prevent payment methods
from being used for an invoice. For example, a payment method might only operate
in one currency, or have limitations on the amount that can be paid. Stripe
doesn’t automatically select a payment method when these limitations prevent it
from being used. To learn more, see [Payment
methods](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/payment-methods#supported).

![Choose additional payment
methods](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/supported-payment-methods.949a2d41b8da98f93ad94c95c986e75c.png)

[How to get paid](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/no-code-guide#get-paid)
You can [create and send](https://dashboard.stripe.com/invoices/create) an
invoice from the Dashboard. Invoices provide an itemized list of goods and
services rendered, which includes the cost, quantity, and taxes. You can also
use them as a tool to collect payment. Learn more about [using the
Dashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/dashboard).

[Set up a custom
templateOptional](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/no-code-guide#custom-templates)
You can use the [Invoice
template](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/invoice) to customize
​​the content of your invoices. Set a default memo, footer, numbering scheme,
and determine your default payment terms. Because you know more about your
customers and your business than Stripe does, make sure your invoices include
all of the required information. See the full invoice customization guide at
[Customize invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/customize).

[Track an
invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/no-code-guide#track-invoice)
Invoices move through different statuses from the time they’re created to when
they’re paid. You can track the status of an invoice on the [Invoices
page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/invoices). To let your customer know
that the due date for an invoice is approaching, [send them an email
reminder](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/send-email). For more information on
tracking your invoices, see [Manage
invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/dashboard/manage-invoices).

[Automate collections and
reconciliation](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/no-code-guide#invoicing-plus)
### Automate collections

You can turn on automatic email reminders for unpaid, one-off invoices. You can
schedule reminders to be sent prior to an invoice’s due date, on the due date,
or after. Learn more about [automatic
reminders](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/automatic-collection#automatic-reminders-for-one-off-invoices).

You can choose to [automatically
charge](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/automatic-charging) your customer’s
payment method on file. For one-off invoices that are charged automatically, you
can turn on Smart Retries or scheduled retries to automatically re-attempt the
payment if it fails on the first attempt.

### Close your books and account for revenue

Using [automatic
reconciliation](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/automatic-reconciliation)
means that you don’t need to expose your sensitive bank account details to users
or manually reconcile open invoices with your bank. With auto-reconciliation for
invoices, Stripe can:

- Match incoming payments with invoice amounts.
- Manage overpayment or underpayment, when the amount paid doesn’t match the
invoice.
- Reduce the number of API calls required to transfer funds into Stripe.
- Manage payment retries on open invoices.

![Close your
books](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/invoicing-auto-reconciliation.2d4b2648e4b67e8b2a2c7225a22bec69.png)

Close your books

[Let customers manage their
invoicesOptional](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/no-code-guide#customer-portal)
Share a link to your [customer
portal](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/customer-portal), where
customers can log in with their email to manage invoices, view invoice history,
update payment information, and so on. Learn how to create and share your
[customer portal
link](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management/activate-no-code-customer-portal).
