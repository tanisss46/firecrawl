# Working with Treasury financial accounts

## Use financial accounts to store, send, and receive funds.

After you [gain API access to
Treasury](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/access), Stripe attaches a financial
account to your platform account and enables you to provision financial accounts
for eligible connected accounts on your platform. Each financial account has its
own distinct [balance of
funds](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/account-management/working-with-balances-and-transactions),
separate from the balance of the account it’s linked to. For example, the owner
of a connected account on your platform might have a 100 USD connected account
balance and a 200 USD financial account balance. In this scenario, the connected
account owner has a sum of 300 USD spread between their financial account and
connected account balances. These two balances remain separate, but the API
provides the ability to move money from the connected account balance to the
financial account balance.

In the Stripe API, `FinancialAccount` objects serve as the source and
destination of money movement API requests. You request `Features` through the
API to assign to `FinancialAccounts` that provide additional functionality for
the financial accounts on your platform. For example, to enable payment card
features on a specific financial account, you send an API request with the
`FinancialAccount` ID for the `card_issuing` feature. See [Financial account
features](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/account-management/financial-account-features)
for more information on `Feature` objects. See the [Available
features](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/account-management/financial-account-features#available-features)
section within that guide to check required connected account capabilities for
each `Feature`.

Before you create financial accounts in live mode for your Treasury integration,
we recommend you first create test financial accounts in [test
mode](https://docs.stripe.com/test-mode). Test mode financial accounts can’t
receive or send real money, can’t be used in live mode, and don’t generate a
live account with real routing and account information, but are otherwise
identical in configuration and functionality.

## Create a FinancialAccount

Use `POST /v1/treasury/financial_accounts` to create `FinancialAccounts`.
Include the connected account ID as the value of the `Stripe-Account` header of
the call to associate the `FinancialAccount` with a connected account.

Your platform account and connected accounts can have multiple financial
accounts associated with them. You can create another financial account on your
connected account by providing the connected account ID as the value of the
`Stripe-Account` header. You can associate a maximum of 3 financial accounts to
a single connected account (closed financial accounts don’t contribute to the
limit). The same limit applies to the number of financial accounts attached to
the platform account. If you need a higher account threshold, contact
[treasury-support@stripe.com](mailto:treasury-support@stripe.com).

The following JSON defines the `FinancialAccount` object structure:

```
{
 "object": "treasury.financial_account",
 "created": 1612927106,
 "id": "fa_123",
 "country": "US",
 "supported_currencies": ["usd"],
// Arrays of active, pending and restricted features summarize the status of all
requested features
 "active_features": ["financial_addresses.aba", "deposit_insurance"],
 "pending_features": ["inbound_transfers.ach"],
"restricted_features": ["intra_stripe_flows", "outbound_payments.ach",
"outbound_payments.us_domestic_wire"],
 "balance": {
 "cash": {"usd": 9000},
 "inbound_pending": {"usd": 0},
 "outbound_pending": {"usd": 1000}
 },
// The FinancialAccount gains a FinancialAddress once the
`financial_addresses.aba` feature is active. For more information, see
"Activating features"
 "financial_addresses": [
 {
 "type": "aba",
 "supported_networks": ["ach", "domestic_wire_us"],
 "aba": {
 "account_number_last4": "7890",
// Use the expand[] parameter to view the `account_number` field hidden by
default
 "account_number": "1234567890",
 "routing_number": "000000001",
 "bank_name": "Goldman Sachs"
 }
 }
 ],
 "livemode": true,
 // Financial accounts begin in the "open" state, but can be closed
 // `status_details.closed` is populated once a financial account is closed
 "status": "open",
 "status_details": {
 "closed": {
 // List of one or more reasons why the FinancialAccount was closed:
 // - account_rejected
 // - closed_by_platform
 // - other
 "reasons": [],
 }
 },
 // User-defined metadata
 "metadata": {},
 "nickname": {},
 // Restrictions that the platform can apply to the FinancialAccount
 "platform_restrictions": {
 "inbound_flows": "unrestricted",
 "outbound_flows": "restricted"
 },
}
```

Typically, you also request [financial account
features](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/account-management/financial-account-features)
when you make the API request to create the account. Regardless of the
`Features` you request, the connected account must have the `treasury`
capability enabled. If you’re unsure if the connected account has the
capability, use `GET /v1/accounts/{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}` to check. The
account’s `capabilities` hash must have a `treasury` value of `active`.

```
…
 "capabilities": {
 "card_issuing": "active",
 "card_payments": "active",
 "transfers": "active",
 "treasury": "active",
 "us_bank_account_ach_payments": "active"
 },
…
```

If you want to issue cards attached to the financial account balance, your
platform’s connected accounts must also have the Issuing (`card_issuing`)
capability enabled. The connected account must have this capability before you
can request the `card_issuing` feature for its financial account. If the
connected account doesn’t have the capability, attempting to create a
`FinancialAccount` with a request for the `card_issuing` feature results in an
error.

Set the `nickname` field of a `FinancialAccount` object to designate a custom
name for the financial account. You can use nicknames to create identifiers,
which is useful when working with multiple financial accounts under a single
connected account. Valid nicknames must:

- Be a non-blank string
- Contain less than 250 characters

If you don’t provide a nickname upon account creation, the nickname field will
be empty and will return `null`. You can
[update](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/account-management/financial-accounts#update-a-financialaccount)
nicknames after creating a `FinancialAccount`.

The following request creates a financial account assigned to the connected
account with the ID assigned in the `Stripe-Account` header.

```
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/treasury/financial_accounts \
 -u "sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:" \
 -H "Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}" \
 -d "supported_currencies[]"=usd \
 -d nickname={{OPTIONAL_NICKNAME}} \
 -d "features[card_issuing][requested]"=true \
 -d "features[deposit_insurance][requested]"=true \
 -d "features[financial_addresses][aba][requested]"=true \
 -d "features[inbound_transfers][ach][requested]"=true \
 -d "features[intra_stripe_flows][requested]"=true \
 -d "features[outbound_payments][ach][requested]"=true \
 -d "features[outbound_payments][us_domestic_wire][requested]"=true \
 -d "features[outbound_transfers][ach][requested]"=true \
 -d "features[outbound_transfers][us_domestic_wire][requested]"=true
```

The response is a `FinancialAccount` object to confirm financial account
creation.

```
{
 "object": "treasury.financial_account",
 "created": 1612927106,
 "id": "{{FINANCIAL_ACCOUNT_ID}}",
 "country": "US",
 "supported_currencies": ["usd"],
 "active_features": [
 "card_issuing",
 ],
 // Features that require activation enter a pending state before activating
```

## Update a FinancialAccount

Use `POST /v1/treasury/financial_accounts/{{FINANCIAL_ACCOUNT_ID}}` to update
the `FinancialAccount` with the associated ID. Include the connected account ID
as the `Stripe-Account` header value. The following example updates the
[metadata](https://docs.stripe.com/api/metadata) of the FinancialAccount.

```
curl
https://api.stripe.com/v1/treasury/financial_accounts/{{FINANCIAL_ACCOUNT_ID}} \
 -u "sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:" \
 -H "Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}" \
 -d "metadata[key]"=value
```

## Retrieve a FinancialAccount and account number

Use `GET /v1/treasury/financial_accounts/{{FINANCIALACCOUNT_ID}}` to retrieve
the `FinancialAccount` with the associated ID. Include the connected account ID
as the `Stripe-Account` header value.

```
curl
https://api.stripe.com/v1/treasury/financial_accounts/{{FINANCIAL_ACCOUNT_ID}} \
 -u "sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:" \
 -H "Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}"
```

By default, the account number for a financial account isn’t included in the
response. To retrieve the account number, include the
`financial_addresses.aba.account_number` field in the `expand` array.

```
curl -G
https://api.stripe.com/v1/treasury/financial_accounts/{{FINANCIAL_ACCOUNT_ID}} \
 -u "sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:" \
 -H "Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}" \
 -d "expand[]"="financial_addresses.aba.account_number"
```

If successful, the response returns the `FinancialAccount` object with or
without the account number depending on the inclusion of the `expand` array.

```
{
 "id": {{FINANCIAL_ACCOUNT_ID}},
 ...
 "financial_addresses": [
 {
 "aba": {
 "account_holder_name": "jenny",
 "account_number": "4242424242420239",
 "account_number_last4": "0239",
 "bank_name": "Stripe Test Bank",
 "routing_number": "000000001"
 },
 ...
 }
 ],
 ...
}
```

For more information on the `expand` parameter, see [expanding
responses](https://docs.stripe.com/expand).

### Feature summary

The `FinancialAccount` object contains a summary of the state of all its
`Features` in three arrays - `active_features`, `pending_features`, and
`restricted_features`.

```
{
 "object": "treasury.financial_account",
 "id": "fa_987",
 "status": "open",
 ...
 "active_features": ["card_issuing"],
 "pending_features": ["financial_addresses.aba"],
 "restricted_features": ["outbound_transfers.ach"],
}
```

These arrays provide a convenient way to see:

- Inactive features (included in `pending_features` or `restricted_features`)
- Active features (included in `active_features`)
- Restricted features that require action (included in `restricted_features`)

See [Financial account
features](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/account-management/financial-account-features)
for more information.

## Close a FinancialAccount

You can permanently close a financial account if it meets the following
conditions:

- There are no pending inbound transfers.
- All attached Issuing cards are canceled.
- The account balance is zero and the account has no activity in the past 75
days. Alternatively, you can provide another financial account or external
account to
[forward](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/account-management/financial-accounts#handling-transactions-on-closed-accounts)
incoming debits and credits to.

#### Warning

You can’t reopen financial accounts after you’ve closed them.

Closing a financial account has no impact on data retention for associated
objects, such as `Transactions`.

## FinancialAccount closure using the API

You can use `POST/v1/treasury/financial_accounts/{{FINANCIAL_ACCOUNT_ID}}/close`
to close the financial account with the associated ID. Include the associated
connected account ID as a header value.

```
curl
https://api.stripe.com/v1/treasury/financial_accounts/{{FINANCIAL_ACCOUNT_ID}}/close
\
 -u sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2: \
 -X "POST" \
 -H "Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTED_STRIPE_ACCOUNT_ID}}"
```

The response is the `FinancialAccount` object with a `status` of `closed` to
confirm the action.

```
{
 "id": "{{FINANCIAL_ACCOUNT_ID}}",
 "object": "treasury.financial_account",
 "status": "closed",
 "status_details": {
 "closed": {
 "reasons": ["closed_by_platform"]
 }
 },
 "active_features": [],
 "pending_features": [],
 "restricted_features": ["financial_addresses.aba"],
 ...
}
```

### Handling transactions on closed accounts

In rare circumstances, financial accounts might receive credits or debits on
closed accounts that Stripe can’t return automatically. As a platform owner,
you’re responsible for negative balances incurred after account closure. Stripe
support works with you to return any remaining funds owed to the seller or
service provider and to remediate closed accounts with a negative balance. By
including forwarding settings when closing a financial account, Stripe can
automatically forward debits and credits to the selected account.

## Webhooks

You can create financial accounts before fulfilling onboarding requirements. In
this case, the financial account opens asynchronously and then triggers a
`treasury.financial_account.features_status_updated`
[webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) with an updated view on any features
still restricted due to outstanding onboarding requirements.

- `account.updated`- When requesting new Features, the platform might get an
`account.updated` webhook prompting that the requirements hash has changed and
some new fields are now in `pending_verification`.
- `treasury.financial_account.created`- Triggered whenever a new
FinancialAccount is created.
- `treasury.financial_account.closed`- Notifies when the status of the top-level
FinancialAccount changes to closed.
- `treasury.financial_account.features_status_updated`- Indicates that one or
more Features have changed status. This is reflected in changes to the
`active_features, pending_features` or `restricted_features` arrays.
