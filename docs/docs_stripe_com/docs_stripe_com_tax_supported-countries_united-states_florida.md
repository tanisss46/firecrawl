# Collect tax in Florida

## Learn how to use Stripe Tax to calculate, collect, and report tax in Florida.

In Florida, Stripe Tax supports calculation and collection of [sales
tax](https://floridarevenue.com/taxes/taxesfees/Pages/sales_tax.aspx).

## When to register for tax collection

See [Thresholds](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/thresholds) to get insights
about your potential tax registration obligations in Florida. Stripe also
notifies you with email and Dashboard alerts when you need to register to
collect tax. Learn more about how the [monitoring tool
works](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/monitoring).

### Sales tax

Remote sellers must register to collect and remit tax in Florida when, in the
previous calendar year, they exceed a sales threshold of 100,000 USD.

The threshold includes taxable sales. The threshold excludes nontaxable sales,
wholesale sales (sales of resale), and marketplace sales.

### Other taxes

We also support:

- [Florida Communications Services
tax](https://floridarevenue.com/taxes/taxesfees/Pages/cst.aspx)—for businesses
selling video or audio streaming to customers in Florida. This includes the
Communications Services Tax, Communications Services Gross Receipts Tax and
Local Communications Services Tax. These taxes only apply when your business has
physical presence in Florida. This means there isn’t a revenue threshold for
when remote sellers need to pay this tax. Transactions for these taxes aren’t
included in Stripe monitoring for Florida.

## Register to collect tax

Register for tax in Florida at the [tax
authority](https://floridarevenue.com/taxes/taxesfees/Pages/sales_tax.aspx).
Read more about registering for [sales tax in the US in our
guide](https://stripe.com/guides/sales-tax-registration-process-us). You can
also use [Stripe to
register](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/use-stripe-to-register) on your behalf.

After you’ve registered to collect tax in Florida, go to
[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations?location=us-fl)
to add your registrations to Stripe in the Dashboard. This turns on tax
calculation and collection in Stripe for your transactions in Florida.

Learn [how to add your
registration](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/registering#track-your-registrations-in-the-tax-dashboard)
in the Dashboard.

## How we calculate taxes

Stripe calculates the taxes that apply to your customer’s location.

## Report and file your taxes

Stripe provides reports of your completed tax transactions. Go to
[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations) to access these
reports.

### Exports

The tax transaction data export provides a comprehensive and aggregated view of
transactions by location, including a breakdown of individual tax amounts. Learn
more about [tax reporting exports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports#exports).

### Location reports

[Location reports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports#us-location-reports)
offer a summary of transaction and refund data for specific US locations and
align with Florida filing requirements. You have the option to report on an
annual, semiannual, quarterly, or monthly basis.

Reporting-specific considerations:

- Certain areas in Florida can impose an extra sales surtax, but there is a set
limit on how much tax will be applied based on the transaction amount. You won’t
see a location report for Florida if you had these transactions. Use the
[exports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports#exports) instead for a detailed
tax breakdown of each transaction.
- The location reports don’t include transactions with the Florida
Communications Services tax as these are filed to the state using a different
report. To see transactions with these taxes, you can use the
[exports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports#exports).

### Filing

Stripe Tax has filing partners—Taxually, Marosa, and Hands-off Sales Tax
(HOST)—to help automate your tax filing. These partners automatically sync your
tax transaction data in real time, eliminating the need for manual data entry or
file transfers. Learn more about [tax
filing](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/filing).
