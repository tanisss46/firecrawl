  "content": "# Transfer Payout Split: Stripe-Version 2017-04-06\n\nOn April 6, 2017, Stripe split the `/v1/transfers` resource into `/v1/transfers`\nand `/v1/payouts`. This is a versioned change–your existing integrations don’t\nneed to change.\n\nSince Stripe was launched, we’ve used the word **transfer** to mean moving money\nout of Stripe and into your bank account or debit card. But when\n[Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect) was launched years later, we co-opted\nthat term to also mean moving money between a platform and its connected\naccounts.\n\nThis ultimately turned out to be confusing. These are conceptually different\nflows of funds as they apply to a business. This made it difficult to document\ntransfers, and also bloated the `/v1/transfers` API because the fields needed to\nsupport each flow of funds were different.\n\nAs of Stripe-Version `2017-04-06`:\n\n- **Payouts** will mean moving money from Stripe to your bank account or debit\ncard and will be represented by `/v1/payouts`.\n- **Transfers** will mean moving money between Stripe accounts as part of\nConnect and will be represented by `/v1/transfers`.\n- Relative to the legacy `/v1/transfers` resource, the new `/v1/transfers`\nresource won’t have these fields:- `method` - this only applies to\n[payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts).\n- `status` - this only applies to payouts.\n- `type` - this only applies to payouts.\n- `bank_account` - this only applies to payouts.\n- `card` - this only applies to payouts.\n- `failure_message` - this only applies to payouts.\n- `failure_code` - this only applies to payouts.\n- `description` - description was confusing because it applied to the transfer\nbut not the resultant payment on the connected account. Use `metadata` to attach\nadditional information to a transfer.\n- `application_fee` - application_fee is no longer necessary. See [Connect\ndestination charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges).\n- Relative to the legacy `/v1/transfers`, the new `/v1/payouts` resource won’t\nhave these fields:- `reversals` - payouts can now be simply canceled.\n- `reversed` - refer to the payout status.\n- `application_fee` - this only applies to legacy transfers.\n- `destination_payment` - this only applies to transfers.\n- `source_transaction` - this only applies to legacy transfers.\n- `description` - description was removed because it didn’t provide enough\nvalue. Use metadata to attach additional information to a payout.\n- On the `/v1/payouts` resource, the `date` field was renamed to `arrival_date`.\n- To send a payout to your default bank account or debit card, instead of\nincluding the parameter `destination=default_for_currency`, simply omit the\n`destination` entirely.\n- Canceling a payout is now done via `POST /v1/payouts/:id/cancel`. The balance\ntransaction resulting from a cancellation is available via the\n`cancellation_balance_transaction` field on the payout. The `status` of a\ncanceled payout is `canceled`.\n- When creating a transfer, you can now only use a charge as the\n`source_transaction`. Previously, it was possible to use any transaction (such\nas an application fee, or an adjustment) as a `source_transaction`. This did not\nmesh well with the intended use case of tagging outgoing transfers with the\nincoming source of funds, so this is no longer supported on the new API version.\n- Payouts now generate these events: `payout.created`, `payout.failed`,\n`payout.reversed`, `payout.paid`, `payout.updated`, which are the equivalent of\nthe legacy `transfer.*` events.\n- Transfers no longer generate these events: `transfer.paid` and\n`transfer.failed`.\n- Balance transactions can have these types as they relate to payouts: `type` ∈\n{`payout`, `payout_failure`, `payout_cancel`}\n- Balance transactions can have these types as they relate to transfers: `type`\n∈ {`transfer`, `transfer_refund`}\n- Fields on the [Account API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts) were\nrenamed:- `transfers_enabled` → `payouts_enabled`\n- `transfer_schedule` → `payout_schedule`\n- `transfer_statement_descriptor` → `payout_statement_descriptor`\n- Transfers to the deprecated Recipients API are no longer represented on this\nversion of the API. Use a legacy API version to access any transfers to\nrecipients that you may have.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)\n- [payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts)\n- [Connect destination\ncharges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges)\n- [Account API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts)",
