However, customers can dispute PayPal payments if for\nexample:\n\n- They don’t receive the goods they paid for\n- The received goods don’t match their description\n\nNote that your settlement choice when activating PayPal affects the funds flow\nfor PayPal disputes. See [Choose settlement\npreference](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/paypal/choose-settlement-preference#refunds-and-disputes)\nfor more context.\n\n## Dispute process\n\nCustomers can file a dispute on PayPal up to 180 calendar days from the date of\npurchase. They can also file a dispute through the payment instrument they used\nto complete the PayPal purchase (such as their bank).\n\nAfter the customer initiates a dispute, Stripe notifies you through:\n\n- Email\n- The [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/disputes)\n- An API `charge.dispute.created` event (if your integration is set up to\nreceive [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks))\n- Push notification (if you’ve subscribed)\n\nDepending on the type of dispute and where it was filed, PayPal might offer the\nability for you to communicate directly with the customer in an attempt to\nresolve the dispute before countering it. Currently, Stripe doesn’t offer this\nfunctionality and requests that you turn to PayPal to contact the customer.\n\nIf no agreement is reached, you can either accept or counter the dispute. If you\nchoose to counter, Stripe requests that you [submit\nevidence](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/responding#respond) that you\nfulfilled the purchase order in the [Stripe\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/responding#respond). This evidence\nhelps PayPal determine if a dispute is valid or if they should reject it. The\nevidence you provide must contain as much detail as possible from what the\ncustomer provided at checkout. You must submit the requested information within\n2 to 19 calendar days, depending on the category of the dispute. PayPal aims to\nmake a decision within 30 calendar days of evidence submission.\n\nIf you prefer to handle disputes programmatically, you can [respond to disputes\nusing the API](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/api).\n\n## Dispute resolution\n\nIf PayPal resolves the dispute with you winning, the disputed amount will be\nreturned to your balance.\n\nIf PayPal rules in favor of the customer, the dispute is lost and the balance\ncharge becomes permanent.\n\nIn some cases, PayPal will allow a lost dispute to be appealed. Currently,\nStripe does not support appeals and requests that you turn to PayPal to file an\nappeal. In these cases, the dispute will remain open on Stripe until a final\nresolution has been reached by PayPal. Please refer to PayPal to be notified on\nwhen a dispute becomes appealable.\n\nRead more about disputes on [how disputes\nwork](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/how-disputes-work) and [best practices\nfor responding to disputes](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/best-practices).\n\n## Fees\n\nPayPal might charge fees for disputes. The terms and amount of PayPal dispute\nfees are set by PayPal. Stripe does not charge any additional fees for PayPal\ndisputes.\n\n## Multiple disputes per payment\n\nA buyer can reopen a dispute on PayPal if there are subsequent issues with an\norder. For example, the buyer might create a dispute because they haven’t\nreceived their goods (`product_not_received`). After you counter and win the\ncase, the buyer can change the category of the dispute on PayPal by claiming\nthat the product they received isn’t what they ordered (`product_unacceptable`).\nThis action causes the dispute to reopen on PayPal.\n\nOn Stripe, each claim in a specific category is represented by a separate\ndispute. In contrast, on PayPal, the original dispute is reopened under a\ndifferent category. This means you might have multiple disputes for a single\npayment. In the example above, there are two disputes on Stripe: the first one\nfor `product_not_received` and the second one for `product_unacceptable`. Both\nof these disputes link to the same dispute on PayPal.\n\nIn rare cases, you might see two disputes with the same category for the same\npayment on Stripe. This happens when the buyer first files a dispute on PayPal,\nloses it, then files the same dispute with their bank.\n\n## Testing your integration\n\nStripe allows you to simulate a [disputed\ntransaction](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes) by specifying `email` values that\nmatch the patterns described in [test\nscenarios](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/paypal/disputed-payments#scenarios)\nwhen you create a PaymentIntent (as part of the [billing\ndetails](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-payment_method_data-billing_details)).\nYou can choose from the different test scenarios to simulate disputes of all\nrelevant categories.\n\nFor example, creating the PaymentIntent server-side and simulating a disputed\ntransaction where the buyer claims they didn’t receive the product looks like:\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d amount=1099 \\\n -d currency=eur \\\n -d \"payment_method_types[]\"=paypal \\\n -d \"payment_method_data[type]\"=paypal \\\n--data-urlencode\n\"payment_method_data[billing_details][email]\"=\"dispute_not_received@example.com\"\n```\n\nIf using [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout) or [Payment\nLinks](https://docs.stripe.com/no-code/payment-links), you can enter the email\nin the checkout form. Shortly after the payment has been completed, it will be\ndisputed as `product_not_received`.\n\n### Test scenarios\n\nThe table below displays the scenarios available to test. Each scenario produces\na dispute shortly after a payment has been completed.\n\n`.*` represents any valid character in an email. For example, the pattern\n`.*dispute_duplicate@.*` is matched by an email such as\n`my_dispute_duplicate@mycompany.com`.\n\nEmail patternScenario`.*dispute_credit_not_processed@.*`Tests a dispute for a\npayment where the customer claims they’re entitled to a full or partial refund\nbecause they returned the purchased product or didn’t fully use it, or the\ntransaction was otherwise canceled or not fully fulfilled, but you haven’t yet\nprovided a refund or credit.`.*dispute_duplicate@.*`The customer claims they\nwere charged multiple times for the same product or\nservice.`.*dispute_fraudulent@.*`The customer claims that the transaction is\nfraudulent and they did not authorize the\ntransaction.`.*dispute_general@.*`Tests a dispute for a payment where an\nuncategorized dispute has been opened.`.*dispute_not_received@.*`The customer\nclaims that they have not received the product or service they\npurchased.`.*dispute_product_unacceptable@.*`The customer claims that the\nproduct or service they purchased was unacceptable or otherwise not as\ndescribed.`.*dispute_subscription_cancelled@.*`The customer claims that they\nwere charged for a subscription after it was canceled.\n### Evidence\n\nTo simulate winning or losing the dispute, respond with one of the evidence\nvalues from the table below.\n\n- If you [respond using the API](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/api), pass the\nvalue from the table as\n[uncategorized_text](https://docs.stripe.com/api/disputes/update#update_dispute-evidence-uncategorized_text).\n- If you [respond in the\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/responding), enter the value from\nthe table in the **Additional information** field. Then, click **Submit\nevidence**.\nEvidenceDescription`winning_evidence`The dispute is closed and marked as won.\nYour account is credited the amount of the charge.`losing_evidence`The dispute\nis closed and marked as lost. Your account isn’t credited.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Choose settlement\npreference](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/paypal/choose-settlement-preference#refunds-and-disputes)\n- [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/disputes)\n- [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks)\n- [submit evidence](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/responding#respond)\n- [respond to disputes using the API](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/api)\n- [how disputes work](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/how-disputes-work)\n- [best practices for responding to\ndisputes](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/best-practices)\n- [disputed transaction](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes)\n- [billing\ndetails](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-payment_method_data-billing_details)\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout)\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/no-code/payment-links)\n-\n[uncategorized_text](https://docs.stripe.com/api/disputes/update#update_dispute-evidence-uncategorized_text)\n- [respond in the Dashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/responding)",
