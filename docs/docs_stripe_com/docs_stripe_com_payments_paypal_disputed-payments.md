# Disputed PayPal payments

## Learn how dispute management works for PayPal, a digital wallet popular with businesses in Europe.

The risk of fraud or unrecognized PayPal payments is low because the customer
must authenticate the payment with their PayPal account.

## Overview

Customers must authenticate any payment with their PayPal account to decrease
the risk of fraud. However, customers can dispute PayPal payments if for
example:

- They don’t receive the goods they paid for
- The received goods don’t match their description

Note that your settlement choice when activating PayPal affects the funds flow
for PayPal disputes. See [Choose settlement
preference](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/paypal/choose-settlement-preference#refunds-and-disputes)
for more context.

## Dispute process

Customers can file a dispute on PayPal up to 180 calendar days from the date of
purchase. They can also file a dispute through the payment instrument they used
to complete the PayPal purchase (such as their bank).

After the customer initiates a dispute, Stripe notifies you through:

- Email
- The [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/disputes)
- An API `charge.dispute.created` event (if your integration is set up to
receive [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks))
- Push notification (if you’ve subscribed)

Depending on the type of dispute and where it was filed, PayPal might offer the
ability for you to communicate directly with the customer in an attempt to
resolve the dispute before countering it. Currently, Stripe doesn’t offer this
functionality and requests that you turn to PayPal to contact the customer.

If no agreement is reached, you can either accept or counter the dispute. If you
choose to counter, Stripe requests that you [submit
evidence](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/responding#respond) that you
fulfilled the purchase order in the [Stripe
Dashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/responding#respond). This evidence
helps PayPal determine if a dispute is valid or if they should reject it. The
evidence you provide must contain as much detail as possible from what the
customer provided at checkout. You must submit the requested information within
2 to 19 calendar days, depending on the category of the dispute. PayPal aims to
make a decision within 30 calendar days of evidence submission.

If you prefer to handle disputes programmatically, you can [respond to disputes
using the API](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/api).

## Dispute resolution

If PayPal resolves the dispute with you winning, the disputed amount will be
returned to your balance.

If PayPal rules in favor of the customer, the dispute is lost and the balance
charge becomes permanent.

In some cases, PayPal will allow a lost dispute to be appealed. Currently,
Stripe does not support appeals and requests that you turn to PayPal to file an
appeal. In these cases, the dispute will remain open on Stripe until a final
resolution has been reached by PayPal. Please refer to PayPal to be notified on
when a dispute becomes appealable.

## Fees

PayPal might charge fees for disputes. The terms and amount of PayPal dispute
fees are set by PayPal. Stripe does not charge any additional fees for PayPal
disputes.

## Multiple disputes per payment

A buyer can reopen a dispute on PayPal if there are subsequent issues with an
order. For example, the buyer might create a dispute because they haven’t
received their goods (`product_not_received`). After you counter and win the
case, the buyer can change the category of the dispute on PayPal by claiming
that the product they received isn’t what they ordered (`product_unacceptable`).
This action causes the dispute to reopen on PayPal.

On Stripe, each claim in a specific category is represented by a separate
dispute. In contrast, on PayPal, the original dispute is reopened under a
different category. This means you might have multiple disputes for a single
payment. In the example above, there are two disputes on Stripe: the first one
for `product_not_received` and the second one for `product_unacceptable`. Both
of these disputes link to the same dispute on PayPal.

In rare cases, you might see two disputes with the same category for the same
payment on Stripe. This happens when the buyer first files a dispute on PayPal,
loses it, then files the same dispute with their bank.

## Testing your integration

Stripe allows you to simulate a [disputed
transaction](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes) by specifying `email` values that
match the patterns described in [test
scenarios](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/paypal/disputed-payments#scenarios)
when you create a PaymentIntent (as part of the [billing
details](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-payment_method_data-billing_details)).
You can choose from the different test scenarios to simulate disputes of all
relevant categories.

For example, creating the PaymentIntent server-side and simulating a disputed
transaction where the buyer claims they didn’t receive the product looks like:

```
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents \
 -u "sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:" \
 -d amount=1099 \
 -d currency=eur \
 -d "payment_method_types[]"=paypal \
 -d "payment_method_data[type]"=paypal \
--data-urlencode
"payment_method_data[billing_details][email]"="dispute_not_received@example.com"
```

If using [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout) or [Payment
Links](https://docs.stripe.com/no-code/payment-links), you can enter the email
in the checkout form. Shortly after the payment has been completed, it will be
disputed as `product_not_received`.

### Test scenarios

The table below displays the scenarios available to test. Each scenario produces
a dispute shortly after a payment has been completed.

`.*` represents any valid character in an email. For example, the pattern
`.*dispute_duplicate@.*` is matched by an email such as
`my_dispute_duplicate@mycompany.com`.

Email patternScenario`.*dispute_credit_not_processed@.*`Tests a dispute for a
payment where the customer claims they’re entitled to a full or partial refund
because they returned the purchased product or didn’t fully use it, or the
transaction was otherwise canceled or not fully fulfilled, but you haven’t yet
provided a refund or credit.`.*dispute_duplicate@.*`The customer claims they
were charged multiple times for the same product or
service.`.*dispute_fraudulent@.*`The customer claims that the transaction is
fraudulent and they did not authorize the
transaction.`.*dispute_general@.*`Tests a dispute for a payment where an
uncategorized dispute has been opened.`.*dispute_not_received@.*`The customer
claims that they have not received the product or service they
purchased.`.*dispute_product_unacceptable@.*`The customer claims that the
product or service they purchased was unacceptable or otherwise not as
described.`.*dispute_subscription_cancelled@.*`The customer claims that they
were charged for a subscription after it was canceled.
### Evidence

To simulate winning or losing the dispute, respond with one of the evidence
values from the table below.

- If you [respond using the API](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/api), pass the
value from the table as
[uncategorized_text](https://docs.stripe.com/api/disputes/update#update_dispute-evidence-uncategorized_text).
- If you [respond in the
Dashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/responding), enter the value from
the table in the **Additional information** field. Then, click **Submit
evidence**.
EvidenceDescription`winning_evidence`The dispute is closed and marked as won.
