These\ntaxes apply on the sale of physical goods, digital goods, and services.\n\nStripe calculates tax on a transaction taking into account some or all of the\nfollowing factors:\n\n- The location of the seller\n- The location of the customer\n- The type of the product sold\n- Whether the transaction involves a [reverse\ncharge](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/zero-tax#reverse-charges)\n- The status of the customer (for example, whether they’re a VAT-registered\nbusiness, private person or an exempt organization)\n\n## How Stripe uses addresses\n\nStripe uses a single address as the customer’s location, or transaction\ndestination, when calculating taxes. For more information, see [which customer\naddress we\nuse](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/customer-locations#address-hierarchy).\n\nIn certain scenarios, it’s important to identify the origin of a transaction.\nStripe generally uses the address where your business is located as the origin\nof a transaction. This address is defined as your origin address in the\nDashboard or as `head_office` if using the tax settings object.\n\n### How to use ship-from addresses\n\nYou can add ship-from addresses that differ from your business address for tax\ncalculation. To add them, use the `ship_from_address` transaction object. You\ncan add ship-from locations only using the [Stripe Tax\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/custom). They aren’t available in integrations\nof Stripe Tax with Payment Links, Checkout, or Billing and Invoicing. If you\nenter an unrecognized ship-from address, Stripe returns a\n`shipping_address_invalid` error.\n\nStripe Tax can designate only one address as the origin of a transaction even\nthough in some countries the determination of origin can vary by product type.\nIf you provide the ship-from address, Stripe Tax uses it to calculate tax for\nboth services and physical goods. If you don’t provide a ship-from address,\nStripe Tax assumes that the origin of the transaction is the address where your\nbusiness is located. When selling a combination of products that require\ndifferent origin locations, consider splitting the transaction accordingly.\n\n[Specify product tax codes and tax behaviorLearn how to set up products and\nprices to automatically calculate\ntax.](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/products-prices-tax-codes-tax-behavior)[Collect\ncustomer addressesLearn how to collect customer addresses to automatically\ncalculate tax.](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/customer-locations)[Zero tax amounts\nand reverse chargesLearn about cases when Stripe calculates zero\ntax.](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/zero-tax)[Customize tax behaviorSet up Tax to\nfit your business needs with tax\ncustomizations.](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-customizations)[Countries\nsupported by Stripe TaxLearn how to use Stripe to calculate, collect, and report\ntax in different countries](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries)\n\n## Links\n\n- [VAT](https://stripe.com/guides/introduction-to-eu-vat-and-european-vat-oss)\n- [GST](https://stripe.com/guides/tax-registration-process-canada)\n- [reverse charge](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/zero-tax#reverse-charges)\n- [which customer address we\nuse](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/customer-locations#address-hierarchy)\n- [Stripe Tax API](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/custom)\n- [Specify product tax codes and tax behaviorLearn how to set up products and\nprices to automatically calculate\ntax.](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/products-prices-tax-codes-tax-behavior)\n- [Collect customer addressesLearn how to collect customer addresses to\nautomatically calculate tax.](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/customer-locations)\n- [Zero tax amounts and reverse chargesLearn about cases when Stripe calculates\nzero tax.](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/zero-tax)\n- [Customize tax behaviorSet up Tax to fit your business needs with tax\ncustomizations.](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-customizations)\n- [Countries supported by Stripe TaxLearn how to use Stripe to calculate,\ncollect, and report tax in different\ncountries](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries)",
