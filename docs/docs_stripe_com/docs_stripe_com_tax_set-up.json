  "content": "# Set up Stripe Tax\n\n## Enable Stripe Tax to automatically calculate and collect tax.\n\nTo set up Stripe Tax, configure your tax settings through the Dashboard on the\n[tax settings page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/tax). Alternatively,\nyou can use the [Tax Settings API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax/settings).\nDepending on your integration, add [one line of\ncode](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/set-up#integrate) to enable tax.\n\nIf you’re a platform that wants to set up Stripe Tax for your connected accounts\nthat are responsible for collecting, filing, and reporting taxes, see [Tax for\nsoftware platforms](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-for-platforms).\n\n#### Note\n\n[Log in](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/tax) or [sign\nup](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register) for Stripe to enable Stripe Tax.\n\n## Get started with a video demo\n\nThis short video shows you how to enable automatic tax collection through the\nDashboard.\n\n[Set your origin address](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/set-up#origin-address)\nOrigin address is where your business is located or, if you sell physical goods,\nthe address where you’re shipping goods from.\n\nBy default, we set your origin address to your Stripe business address so you\nonly need to review and confirm that your details are correct on the [tax\nsettings page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/tax). Alternatively, you\ncan [retrieve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax/settings/retrieve) and\n[update](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax/settings/update) your origin address\nusing the API.\n\n[Select your preset tax\ncode](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/set-up#preset-tax-code)\nA tax code is a classification of your product or service for Stripe Tax. We use\nthis to make sure that the correct tax rate is applied to your transactions.\n\n- **Preset product tax code:** The preset product tax code is the default tax\ncode that applies to your\n[Products](https://docs.stripe.com/api/products/object) when you don’t\nexplicitly specify a\n[tax_code](https://docs.stripe.com/api/products/object#product_object-tax_code).\nTo learn more about the relationship between products, prices, and tax codes,\nand how they impact tax behavior, see the [products, prices, and tax\ncodes](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/products-prices-tax-codes-tax-behavior)\ndocumentation.\n\nYou must select the most appropriate product tax code for every product or\nservice you sell. Visit the [tax settings\npage](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/tax) to select a preset product tax\ncode to serve as the default. Afterwards, visit the [product\ncatalogue](https://dashboard.stripe.com/products?active=true&has_tax_code=false)\nto confirm that the default is correct for your existing products. If not, edit\neach product to select a more appropriate product tax code for it.\n\n- **Default shipping tax code:** The tax treatment type applied to shipping or\ndelivery fees added to your charge. Some countries levy a distinct tax rate\nspecifically on shipping fees. The default shipping tax code is used to identify\nthis unique tax treatment.\n\nIf you’re selling digital goods or services, or if your business is based in the\nEU, you typically don’t need to select a tax treatment. However, if neither of\nthese conditions apply to your business, select the tax treatment that’s most\nrelevant to you. In the absence of a specific shipping tax code on a shipping\nrate, we default to using the tax treatment you’ve selected.\n\n[Select whether prices include tax by\ndefault](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/set-up#default-tax-behavior)\nTax behavior is a setting that determines whether Stripe should add taxes on top\nof your price, or if the price already includes taxes. This ensures that taxes\ndon’t affect the total amount charged to your customers.\n\nTo calculate the total amount, Stripe needs to know the tax behavior of each\nprice in the transaction. The default tax behavior is the default setting that\napplies when you don’t explicitly specify the\n[tax_behavior](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/object#price_object-tax_behavior)\non a [Price object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices).\n\nYou have three options:\n\n- **Exclusive:** You want to exclude tax from prices so that you add tax on top.\n- **Inclusive:** You want to include tax in prices so that tax doesn’t affect\nthe total.\n- **Automatic:** You want to use the\n[currency](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/object#price_object-currency) of\nprices to let Stripe decide whether to include or exclude tax. Stripe excludes\ntax from prices in USD and CAD, but includes it in prices for all other\ncurrencies.\n\nLearn about [tax behavior for products and\nprices](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/products-prices-tax-codes-tax-behavior#tax-behavior).\n\n[Add registrations](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/set-up#add-registrations)\nBefore you start collecting tax from your customers, you must\n[register](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/registering) with the local tax\nauthority. A [tax registration](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax/registrations)\nlets Stripe know that your business is registered to collect tax on payments\nwithin a region, enabling you to automatically collect tax. Our [monitoring tool\nin the Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/transactions) helps you\nunderstand where you might need to register with the local tax authority.\n\nVisit [Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations) in the\nDashboard to add your tax registrations. If you haven’t registered yet but are\nplanning to, you can also schedule a tax registration to take effect at a date\nin the future. You can also use [Stripe to\nregister](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/use-stripe-to-register) on your behalf.\n\n[Enable Tax in your Stripe integration or use the Stripe Tax\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/set-up#integrate)\nThe final step in setting up Stripe Tax is to enable automatic tax on your\nStripe integration. Here’s how:\n\nNo-codeLow-code\nAfter you click **Get started**, Stripe Tax is automatically enabled for new\ntransactions that you create in the Dashboard.
