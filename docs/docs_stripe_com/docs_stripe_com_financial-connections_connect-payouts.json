The platform can’t access additional bank account data on those\naccounts.\n\n## Links\n\n- [overview of integration\noptions](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/use-cases)\n- [Financial Connections\naccount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/accounts/object)\n- [balances](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/balances)\n- [transactions](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/transactions)\n- [ownership](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/ownership)\n- [Connect\nOnboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/payouts-bank-accounts?bank-account-collection-method=financial-connections)\n- [own onboarding\nflow](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/payouts-bank-accounts?bank-account-collection-method=financial-connections&bank-account-collection-integration=direct-api)",
