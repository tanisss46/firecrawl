# Collect a bank account to enhance Connect payouts

## Collect your connected account's bank account and use account data to enhance payouts.

Financial Connections lets you instantly collect tokenized account and routing
numbers for payouts to connected accounts where your platform is liable for
negative balances, including Custom and Express accounts.

Financial Connections helps you:

- Increase onboarding conversion by eliminating the need for your connected
accounts to leave your website or application to locate their account and
routing numbers.
- Reduce payout failure rates by eliminating errors that result from manual
entry of account and routing numbers.
- Stay secure by not storing sensitive data such as account and routing numbers
on your server.
- Save development time by eliminating your need to build bank account manual
entry forms.
- Enable your users to connect their accounts in fewer steps with Link, allowing
them to save and quickly reuse their bank account details across Stripe
merchants.

Optionally, Stripe platforms in the US can request permission from your accounts
to retrieve additional data on their [Financial Connections
account](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/accounts/object).
Consider optimizing your onboarding process by accessing
[balances](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/balances),
[transactions](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/transactions), and
[ownership](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/ownership)
information.

Retrieving additional account data can help you:

- Mitigate fraud when onboarding accounts by verifying the ownership details of
their bank account, such as the name and address of the account holder.
- Underwrite accounts for financial services that you might offer on your
platform with balances and transactions data.

## Get started

For accounts where your platform is liable for negative balances, such as Custom
and Express accounts, enable Stripe Financial Connections either within the
[Connect
Onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/payouts-bank-accounts?bank-account-collection-method=financial-connections)
web form or within your [own onboarding
flow](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/payouts-bank-accounts?bank-account-collection-method=financial-connections&bank-account-collection-integration=direct-api).

For accounts where your platform isn’t liable for negative balances, including
Standard connected accounts, account onboarding always uses Financial
Connections. The platform can’t access additional bank account data on those
accounts.
