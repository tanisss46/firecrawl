If you have a large number of products and prices or\nif you’re [building a custom\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/build-subscriptions?ui=elements)\nwith Elements, you need to use the API.\n\n- Use the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products) to create and\nmanage products and prices if you want to avoid writing code or if you only have\na few products and prices. Set up your [pricing\nmodel](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models) in test mode and\nclick the ** to live mode** button on the product details page.\n- Use the [API](https://docs.stripe.com/api) or the [Stripe\nCLI](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli) to create and manage products and\nprices. The API is a direct method that you use for production implementations.\nThe Stripe CLI is a developer tool that helps you build, test, and manage your\nintegration with Stripe directly from your terminal.\n\nThe following API steps use a fictional SaaS collaboration tool (Togethere) as\nan example, where the basic product is a project management dashboard.\n\n## Create a product\n\nDashboardAPI\n### Create a product and price\n\n#### Create a product\n\nTo create a product in the Dashboard:\n\n- Go to **More** > **Product catalog**.\n- Click **+Add product**.\n- Enter the **Name** of your product.\n- *(Optional)* Add a **Description**. The description appears at checkout, on\nthe [customer portal](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management), and in\n[quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/quotes).\n- *(Optional)* Add an **Image** of your product. Use a JPEG, PNG, or WEBP file\nthat’s smaller than 2MB. The image appears at checkout.\n- *(Optional)* If you’re using [Stripe Tax](https://docs.stripe.com/tax), select\na **Tax code** for your product. See [tax\ncodes](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes) for more information about the\nappropriate category for your product.\n- *(Optional)* Enter a **Statement descriptor**. This descriptor overrides any\naccount descriptors for recurring payments. Choose something that your customers\nwould recognize on a bank statement.\n- *(Optional)* Enter a **Unit label**. This describes how you sell your product.\nFor example, if you charge by the seat, enter “seat” so the line item includes\n“per seat” for the price. Unit labels appear at checkout, and in invoices,\nreceipts, and the [customer\nportal](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/customer-portal).\n\n#### Create a price for the product\n\nTo save a product in the Dashboard, you must also add at least one price.\n\nThe product editor shows the flat-rate pricing model by default. You can create\nmultiple prices or use a different pricing model with the **Advanced pricing\noptions**.\n\n- Select a **Pricing model**. For more details about recurring pricing models,\nread the [pricing model\nguide](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models).\n\n- **Flat-rate pricing**: Charge the same price for each unit. If you use this\noption, select **One time** or **Recurring**.\n- **Package pricing**: Charge by the package, or group of units, such as\ncharging 25 USD for every 5 units. Purchases are rounded up by default, so a\ncustomer buying 8 units pays 50 USD.\n- **Graduated pricing**: Use pricing tiers that might result in a different\nprice for some units in an order. For example, you might charge 10 USD per unit\nfor the first 100 units and then 5 USD per unit for the next 50. If you use this\noption, select the currency for the price and fill in the tier table.\n- **Volume pricing**: Charge the same price for each unit based on the total\nnumber of units sold. For example, you might charge 10 USD per unit for 50\nunits, and 7 USD per unit for 100 units. If you use this option, select the\ncurrency for the price and fill in the tier table.\n- **Customer chooses price**: Let the payer decide on the amount to pay for your\nproduct, service, or cause. **Customer chooses price** is only compatible with\nCheckout and Payment Links.\n- **Usage-based pricing**: Charge your customers based on how much of your\nservice they use during the billing cycle.\n- *(Optional)* If you’re selling in multiple currencies, click **Add another\ncurrency** to set how much to charge in each currency.\n- Select a **Billing period** for recurring prices. You can add a custom period\nif none of the drop-down options are what you want.\n- Select whether to **Include tax in price**. Learn more about [taxes and\nsubscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/taxes).\n- *(Optional)* Enter a **Price description**. Customers don’t see this\ndescription.\n- *(Optional)* Click **Advanced pricing options** if you want to create multiple\nprices for your product.\n- Click **Add product** to save the product and price. You can [edit\nboth](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/manage-prices#edit-product) later.\n\n## Edit a product\n\nDashboardAPI\nTo modify a product in the Dashboard:\n\n- Go to **More** > **Product catalog**.\n- Find the product you want to modify, click the overflow menu (), then click\n**Edit product**.\n- Make your changes to the product.\n- Click **Save product**.\n\nYou can also edit products from within the product information page by clicking\nthe overflow menu () or **Edit**.\n\n## Archive a product\n\nIf you want to disable a product so that it can’t be added to new invoices or\nsubscriptions, you can archive it. If you archive a product, any existing\nsubscriptions that use the product remain active until they’re canceled and any\nexisting payment links that use the product are deactivated. You can’t delete\nproducts that have an associated price, but you can archive them.\n\nDashboardAPI\nTo archive a product:\n\n- Go to **More** > **Product catalog**.\n- Find the product you want to modify, click the overflow menu (), then click\n**Archive product**.\n\nTo unarchive a product:\n\n- Go to the **Archived** tab on the **Product catalog**>**Overview** page.\n- Find the product you want to modify, click the overflow menu (), then click\n**Unarchive product**.\n\nYou can also unarchive a product from the product information page.\n\n## Delete a product\n\nYou can only delete products that have no prices associated with them.\nAlternatively, you can [archive a\nproduct](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/manage-prices#archive-product).\n\nDashboardAPI\nIf a product has a price associated with it, you have to\n[delete](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/manage-prices#delete-price) or\n[archive](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/manage-prices#archive-price)\nthe price before you can delete the product. Stripe keeps a record of the price\nand product for historical transactions.\n\nTo permanently delete a product:\n\n- Go to **More** > **Product catalog**.\n- Find the product you want to modify, click the overflow menu (), then click\n**Delete product**.\n\n## Create a price\n\nYou can create single or multiple prices for a product. For example, Togethere\nmay have a “starter” level offered at 10 USD per month, 100 USD per year, or 9\nEUR as a one-time purchase.\n\n#### Note\n\nAfter you create a price, you can only update its `metadata`, `nickname`, and\n`active` fields.\n\nDashboardAPI\nTo create a price in the Dashboard, you have to [create a\nproduct](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/manage-prices#create-product)\nfirst. Then you can create a price:\n\n- Select a **Pricing model**. For more details about recurring pricing models,\nread the [pricing model\nguide](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models).\n\n- **Flat-rate pricing**: Charge the same price for each unit.

Learn more about [taxes and\nsubscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/taxes).\n- *(Optional)* Enter a **Price description**. Customers don’t see this\ndescription.\n- Click **Create price** to save the price. You can [edit the\nprice](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/manage-prices#edit-price) later.\n\n### Set a default price\n\nA product’s default price is the most common price you want to present to\ncustomers. For example, a product could have multiple prices for seasonal sales,\nbut the default is the regular (non-sale) price. If your product only has one\nprice, that is its default price. The default price must be an\n[active](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/object#price_object-active) Price.\n\nDashboardAPI\nTo change your product’s default price in the Dashboard:\n\n- Go to **More** > **Product catalog**.\n- Find the product you want to modify, click the overflow menu (), then click\n**Edit product**.\n- Under the **Price information** section, find the price you want to set as the\nnew default price, then click **Set as default price**.\n- Click **Save product**.\n\nTo create a new price and make it the new default price in the Dashboard:\n\n- Go to **More** > **Product catalog**.\n- Find the product you want to modify and click on it to open the product\ninformation page.\n- In the **Pricing** section, click the **Add another price** button.\n- Enter your pricing details and select **Set as default price**. Read more\nabout the fields available when you [create a\nprice](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/manage-prices#create-price).\n- Click **Add price**.\n\n### Lookup keys\n\nMost businesses display pricing information on their website. If these prices\nare hard-coded and you want to change them, the process is often manual and\nrequires you to deploy new code. To better manage these scenarios, you can use\nthe\n[lookup_key](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/create#create_price-lookup_key)\nattribute on the [Price\nobject](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/object#price_object). This key allows\nyou to:\n\n- Render different prices in your frontend.\n- Use the rendered price to bill customers.\n\nYou can pass a `lookup_key` when you create a price:\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/prices \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d product={{PRODUCT_ID}} \\\n -d unit_amount=1000 \\\n -d currency=usd \\\n -d \"recurring[interval]\"=month \\\n -d lookup_key=standard_monthly\n```\n\nInstead of hard-coding text like **10 USD per month** on your pricing page and\nusing a price ID on your backend, you can query for the price using the\n`standard_monthly` key and then render that in your frontend:\n\n```\ncurl -G https://api.stripe.com/v1/prices \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d \"lookup_keys[]\"=standard_monthly\n```\n\n#### Note\n\nTo improve performance, you might want to add a caching layer to only reload the\nprice occasionally.\n\nWhen a customer clicks your subscribe or pay button, you pass the price from the\n`GET` request above into the Subscriptions API.\n\nNow that you can render different prices, if you decide that you want to start\ncharging new users 20 USD per month rather than 10 USD per month, you only need\nto create a new price and transfer the lookup key to that new price using\n[transfer_lookup_key=true](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/create#create_price-transfer_lookup_key):\n\n#### Rounding\n\nRounding occurs on the line item level of your\n[invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices). For example, if you create a\nprice with `unit_amount_decimal = 0.05` and a monthly subscription for that\n[price] with `quantity = 30`, rounding occurs after multiplying the quantity by\nthe decimal amount. In this case, the calculated amount for the line item would\nbe `0.05 * 30 = 1.5`, which rounds up to 2 cents. If you have multiple line\nitems, each is rounded up before summing up the total amount for the invoice.\nThis ensures that customers are still charged an integer minor unit amount, as\ndecimal amounts only apply for pricing.\n\nExclusive taxes are added to each line item amount, depending on the tax rate.\nIf you enable [automatic taxes](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/invoicing),\nexclusive taxes are applied and rounded on the total of the invoice, including\ninvoice level discounts. If you use manual taxes on either the line item level\nor the invoice level, you can choose how to apply rounding. Use the [invoice\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/invoice) page in the\nDashboard to apply and round taxes for each line item, or apply and round taxes\non the invoice subtotal.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/prices \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d product={{PRODUCT_ID}} \\\n -d unit_amount=2000 \\\n -d currency=usd \\\n -d \"recurring[interval]\"=month \\\n -d lookup_key=standard_monthly \\\n -d transfer_lookup_key=true\n```\n\n## Edit a price\n\nMultiple properties can be updated on a price, either in the Dashboard or the\nAPI. For example, you can change whether the price is active, or modify its\nmetadata.\n\nNote that you can not change a price’s amount in the API. Instead, we recommend\ncreating a new price for the new amount, switch to the new price’s ID, then\nupdate the old price to be inactive.\n\nDashboardAPI\nTo modify a price in the Dashboard:\n\n- Go to **More** > **Product catalog**.\n- Find the product for the price you want to modify, and click on it\n- Find the price you want to modify, click the overflow menu (), then click\n**Edit price**.\n- Make your changes to the price. You can add another price at this point.\n- Click **Save**.\n\n## Archive a price\n\nIf you want to disable a price so that it can’t be added to new invoices or\nsubscriptions, you can archive it. If you archive a price, any existing\nsubscriptions that use the price remain active until they’re canceled and any\nexisting payment links that use the product are deactivated.\n\nDashboardAPI\nTo archive a price through the Dashboard:\n\n- Go to **More** > **Product catalog**.\n- Find the product you want to modify, click the overflow menu ().\n- On the product information page, find the price you want to modify, then click\nthe overflow menu () next to it and click **Archive price**.\n\nTo unarchive a price:\n\n- Go to **More** > **Product catalog**.\n- Find the product you want to modify, click the overflow menu ().\n- On the product information page, find the price you want to modify, then click\nthe overflow menu () next to it and click **Unarchive price**.\n\n## Delete a price\n\nYou can only delete prices that you’ve never used. Otherwise, you can [archive\nthem](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/manage-prices#archive-price).\n\nDashboardAPI\nTo permanently delete a price in the Dashboard:\n\n- Go to **More** > **Product catalog**.\n- Find the product you want to modify, click the overflow menu ().\n- On the product information page, find the price you want to modify, then click\nthe overflow menu () next to it and click **Delete price**.\n\n## Display pricing information\n\nAfter creating products and prices, you can embed a [pricing\ntable](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/pricing-table) on your website\nto display pricing information to your customers. When customers choose a\nsubscription option, they’re taken directly to checkout.
