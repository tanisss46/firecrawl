  "content": "# Tax reporting\n\n## Learn about different reporting available in Stripe Tax.\n\n#### Note\n\n[Log in](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/tax) or [sign\nup](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register) for Stripe to enable Stripe Tax.\n\nStripe Tax provides reports of completed transactions, and it provides three\ndifferent kinds of reports:\n\n- Itemized exports show a detailed view of completed transactions for all\nlocations, or a country or state.\n- Summarized exports show an aggregated view of completed transactions by\nlocation.\n- Location reports show an aggregated view of completed transactions for your\nregistrations in the US and Canada.\n\nTo access these reports, navigate to the\n[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations) page on the\nDashboard.\n\nIn May 2024, we updated jurisdictions in our location reports, itemized exports,\nand summarized exports for increased consistency across Stripe Tax. These\nchanges include:\n\n- Splitting some jurisdictions into multiple sub-jurisdictions\n- Changing the names of some jurisdictions\n\nAs a result, jurisdiction names in transactions before and after May 2024 might\nnot be identical.\n\n#### Note\n\nIf you work for a platform that pays you via Stripe you’ll need a 1099 form to\nfile your taxes. Visit the [support\nsite](https://support.stripe.com/express/topics/1099-tax-forms) to learn more\nabout how to verify your tax information and receive your forms\n\n## Exports\n\nExports are CSV files that contain details of completed transactions where you\nenabled Stripe Tax. Typically, new transactions become available within a day of\ncompletion.\n\n### Itemized exports\n\nItemized exports contain a detailed view of the line item level tax breakdown\nfor every transaction. You might have multiple rows per line item if you have\nmultiple jurisdictions imposing tax. This amount of detail can help with filing\ntax in jurisdictions that require more details in tax reports.\n\nItemized exports also contain non-taxable transactions. Non-taxable transactions\nare transactions in locations where you’re not registered, in locations that\nStripe Tax doesn’t support, or locations where no jurisdiction imposes tax. You\ncan filter out these transactions by selecting **Exclude non-taxable\ntransactions** when exporting.\n\n#### Sub-state level reportingUnited States\n\nUse itemized exports for US states that require sub-state level reporting.\n\n#### One Stop Shop (OSS)EU\n\nIf you’ve registered for the One Stop Shop (OSS) within the European Union, you\ncan download an itemized export of all your EU transactions. This export can\nassist in preparing your VAT OSS return. Itemized exports include non-taxable\ntransactions (unless purposely excluded) and domestic transactions, which you\ndon’t need to report in an OSS return. Make sure to filter out domestic\ntransactions in your export.\n\n[Download example CSV\nfile](https://d37ugbyn3rpeym.cloudfront.net/docs/files/tax/itemized-export.csv)\n\n### Summarized exports\n\nSummarized exports contain an aggregated view of transactions per jurisdiction.\nIn certain cases, such as when currencies or tax rates vary, you might have\nmultiple rows per jurisdiction.\n\nAll columns account for negative line items generated as a result of\nsubscription prorations or credits for unused time. This helps reconcile your\nsummarized and itemized exports.\n\nSummarized exports don’t contain non-taxable transactions, unlike itemized\nexports.\n\n#### Regional considerations\n\nUse this export for country-level filings and VAT OSS, and for simpler US\nstates.\n\n### Summarized tax transactions\n\nColumn nameDescriptioncountry_code\nTwo-letter ISO code representing the situs country.\n\nfiling_currency\nFiling currency for applicable registration jurisdiction\n\nfiling_tax_payable\nTotal amount of tax payable in filing currency\n\nfiling_total_nontaxable_sales\nTotal amount of nontaxable sales in filing currency\n\nfiling_total_sales\nTotal amount of all sales (not including tax) in filing currency\n\nfiling_total_sales_refunded\nTotal amount of taxable refunds in filing currency\n\nfiling_total_tax_collected\nTotal amount of tax collected in filing currency\n\nfiling_total_tax_refunded\nTotal amount of tax refunded in filing currency\n\nfiling_total_taxable_refunded\nTotal amount of taxable refunds in filing currency.

By consolidating your\ntransactional data, you can:\n\n- Eliminate the need to reconcile and aggregate across different platforms.\n- Stay compliant by having the most accurate view of your tax obligations at all\ntimes.\n\nSign up below if you want to participate in the beta. If selected, we’ll contact\nyou with more information about the next steps.\n\n## Interested in getting early access to the Stripe Tax third-party import tool?\n\nShare your email address to learn more.\n\nCollect EmailSign upRead our [privacy policy](https://stripe.com/privacy).\n## Location reports\n\nLocation reports provide a summary of transaction and refund data aggregated for\nspecific locations. Every location report follows the filing and formatting\nrequirements of the location it’s generated for, and aligns with the specific\nfiling periods of its online filing portal. You can select the **frequency** and\n**period** within the report, as determined by the location.\n\nStripe provides location reports for the US and Canada. You can only view\nlocation reports in the Dashboard and can’t download them.\n\nStripe Tax currently doesn’t support use cases beyond your transaction data,\nsuch as credits, prepayments, discounts, and so on. As a result, the final\nnumbers for your business’s filing might vary.\n\n#### Caution\n\nLocation reports include transactions starting from January 1, 2023, and support\nfiscal annual periods from 2024 onward. To access your transaction data from\n2022, use [itemized](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports#itemized-exports) or\n[summarized](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports#summarized-exports) exports.\n\n### Refunds\n\nLocation reports include refunds associated with an original transaction in the\nsame period as the original transaction, even if the refund occurred much later.\nThis can affect the aggregated amounts in a report. Stripe doesn’t allow the\nreassigning of refunds to alternate periods.\n\n### Tax types\n\nLocation reports support sales or use tax types only.\n\nFor more detailed breakdowns including other tax types, use [itemized\nexports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports#itemized-exports).\n\n### Location specific considerations\n\nThe locations listed below have additional report considerations:\n\n-\n[Alaska](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/united-states/alaska#location-reports)\n-\n[Arizona](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/united-states/arizona#location-reports)\n-\n[Florida](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/united-states/florida#location-reports)\n-\n[Hawaii](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/united-states/hawaii#location-reports)\n-\n[Illinois](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/united-states/illinois#location-reports)\n-\n[Kentucky](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/united-states/kentucky#location-reports)\n-\n[Tennessee](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/united-states/tennessee#location-reports)\n-\n[Washington](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/united-states/washington#location-reports)\n\n## Access data using exports and reports\n\n### Itemized and summarized exports\n\n- Navigate to the **Registrations** page on the Dashboard.\n- Click **Export transactions**.\n- Specify the date range and time zone.\n- Select either **Itemized export** or **Summarized export**. If you selected\n**Itemized export**:- Select the **Columns** you want.\n- Select whether to **Exclude non-taxable transactions** or not.\n- Click **Export**. The export might need time to process.\n\n#### Itemized exports by location\n\n- Navigate to the **Registrations** page on the Dashboard.\n- Click the location you want to generate an export for.\n- Click **Export transactions**.\n- Specify the date range and the time zone.\n- Select the **Columns** you want\n- Select whether to **Exclude non-taxable transactions** or not.\n- Click **Export**. The export might need time to process.\n\n### Location reports\n\n- Navigate to the **Registrations** page on the Dashboard.\n- Click the location whose location report you want to access.\n- Select the **Frequency**.\n- Select the **Period**.\n\n## Scheduled Tax reports\n\nStripe can generate your Tax reports on a schedule.\n\n### Itemized and summarized exports\n\n- Navigate to the **Registrations** page on the Dashboard.\n- Click **Export transactions**.\n- Click **Schedule…**\n- Select the **Schedule** you want to receive your reports by: **Daily**,\n**Weekly**, or **Monthly**. To disable scheduled reports, select **None**.\n- Select **Columns** for **Itemized tax transactions**. We recommend exporting\n**All** columns for completeness.\n- Click **Save**.\n\n### Itemized exports by location\n\n- Navigate to the **Registrations** page on the Dashboard.\n- Click the location you want to schedule Tax reports for.\n- Click **Export transactions**.\n- Click **Schedule…**\n- Select the **Schedule** you want to receive your reports by: **Daily**,\n**Weekly**, or **Monthly**. To disable scheduled reports, select **None**.\n- Select **Columns**. We recommend exporting **All** columns for completeness.\n- Click **Save**.\n\n### Location reports\n\nYou can’t schedule location reports.\n\n## Giving access to your accountant\n\nIf you want to give access to your accountant or other trusted third parties to\naccess your Tax reports, you can [invite them as a team\nmember](https://support.stripe.com/questions/invite-team-members-or-developers-to-access-your-stripe-account).\n\nAfter you invite them, your accountant (or others) can perform the same steps\ndescribed above to access location reports, itemized, and summarized exports.\n\n#### Security tip\n\nGive your users the smallest set of permissions possible that they can still\nperform their duties with.\n\nFor accessing Tax reports, we recommend the **View Only** role. See [user\nroles](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/teams/roles) to learn what\nthis role can and can’t do.\n\n## Tax calculations recorded in reports\n\nStripe Tax exports include transactions created using [Stripe Tax\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/custom) and operations on Stripe objects with\n`automatic_tax[enabled]=true`.\n\n#### Note\n\nWe consider transactions effective on the date they finalize and we don’t\nrecalculate taxes afterwards.\n\nThe following operations *increase* the balance of total tax reported:\n\n- The customer completes a payment in a Checkout Session. This also applies to\nCheckout Sessions created through [Payment\nLinks](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_links/payment_links).\n- [Finalizing](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/finalize) an invoice. This\napplies to one-off invoices and recurring (subscription) invoices. [Invoice\nfinalization](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/workflow-transitions)\nhappens when the state of the invoice transitions from a `draft` to an `open`\nstate. This transition happens *before* the invoice is paid.\n- Transitioning the state of an invoice from `uncollectible` to `paid` through\nthe [Pay Invoices API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay).\n- [Voiding](https://docs.stripe.com/api/credit_notes/void) a credit note.\n-\n[Creating](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax/transactions/create_from_calculation)\na tax transaction using the Stripe Tax API.\n\nThe following operations *decrease* the balance of total tax reported:\n\n- [Voiding](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/void) an invoice.\n- [Marking](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/mark_uncollectible) an invoice\nas uncollectible.\n- [Creating](https://docs.stripe.com/api/credit_notes/create) a credit note.\n- [Creating](https://docs.stripe.com/api/refunds) a refund of a charge\nassociated with an invoice or a Checkout Session.\n- [Creating a\nreversal](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax/transactions/create_reversal) of a tax\ntransaction using the Stripe Tax API.\n\nThe following operations aren’t reflected in Tax reports:\n\n- [Disputes](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes) that are upheld by the\ncardholder’s bank. Stripe Tax doesn’t decrease the balance of the collected\ntotal tax.\n- Refunds of [uncaptured\namounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/capture#capture_payment_intent-amount_to_capture)\nof a payment. This can happen when performing a [partial\ncapture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/capture#capture_payment_intent-amount_to_capture)\nfor payments of Checkout sessions using\n[capture_method=manual](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-payment_intent_data-capture_method).\nWhen the capture amount is lower than the original amount, Stripe Tax doesn’t\nreduce the total balance of the collected tax.\n\n## Tax data in Sigma and Data Pipeline\n\nIf you want to create tailored reports for your specific needs, sign up for\n[Sigma](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data/access-data-in-dashboard) or [Data\nPipeline](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data/access-data-in-warehouse).
