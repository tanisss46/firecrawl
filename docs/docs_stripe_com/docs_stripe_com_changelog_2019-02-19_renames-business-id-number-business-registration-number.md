# Renames the business_id_number for an account's legal entity to business_registration_numberBreaking changes

## What’s new

Renames the `legal_entity[business_id_number]` field to
`legal_entity[business_registration_number]`.

## Impact

You need to update your code to use the new field name when providing or
accessing business registration information. This modification provides more
clarity about the nature of the information being requested, but requires
updates to existing code that handles business entity data.
