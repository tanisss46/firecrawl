  "content": "# PayNow payments\n\n## Learn about PayNow, a popular payment method in Singapore.\n\nPayNow is a Singapore based payment method that allows customers to make a\npayment using their preferred app from participating banks and participating\nnon-bank financial institutions.\n\nCustomers see a QR code when checking out with PayNow. They complete the payment\nby scanning it using [a participating\napp](https://www.abs.org.sg/consumer-banking/pay-now). You receive confirmation\nfrom Stripe instantly when they complete the payment.\n\nPayment method propertiesBusiness locationsProduct support- **Customer\nlocations**\n\nSingapore\n- **Presentment currency**\n\nSGD\n- **Payment confirmation**\n\nCustomer-initiated\n- **Payment method family**\n\nReal-time payments\n- **Billing support**\n\n[Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/paynow#billing)\n- **Payout timing**\n\nT+1 availability\n- **Connect support**\n\nYes\n- **Dispute support**\n\n[Not applicable](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/paynow#disputed-payments)\n- **Manual capture support**\n\nNo\n- **Refunds / Partial refunds**\n\n[Yes / Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/paynow#refunds)\n- **Pricing**\n\n1.3\n\n## Get started\n\nYou don’t have to integrate PayNow and other payment methods individually. If\nyou use our front-end products, Stripe automatically determines the most\nrelevant payment methods to display. Go to the [Stripe\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and enable\nPayNow. To get started with one of our hosted UIs, follow a quickstart:\n\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart): Our prebuilt, hosted\ncheckout page.\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart): Our drop-in UI\ncomponents.\n\n### Other payment products\n\nThe following Stripe products also let you add PayNow from the Dashboard:\n\n- [Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/no-code-guide)\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n- [Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview)\n\nIf your integration requires manually listing payment methods, learn how to\n[manually configure PayNow as a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/paynow/accept-a-payment).\n\n## Refunds\n\nYou can refund PayNow payments up to 90 days after the original payment. Refunds\nfor PayNow payments are asynchronous and Stripe notifies you of the final refund\nstatus using the `refund.updated` or `refund.failed`\n[webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) event. When a refund succeeds, the\nstatus of the [Refund](https://docs.stripe.com/api/refunds/object) object\ntransitions to `succeeded`.\n\nIf a refund fails, the status of the Refund object transitions to `failed` and\nStripe returns the amount to your Stripe balance. At this point, you need to\narrange an alternative way of providing your customer with a refund.\n\n## Statement descriptors\n\nCustomized statement descriptors aren’t supported by PayNow, the value specified\nin the\n[statement_descriptor](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-statement_descriptor)\nis ignored. Stripe’s company name (`STRIPE PAYMENTS SINGAPORE PTE. LTD.`) is\nshown when your customers complete payments on their mobile app. It’s also shown\non bank statements along with the amount and a Stripe-generated reference code.\n\n## Repeated payments\n\nTo prevent your customers from being charged multiple times, after your customer\nsuccessfully completes a transaction, any subsequent attempts to pay using the\nsame QR code are rejected. The rejection behavior depends on the bank and\npayment app used by the customer to attempt the transaction. If your customers\ncontact you about repeated payments, you can advise them to check for text\nmessages or notifications from their bank or payment app, which will show that\nthe payment attempt was rejected.\n\n## Billing\n\nUse [Stripe Billing](https://stripe.com/billing) to create PayNow supported\n[subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating) and\n[invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices).\n\nPayNow payments don’t support [automatically\ncharging](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/automatic-charging) invoices. You\nneed to configure invoices and subscriptions with `send_invoice`\n[collection_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-collection_method).\n\n## Payout timing\n\nBy default, it takes 1 day from the time of the transaction for the funds to be\navailable in your Stripe balance. Stripe pays out available funds to your bank\naccount according to the payout schedule set on your Stripe account.\n\nFor example, if the payment was made on Wednesday, the funds are available in\nyour Stripe balance on Thursday. If you’re on an automatic daily payout\nschedule, the funds are paid out on Thursday. If you’re on a weekly (Monday)\npayout schedule, the funds are paid out on the coming Monday.\n\n## Disputes\n\nPayNow payments have a low risk of fraud or unrecognized payments because the\ncustomer must authenticate the payment through participating apps. As a result,\nthere’s no dispute process that can result in a chargeback and funds being\nwithdrawn from your Stripe account.\n\n## Prohibited business categories\n\nIn addition to the categories of [businesses restricted from using Stripe\noverall](https://stripe.com/restricted-businesses), the following categories are\nspecifically prohibited from using PayNow:\n\n- Petroleum and Petroleum Products\n- Fuel Dealers\n- Service Stations\n- Automated Fuel Dispensers\n\n## Links\n\n- [a participating app](https://www.abs.org.sg/consumer-banking/pay-now)\n- [Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/paynow#billing)\n- [Not applicable](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/paynow#disputed-payments)\n- [Yes / Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/paynow#refunds)\n- [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods)\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart)\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart)\n- [Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/no-code-guide)\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n- [Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview)\n- [manually configure PayNow as a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/paynow/accept-a-payment)\n- [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks)\n- [Refund](https://docs.stripe.com/api/refunds/object)\n-\n[statement_descriptor](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-statement_descriptor)\n- [Stripe Billing](https://stripe.com/billing)\n- [subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating)\n- [invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n- [automatically charging](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/automatic-charging)\n-\n[collection_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-collection_method)\n- [businesses restricted from using Stripe\noverall](https://stripe.com/restricted-businesses)",
