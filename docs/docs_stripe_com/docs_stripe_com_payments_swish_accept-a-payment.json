We\nrecommend that you configure your payment methods from the Stripe Dashboard\nusing the instructions in [Accept a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web&ui=stripe-hosted).\n\nIf you want to continue manually configuring the payment methods you present to\nyour customers with Checkout, use this guide. Otherwise, update your integration\nto [configure payment methods in the\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/dashboard-payment-methods).\n\nUse this guide to enable Swish on\n[Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout), our hosted checkout form,\nand learn the differences between accepting a card payment and a Swish payment.\n\n[Determine\ncompatibility](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/swish/accept-a-payment#compatibility)\nA Checkout Session must satisfy all of the following conditions to support Swish\npayments:\n\n- [Prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices) for all line items must be\nexpressed in SEK.\n[Set up\nStripeServer-side](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/swish/accept-a-payment#web-set-up-stripe)\nFirst, you need a Stripe account.

If no action is taken after 3 minutes, the\n[PaymentMethod](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object) is detached\nand the [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object)\nobject’s status automatically transitions to `requires_payment_method`.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Checkout fulfillment](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/fulfillment)\n- [Customizing\nCheckout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/customization)\n\n## Links\n\n- [single-use](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#usage)\n- [authenticate and\napprove](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#customer-actions)\n- [immediate\nnotification](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#payment-notification)\n- [Accept a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web&ui=stripe-hosted)\n- [configure payment methods in the\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/dashboard-payment-methods)\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout)\n- [Prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices)\n- [Register now](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register)\n- [accept a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?integration=checkout)\n- [Checkout Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions)\n- [https://example.com/success](https://example.com/success)\n- [https://example.com/cancel](https://example.com/cancel)\n- [fulfill orders](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/fulfillment)\n- [PaymentMethod](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object)\n- [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object)\n- [Customizing\nCheckout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/customization)",
