# Export Bacs data from Stripe

## Learn how to export your Bacs data from Stripe to another payment processor.

You can migrate your data from your Stripe account to a new payment processor
using the Bacs bulk change process. We work with other payment processors and
Bacs sponsor banks throughout the migration to securely migrate your Bacs data.
A Bacs migration takes at least 6 weeks to complete.

To import Bacs data from another payment processor to Stripe, see [Import Bacs
data from Stripe](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bacs-debit/import-data).

[Submit your Bacs export migration
request](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bacs-debit/export-data#submit-bacs-request)
Start the migration process by submitting a data migration request.

- Navigate to the [Stripe Support form for data
migrations](https://support.stripe.com/contact/email?topic=migrations). If
youâ€™re not signed in, select **Sign in** and enter the credentials of the
account that you want to migrate your data from.
- Select **Export data out of Stripe to a third party**.
- Select **Bacs** as the data type you want to export.
- Complete the remaining fields and select **Send email**.

Our data migrations team emails you within 3 business days of receiving your
request.

[Print, sign, and send your Bulk Change
Deed](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bacs-debit/export-data#sign-bulk-change-deed)
Your new Bacs provider must print and sign a bulk change deed. This agreement
authorizes the transfer of your mandates from Stripe to your new payment
processor.

#### Caution

[Sign

to download the bulk change deed.

[Determine your switch
date](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bacs-debit/export-data#determine-switch-date)
After we receive your bulk change deed, our Data Migrations team works with you,
your new payment processor, and their sponsor bank to agree on a switch date.

[Wait for your data
export](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bacs-debit/export-data#wait-for-export)
Our Data Migrations team exports your data and cancels your existing Bacs
mandates on the agreed-upon date. This step is irreversible and removes the
ability to create charges on these mandates through Stripe.

We control the timing of the export of data from Stripe. There are other tasks
that your new processor and their sponsor bank must complete when importing the
data.

See [Bacs Direct Debit payments in the
UK](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/bacs-debit) for more
information.
