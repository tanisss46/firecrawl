It’s also available in the [Reports\nhub](https://dashboard.stripe.com/reports/hub) in your Stripe Dashboard. Margin\nReports are only available in live mode, not in test mode or sandboxes.\n- Using the month picker, select the **time-period**, then click **Download** on\nyour desired Margin Report type. The report for a month is available 7 days\nafter the end of that month.\n\n## User access\n\nUsers with the following [user\nroles](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/teams/roles) can access the\nMargin Reports:\n\n- Administrator\n- Analyst\n- Data Migration Specialist\n- Developer\n- Tax Analyst\n- View only\n\n## Margin report data\n\nMargin reports include charges based on the timestamp of the originating event,\nnot the timestamp when a fee is assessed. For example, to view a fee assessed on\nFebruary 1 for a charge created on January 31, run the report for January. These\nreports only support platforms that [explicitly state an application\nfee](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges?fee-type=application-fee#collect-fees),\neither directly in the API or through [Platform Pricing\nTools](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/platform-pricing-tools). They don’t\ninclude revenue from account debits or\n[transfer_data.amount](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges?fee-type=transfer-amount#collect-fees).\n\nA margin report includes data for the following types of charges:\n\n- [Connect direct charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges) where\nthe platform collects application fees\n- [Destination charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges)\nwhere the platform collects application fees, with or without on_behalf_of\n\nIt also includes application fees and Stripe fees paid for [Instant\nPayouts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/instant-payouts).\n\nIt doesn’t include data for the following types of charges:\n\n- Direct charges where the connected account is responsible for fees\n- Direct charges on the platform (such as SaaS subscriptions they run on the\nsame account)\n- Separate charges and transfers\n- Direct charges initiated by a connected account\n- Direct charges for connected accounts that are no longer connected to your\nplatform when you generate the report\n\n#### Note\n\nA margin report normalizes all values to USD using the conversion rate at the\ntime of activity. We plan to add other normalization currencies in a future\nrelease.\n\n## Available columns for each margin report\n\nThe Summary and Connected Account margin reports show aggregated monthly data,\nwhereas the Transaction margin report shows data for individual transactions.\n\n#### Note\n\nThe total amounts shown in the Summary and Connected Account margin reports are\nnormally greater than the sum of the amounts in the Transaction margin report.\nThat’s because the Transaction report includes only fees that apply at a\ntransaction level. It doesn’t include out-of-band fees, such as Card Account\nUpdater fees or non-transactional scheme fees.\n\n### Summary margin report\n\nThis report shows the aggregated volume, revenue, and fees for the platform for\nthe entire selected month. You can calculate the net volume, revenue, or fees as\nthe sum of all values in their category. To determine the net margin, add the\nnet revenue and net fees.\n\nYou can calculate net take rate in several ways. One common method is (net\nmargin)/net volume)×10000.\n\nAmount fields include:\n\n- **subtotal_amount**: Amount excluding any tax\n- **tax_amount**: Amount of tax\n- **total_amount**: sum of `subtotal_amount` and `tax_amount`\n\nThe Summary margin report includes the following data for the selected time\nperiod:\n\nTypeCategoryDescriptionVolume Charges, Payment method = {payment method}Volume\nof charges for the {payment method} payment methodRefundsVolume of\nrefundsDisputesVolume of disputesRevenue Application fee, payment method =\n{payment method}Amount of application fees for the {payment method} payment\nmethodApplication fee refundsAmount of application fees refunded by the\nplatformNetwork fee (assessed by card networks) Card payments - Transaction\nnetwork costsInterchange (or discount, for Amex) fees and transaction-level\nscheme fees; a single charge typically incurs one interchange fee and one or\nmore scheme feesCard payments - Other network costsNon-transactional scheme fees\nsuch as FANF (Fixed Acquirer Network Fee from Visa) directly attributable to a\nconnected accountCard payments - Other network costs (platform\nlevel)Non-transactional scheme fees directly attributable to the platform\nitselfStripe fee Stripe processing fees - {payment method}Stripe processing fees\nfor cards and other payment methodsConnect - {fee type}Connect fees, such as\nAccount Volume Billing, Active Account Billing, and (for Stripe Managed Risk and\nSupport) Loss LiabilityVariesOther product fees that apply to the platform and\nare directly attributable to a connected account, such as for Radar and Card\nAccount UpdaterVaries (platform level)Other product fees that apply to the\nplatform and are directly attributable to the platform itself, such as Card\nAccount Updater fees for cards created on the platform\nDisconnecting an account from your platform can affect the values in the Summary\nmargin report.\n\n### Connected Account margin report\n\nThis report shows all volume, revenue, and fees attributed to each connected\naccount for the entire selected month. It doesn’t include any connected accounts\nthat have been deleted or disconnected from your platform. You can use it to\nunderstand which connected accounts are margin-positive, margin-neutral, or\nmargin-negative for your platform.\n\nBecause fees appear as negative numbers, you can calculate a connected account’s\nmargin as the sum of its associated revenues and fees.\n\nConnected account detail fields include:\n\n- **connected_account_id**: Unique identifier of the connected account\nassociated with the charge\n- **business_name**\n- **display_name**\n- **connected_account_country**: Two-letter ISO code representing the country of\nthe transaction account\n\nThe Connected

volume, revenue, and fees for\nthe entire selected month. It doesn’t include non-transactional revenue or fees.\nYou can use it to understand which transactions are margin-positive,\nmargin-neutral, or margin-negative.\n\nBecause fees appear as negative numbers, you can calculate a transaction’s\nmargin as the sum of its associated revenues and fees.\n\n#### Note\n\nDon’t use the Transaction margin report to understand profitability at the level\nof a connected account. Use the Connected Account margin report.\n\nCharge detail fields include:\n\n- **charge_id**: Unique identifier of the charge\n- **connected_account_id**: Unique identifier of the connected account\nassociated with the charge\n- **activity_at**: Time in UTC at which we attribute the line item\n- **payment_method_type**: Type of payment method used for the transaction, such\nas `card`, `ACH credit transfer`, or `link`\n- **card_funding**: Card [funding\ntype](https://docs.stripe.com/api/external_account_cards/object#account_card_object-funding);\ncan be `credit`, `debit`, `prepaid`, or `unknown`\n- **card_brand**: Card [brand](https://docs.stripe.com/api#card_object-brand);\ncan be `American Express`, `Diners Club`, `Discover`, `Eftpos Australia`, `JCB`,\n`MasterCard`, `UnionPay`, `Visa`, or `Unknown`\n- **card_network**: Identifies which\n[network](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-payment_method_details-card-network)\nprocessed the transaction;
