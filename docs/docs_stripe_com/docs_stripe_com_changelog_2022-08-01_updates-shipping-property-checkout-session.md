# Updates Checkout Session shipping properties Breaking changes

## What’s new

Updates several Checkout Session resource shipping properties:

- Moves `shipping_rate` into the new `shipping_cost` hash.
- Renames `shipping` to `shipping_details`.

## Impact

Lets you clearly differentiate between the shipping rate information and the
broader shipping details. By separating `shipping_rate` into its own
`shipping_cost` hash, and renaming `shipping` to `shipping_details`, you can
more granularly access and manage various shipped-related properties within a
Checkout Session.
