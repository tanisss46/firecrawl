# Accounts in the US now require specifying capabilities at creation timeBreaking changes

## What’s new

Starting with the 2019-02-19 API, the `requested_capabilities` property is now
required at creation time for accounts in the U.S. To learn more, see [Account
capabilities](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities).

## Impact

This change mandates the inclusion of the `requested_capabilities` property when
creating accounts in the U.S. You must now explicitly specify the capabilities
they want for new accounts, which provides more control over account
functionalities.
