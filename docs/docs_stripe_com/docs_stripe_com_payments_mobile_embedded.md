## Embed a payment method selector anywhere in your app.

The Embedded Payment Element is a customizable drop-in component that embeds a
list of payment methods on any screen in your app. When a payment method is
selected from the list, a bottom sheet collects payment details.

The Embedded Payment Element offers you the flexibility to integrate payment
methods anywhere within your appâ€™s interface. For example, you can use the
Embedded Payment Element to:

- Display the payment method options directly on your checkout screen, allowing
users to view and select their payment method without the need for a separate
sheet.
- Integrate the payment method list into your existing payment methods screen
with other items like coupon selection.

For developers seeking a prebuilt and customizable solution for payment
processing, use the [Payment
Sheet](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements/mobile-payment-element#integration-options)
instead. If you require additional control over where to place the payment
method list, use the Embedded Payment Element. To learn more about these
solutions, see [Mobile Payment
Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements/mobile-payment-element).
