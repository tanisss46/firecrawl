Stripe works to reduce decline rates across all\nsupported payment methods. We work with issuers and networks to improve\nacceptance rates, often without affecting your integration.\n\nThere are three reasons why a payment might fail:\n\n- [Issuer declines](https://docs.stripe.com/declines#issuer-declines)\n- [Blocked payments](https://docs.stripe.com/declines#blocked-payments)\n- [Invalid API calls](https://docs.stripe.com/declines#invalid-api-calls)\n\nYou need to handle each type of payment failure differently. For every failure,\nyou can use the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments) or API to\nreview a payment’s details. When using the API, look at the `Charge` object’s\n[outcome](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-outcome).\nThis attribute covers the payment failure type and provides information about\nits cause.\n\nStripe handles non-card payment method declines similarly to card declines.\nStripe sends you a response code that includes information about the decline,\nfor example, if it’s due to insufficient funds, a lost or stolen card, or\nanother reason.\n\n## Issuer declines\n\nWhen your customer’s card issuer receives a charge, their automated systems and\nmodels decide whether to authorize it. These tools analyze signals such as\nspending habits, account balance, and card data (expiration date, address\ninformation, and CVC).\n\nIf the card issuer declines a payment, Stripe shares with you all of the decline\ninformation we receive. This information is available in the Dashboard and\nthrough the API. When issuers provide specific explanations, such as an\nincorrect card number or low funds, these explanations return to Stripe through\n[decline codes](https://docs.stripe.com/declines/codes).\n\n## Blocked payments\n\n[Stripe Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) blocks high risk payments, such as\nthose with mismatched CVC or postal code values. This automated fraud prevention\nproduct evaluates each payment, without requiring any action from you.\n\n![A payment that Radar\ndeclined](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/payment-high-risk-allow-list.1dd70f2d0e26384f44e8eeeb59eaf533.png)\n\nA payment that Radar declined\n\nWhen Stripe blocks a payment, it obtains initial authorization from the card\nissuer but refrains from charging the card. This precaution helps prevent\npotential fraudulent payments that might lead to disputes.\n\nFor some card types, customers might see the card issuer’s authorization for the\npayment amount on their statement. However, Stripe hasn’t charged this amount or\nwithdrawn funds. The card issuer typically removes this authorization from the\ncustomer’s statement within a few days.\n\nIf a rule you configured blocks a payment you recognize as legitimate, you can\nlift the block by locating the payment in the\n[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments) and clicking **Add to allow\nlist**. This action doesn’t retry the payment. Instead, it overrides all of your\nother rules from blocking future payment attempts that match the list attribute.\n\n#### Note\n\nDon’t see the **Add to allow list** button on the payment details page? [Contact\nStripe](https://support.stripe.com/email) to add this feature to your Radar\naccount.\n\nWhen using the API, the `outcome` of a blocked payment reflects the type of\npayment failure and the reason for it, along with the evaluated risk level.\n\n```\n...\noutcome: {\n network_decline_code: null,\n network_advice_code: null,\n network_status: \"not_sent_to_network\",\n reason: \"highest_risk_level\",\n advice_code: \"do_not_try_again\",\n risk_level: \"highest\",\n seller_message: \"Stripe blocked this charge as too risky.\",\n type: \"blocked\"\n},\n...\n```\n\n## Invalid API calls\n\nIn the API, you might see an invalid API call like the following:\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/charges \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d amount=2000 \\\n -d currency=usd \\\n -d source=tok_invalid \\\n --data-urlencode description=\"Charge for jenny.rosen@example.com\"\n```\n\nThe invalid API call generates an error response that might look like this:\n\n```\n{\n \"error\": {\n \"code\": \"invalid_number\",\n \"doc_url\": \"https://docs.stripe.com/error-codes#invalid-number\",\n \"message\": \"Your card number is incorrect.\",\n \"param\": \"card[number]\",\n \"type\": \"card_error\"\n }\n}\n```\n\nThe [outcome](https://docs.stripe.com/api#charge_object-outcome) of a declined\npayment includes the type of payment failure and the\n[reason](https://docs.stripe.com/api#charge_object-outcome-reason), based on the\ncard issuer’s decline code. The reason might contain information other than the\nissuer’s response code, for example, if a Radar rule evaluation blocked the\ncharge.\n\n```\n...\noutcome: {\n network_decline_code: \"54\",\n network_advice_code: \"01\",\n network_status: \"declined_by_network\",\n reason: \"expired_card\",\n advice_code: \"do_not_try_again\",\n risk_level: \"normal\",\n seller_message: \"The bank returned the decline code `expired_card`.\",\n type: \"issuer_declined\"\n},\n...\n```\n\nAs you develop your Stripe integration, continuously\n[test](https://docs.stripe.com/testing) it to identify any potential bugs that\nmight lead to invalid API calls. Invalid API calls typically don’t result in a\npayment appearing in your Dashboard. However, you might see the payment appear\nin a few cases.\n\n```\n...\noutcome: {\n network_decline_code: null,\n network_advice_code: null,\n network_status: \"not_sent_to_network\",\n type: \"invalid\"\n},\n...\n```\n\n## See also\n\n- [Card declines](https://docs.stripe.com/declines/card)\n- [Test declined\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/testing?testing-method=card-numbers#declined-payments)\n- [Refund and cancel payments](https://docs.stripe.com/refunds)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Issuer declines](https://docs.stripe.com/declines#issuer-declines)\n- [Blocked payments](https://docs.stripe.com/declines#blocked-payments)\n- [Invalid API calls](https://docs.stripe.com/declines#invalid-api-calls)\n- [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments)\n- [outcome](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-outcome)\n- [decline codes](https://docs.stripe.com/declines/codes)\n- [Stripe Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar)\n- [Contact Stripe](https://support.stripe.com/email)\n-\n[https://docs.stripe.com/error-codes#invalid-number](https://docs.stripe.com/error-codes#invalid-number)\n- [outcome](https://docs.stripe.com/api#charge_object-outcome)\n- [reason](https://docs.stripe.com/api#charge_object-outcome-reason)\n- [test](https://docs.stripe.com/testing)\n- [Card declines](https://docs.stripe.com/declines/card)\n- [Test declined\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/testing?testing-method=card-numbers#declined-payments)\n- [Refund and cancel payments](https://docs.stripe.com/refunds)",
