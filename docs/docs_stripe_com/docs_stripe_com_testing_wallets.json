Use the demo to visually compare how these wallets\ndisplay in the demo integrations and your own integration.\n\n- If the Apple Pay and Google Pay payment options appear as expected and in both\nthe demo and your integration, they’re configured correctly.\n- If you have a valid wallet, but you don’t see it as a payment method option in\nthe demo, [adjust your device and browser\nsetup](https://docs.stripe.com/testing/wallets#device-requirements) until Apple\nPay and Google Pay appear as expected.\n- If you see your wallet displayed in the demos but not in your own integration,\n[check your\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/testing/wallets#integration-requirements).\nPayment ElementExpress Checkout ElementCheckout SessionsPayment Request\nButtonLegacyThis demo only displays Google Pay or Apple Pay if you have an\nactive card with either wallet.\nFor this integration path, Stripe.js detects and supports the following wallets\nbased on the state of your device.\n\n```\n{  applePay: false  googlePay: false}\n```\n\n## Check your device and browser setup\n\nIf you can’t see your expected wallet in the demos, your device or browser might\nnot meet the following Apple Pay or Google Pay conditions.\n\n- The wallet must have at least one card.\n- You must use a compatible [Apple Pay\ndevice](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102896) and [Google Pay\ndevice](https://developers.google.com/pay/issuers/overview/supported-devices#compatibility_requirements).\n- You must use a [supported\nversion](https://docs.stripe.com/js/appendix/supported_browsers) of a [supported\nbrowser](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-js/elements/payment-request-button?client=html#testing)\nfor the wallet you’re testing.\n#### Note\n\nThis integration relies on the [Payment Request\nAPI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Payment_Request_API),\nwhich Android WebViews doesn’t support.\n- Allow applicable browsers to access your wallet.- Chrome: **Settings** >\n**Autofill and passwords** > **Payment methods** > **Allow sites to check if you\nhave payment methods saved**\n- Safari: **Settings** > **Advanced** > **Allow websites to check for Apple Pay\nand Apple card**\n- Don’t use a Chrome incognito window or Safari private window.\n- Confirm you’re operating from a supported [Apple Pay\nregion](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102775) and [Google Pay\nregion](https://support.google.com/wallet/answer/12060037?sjid=7404612469520417090-NA#zippy=%2Cuse-google-wallet-for-payments).\n- Stripe doesn’t display Apple Pay or Google Pay for IP addresses in India.\n- For Apple Pay, confirm your device supports [biometric\nauthentication](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102626#:~:text=iPhone%20or%20.iPad,on%20all%20devices.).\n\n## Check your integration\n\nIf you see the expected wallet payment methods in the demo payment forms, but\nthey don’t display in your own integration, the following checkpoints might\nresolve the issue.\n\n### Register your domains\n\nCheck your [Stripe\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_method_domains) to\nconfirm your domain registrations. You must [register every domain and\nsub-domain](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/pmd-registration?dashboard-or-api=dashboard#register-your-domain)\nseparately for each environment, including live mode and each\n[sandbox](https://docs.stripe.com/sandboxes).\n\nConnect users must also consider the funds flow configuration (direct or\ndestination charge) for correct [domain\nregistration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/pmd-registration?dashboard-or-api=dashboard#register-your-domain-while-using-connect).\n\n### (Apple Pay) Register all domains when using iframes\n\nTo see Apple Pay in an integration using iframes you must:\n\n- Make sure the iframe and top-level site domains match if you support\npre-Safari 17 browser versions.\n- Set the `allow=\"payment\"` attribute on the iframe.\n- Register both the iframe domain and top-level domain of the site, if they’re\ndifferent (supported by Safari 17 or later).\n\n### Enable wallets for your integration\n\n- Enable supported wallets in your [Payment Method\nConfigurations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/payment_methods) to\nmake sure [Dynamic Payment\nMethods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/dynamic-payment-methods)\ncan render them.\n- To manually specify wallet payment methods, include `payment_method_types=\n['card']` when:- [Creating the payment\nintent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-payment_method_types)\n- [Initializing\nElements](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_without_intent#stripe_elements_no_intent-options-paymentMethodTypes)\nfrom your client to collect payment details [before creating an\nIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment-deferred).\n\n## Links\n\n- [Apple Pay device](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102896)\n- [Google Pay\ndevice](https://developers.google.com/pay/issuers/overview/supported-devices#compatibility_requirements)\n- [supported version](https://docs.stripe.com/js/appendix/supported_browsers)\n- [supported\nbrowser](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-js/elements/payment-request-button?client=html#testing)\n- [Payment Request\nAPI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Payment_Request_API)\n- [Apple Pay region](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102775)\n- [Google Pay\nregion](https://support.google.com/wallet/answer/12060037?sjid=7404612469520417090-NA#zippy=%2Cuse-google-wallet-for-payments)\n- [biometric\nauthentication](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102626#:~:text=iPhone%20or%20.iPad,on%20all%20devices.)\n- [Stripe\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_method_domains)\n- [register every domain and\nsub-domain](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/pmd-registration?dashboard-or-api=dashboard#register-your-domain)\n- [sandbox](https://docs.stripe.com/sandboxes)\n- [domain\nregistration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/pmd-registration?dashboard-or-api=dashboard#register-your-domain-while-using-connect)\n- [Payment Method\nConfigurations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/payment_methods)\n- [Dynamic Payment\nMethods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/dynamic-payment-methods)\n- [Creating the payment\nintent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-payment_method_types)\n- [Initializing\nElements](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_without_intent#stripe_elements_no_intent-options-paymentMethodTypes)\n- [before creating an\nIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment-deferred)",
