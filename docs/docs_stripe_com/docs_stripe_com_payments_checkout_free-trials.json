  "content": "# Configure free trials\n\n## Delay payments on subscriptions using free trial periods.\n\nStripe doesn’t set a specific limit on a free trial length. Most businesses use\nshorter trials (such as 30 days), but you can set longer periods. However,\nconsider:\n\n- Keeping payment methods valid for post-trial charges\n- Potential impact on conversion rates with longer trials\nStripe-hosted pageEmbedded formEmbedded componentsPublic preview\nYou can configure a Checkout Session to start a customer’s subscription with a\nfree trial by passing one of the following parameters:\n\n-\n[subscription_data.trial_period_days](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-subscription_data-trial_period_days),\nthe length (in days) of your free trial.\n-\n[subscription_data.trial_end](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-subscription_data-trial_end),\na Unix timestamp representing the end of the trial period.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/checkout/sessions \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d mode=subscription \\\n --data-urlencode success_url=\"https://example.com/success\" \\\n --data-urlencode cancel_url=\"https://example.com/cancel\" \\\n -d \"line_items[0][price]\"={{PRICE_ID}} \\\n -d \"line_items[0][quantity]\"=1 \\\n -d \"subscription_data[trial_period_days]\"=30\n```\n\n## Free trials without collecting a payment method\n\nBy default, Checkout Sessions collect a payment method to use after the trial\nends. You can sign customers up for free trials without collecting payment\ndetails by passing\n[payment_method_collection=if_required](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-payment_method_collection).\n\nChoose whether to cancel or pause the subscription if the customer doesn’t\nprovide a payment method before the trial ends by passing\n[trial_settings.end_behavior.missing_payment_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-subscription_data-trial_settings-end_behavior-missing_payment_method).\n\n- **Cancel subscription**-If the free trial subscription ends without a payment\nmethod, it cancels immediately. You can create another subscription if the\ncustomer decides to subscribe to a paid plan in the future.\n- **Pause subscription**-If the free trial subscription ends without a payment\nmethod, it pauses and doesn’t cycle until it’s resumed. When a subscription is\npaused, it doesn’t generate invoices (unlike when a subscription’s [payment\ncollection](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/pause-payment) is\npaused). When your customer adds their payment method after the subscription has\npaused, you can resume the same subscription. The subscription can remain paused\nindefinitely.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/checkout/sessions \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d mode=subscription \\\n --data-urlencode success_url=\"https://example.com/success\" \\\n --data-urlencode cancel_url=\"https://example.com/cancel\" \\\n -d \"line_items[0][price]\"={{PRICE_ID}} \\\n -d \"line_items[0][quantity]\"=1 \\\n -d \"subscription_data[trial_period_days]\"=30 \\\n-d\n\"subscription_data[trial_settings][end_behavior][missing_payment_method]\"=cancel\n\\\n -d payment_method_collection=if_required\n```\n\n### Collect payment details automatically\n\nBefore the trial expires, collect payment details from your customer.\n\nUnder **Manage free trial messaging** in your [Subscriptions and emails\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/automatic), you can\nchoose to automatically send a reminder email when a customer’s trial is about\nto expire.\n\nNext, select the **Link to a Stripe-hosted page** option so the reminder email\ncontains a link for the customer to add or update their payment details. We\ndon’t send free trial reminder emails in a sandbox. Learn more about how to [set\nup free trial\nreminders](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/revenue-recovery/customer-emails#trial-ending-reminders).\n\nYou must comply with card network requirements when offering trials. Learn more\nabout [compliance requirements for trials and\npromotions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/trials#compliance).\n\n### Collect payment details in the Billing customer portal\n\nYou can also send the reminder email yourself, and redirect customers to the\nBilling customer portal to add their payment details.\n\nFirst, configure the [Billing customer\nportal](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management) to enable your customers to\nmanage their subscriptions.\n\nNext, collect billing information from your customers:\n\n- Listen to the `customer.subscription.trial_will_end`\n[event](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-customer.subscription.trial_will_end).\n- If the subscription doesn’t have a [default payment\nmethod](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-default_payment_method),\nget the customer’s email using the [Customers\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/retrieve) and send them a message\nwith a link to your site. It’s helpful to embed the customer ID in the email,\nfor example `https://example.com?...&customer={{CUSTOMER_ID}}`.\n- When the customer lands on your site, create a customer portal session using\nthe customer ID from the previous step.\n-\n[Redirect](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management/integrate-customer-portal#redirect)\nthe customer to the customer portal, where they can update their subscription\nwith payment details.\n\nYour customers can also [resume their paused\nsubscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/trials#resume-a-paused-subscription)\nin the customer portal by selecting **Start subscription**, then adding a\npayment method. View [free trial\nperiods](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/trials#create-free-trials-without-payment)\nto learn how to configure a subscription to pause or cancel when a free trial\nends without a payment method attached.\n\n## Combining trials with usage-based billing\n\nYou can use trial periods for subscriptions with [usage-based\nbilling](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models#usage-based-pricing).\nDuring the trial period, any usage accrued doesn’t count toward the total\ncharged to the customer at the end of the billing cycle. After the trial period\nends, usage accrues and is billed at the end of the next billing cycle.\n\n### Trials and aggregate usage\n\nIf you use the `aggregate_usage`\n[parameter](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/create#create_price-recurring-aggregate_usage)\nand set the behavior to `last_ever`, your customer is billed for the last usage\nrecord if it falls within the trial period, even if the usage occurred during\nthe trial period.\n\nFor example, if you provide file storage you might want to offer a month of free\nstorage, but then charge for the first month if the customer continues to store\nfiles with your service.\n\n## Links\n\n-\n[subscription_data.trial_period_days](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-subscription_data-trial_period_days)\n-\n[subscription_data.trial_end](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-subscription_data-trial_end)\n- [https://example.com/success](https://example.com/success)\n- [https://example.com/cancel](https://example.com/cancel)\n-\n[payment_method_collection=if_required](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-payment_method_collection)\n-\n[trial_settings.end_behavior.missing_payment_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-subscription_data-trial_settings-end_behavior-missing_payment_method)\n- [payment\ncollection](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/pause-payment)\n- [Subscriptions and emails\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/automatic)\n- [set up free trial\nreminders](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/revenue-recovery/customer-emails#trial-ending-reminders)\n- [compliance requirements for trials and\npromotions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/trials#compliance)\n- [Billing customer portal](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management)\n-\n[event](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-customer.subscription.trial_will_end)\n- [default payment\nmethod](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-default_payment_method)\n- [Customers API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/retrieve)\n-\n[Redirect](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management/integrate-customer-portal#redirect)\n- [resume their paused\nsubscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/trials#resume-a-paused-subscription)\n- [free trial\nperiods](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/trials#create-free-trials-without-payment)\n- [usage-based\nbilling](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models#usage-based-pricing)\n-\n[parameter](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/create#create_price-recurring-aggregate_usage)",
