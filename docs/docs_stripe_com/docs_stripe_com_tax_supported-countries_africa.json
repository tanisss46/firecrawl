Click the\nfollowing links to learn about the thresholds in each country and the types of\ngoods and services we support.\n\n- [Angola](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/africa/angola)\n- [Democratic Republic of\nCongo](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/africa/democratic-republic-congo)\n- [Egypt](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/africa/egypt)\n- [Guinea](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/africa/guinea)\n- [Kenya](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/africa/kenya)\n-\n[Mauritania](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/africa/mauritania)\n- [Morocco](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/africa/morocco)\n- [Nigeria](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/africa/nigeria)\n- [Senegal](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/africa/senegal)\n- [South\nAfrica](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/africa/south-africa)\n- [Tanzania](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/africa/tanzania)\n- [Uganda](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/africa/uganda)\n- [Zambia](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/africa/zambia)\n- [Zimbabwe](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/africa/zimbabwe)\n\n## When and how to register for tax collection\n\nDifferent rules determine when and how you need to register to collect tax\ndepending on the country. Click the links above to learn about the thresholds\nfor tax collection in each location.\n\nSee [Thresholds](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/thresholds) to get insights\nabout your potential tax registration obligations in each location. Stripe only\nmonitors if you have reached a tax threshold for sales outside of the country\nyour business is based in. Stripe also notifies you with email and Dashboard\nalerts when you need to register to collect tax. Learn more about how the\n[monitoring tool works](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/monitoring).\n\nIn this region, your business needs to be a remote seller with no physical\npresence (such as a shop or warehouse) to collect tax on Stripe.\n\nAfter you’ve registered with a country, go to\n[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations) to add your\nregistrations to Stripe in the Dashboard to start collecting tax on your\ntransactions in that location.\n\n## How we calculate taxes\n\nStripe can calculate tax for [any of the product tax codes you assign to your\nproducts](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes) in South Africa. For all the\nother countries listed in this region, Stripe only supports calculation for\n[digital products](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes?type=digital) sold by\nremote sellers.\n\n### Domestic transactions\n\nA transaction where your business and your customer are in the same country is\ncalled a domestic transaction. Stripe doesn’t yet support calculation on\ndomestic transactions in this region.\n\n### Cross border transactions\n\nA cross-border transaction is where your customer is located in a different\ncountry to your business or when goods are shipped from one country to another.\n\nStripe calculates tax on a cross-border transaction taking into account the\nfollowing factors:\n\n- the location of your business\n- the tax registrations you’ve added to Stripe\n- the location of the buyer\n- the type of the product sold (based on which [product tax\ncode](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes) you assigned to your product)\n- the status of the customer (whether they’re an individual or a business)\n\n#### Digital products\n\nDigital products are non-physical items or services that are delivered, given,\nor rendered electronically. This includes digital goods and electronically\nsupplied services. We determine whether you’re selling digital products or\nphysical goods using the [product tax\ncode](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes) you assigned to your product.\n\nDigital products are generally taxable in the country where your customer is\nlocated. However sales of digital products to businesses in other countries\nmight have reverse charge applied. With reverse charge, your business provides\nan invoice for the purchase so that your customer can calculate the tax.\n\n#### Physical goods\n\nWhen physical goods are shipped to a customer in a different country to your\nbusiness, the transaction is referred to as an export. Stripe doesn’t yet\nsupport calculation on exports of physical goods in this region.\n\n## Report and file your taxes\n\nStripe provides reports of your completed tax transactions. Go to\n[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations) to access these\nreports. Learn more about [the different types of\nreports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports).\n\nYou’re responsible for filing and remitting your taxes. Stripe doesn’t file\ntaxes on your behalf.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Angola](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/africa/angola)\n- [Democratic Republic of\nCongo](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/africa/democratic-republic-congo)\n- [Egypt](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/africa/egypt)\n- [Guinea](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/africa/guinea)\n- [Kenya](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/africa/kenya)\n-\n[Mauritania](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/africa/mauritania)\n- [Morocco](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/africa/morocco)\n- [Nigeria](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/africa/nigeria)\n- [Senegal](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/africa/senegal)\n- [South\nAfrica](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/africa/south-africa)\n- [Tanzania](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/africa/tanzania)\n- [Uganda](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/africa/uganda)\n- [Zambia](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/africa/zambia)\n- [Zimbabwe](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/africa/zimbabwe)\n- [Thresholds](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/thresholds)\n- [monitoring tool works](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/monitoring)\n- [Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations)\n- [any of the product tax codes you assign to your\nproducts](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes)\n- [digital products](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes?type=digital)\n- [the different types of reports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports)",
