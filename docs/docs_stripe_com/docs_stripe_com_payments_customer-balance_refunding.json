  "content": "# Refund bank transfer payments\n\n## Refund payments made with bank transfers, or refund a customer’s available cash balance.\n\nYou can refund customer balance payments through the\n[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments) or\n[API](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_refund).\n\n## Refund a payment to the customer\n\nStripe requires customer bank account details to process the refund. In some\ncases, Stripe receives the customer’s bank account details when performing the\ntransfer. Stripe emails the customer to let them know that the refund is in\nprocess.\n\nWhen we can’t determine the destination bank account automatically due to\nunavailable or ambiguous customer bank account information, Stripe requests it\nby contacting the customer at the email address in the customer object you\ncreated. If you didn’t include an email address when you created the customer\nobject, creating a refund results in an error. Update the customer object with a\nvalid email address for the customer, and try creating the refund again. You can\nspecify a new email address when you create a refund.\n\nIn some cases, Stripe performs additional checks before processing a refund or\nasking your customers for bank account information. Stripe contacts you if we\nrequire more information before finalizing the refund.\n\nCustomers have 45 days from receipt of the request to submit bank account\ndetails. After 45 days without a valid response, Stripe cancels the refund and\nreturns the funds to the customer’s account cash balance. We recommend you then\ncontact your customer to discuss alternative ways of returning the funds.\n\nYou can refund a payment up to 180 days after it was created.\n\n### Creating a payment refund using the Dashboard\n\n- To refund a payment made with a bank transfer, navigate to the payment page\nand click **Refund**.\n\n!\n\n- In the following dialog, enter the amount you want to refund, if different\nthan the full payment amount, and any other details about the refund. Then click\n**Refund**.\n\n### Creating a payment refund using the API\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/refunds \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d payment_intent={{PAYMENT_INTENT_ID}} \\\n --data-urlencode instructions_email=\"customeremail@example.com\"\n```\n\nRefunds are sent to the customer’s bank account, and the customer receives a\nnotification at their default email address. If you want to override the default\nemail address used to contact the customer, specify the new email address using\nthe\n[instructions_email](https://docs.stripe.com/api/refunds/object#refund_object-instructions_email)\nparameter.\n\nThe refund’s status transitions as follows:\n\nEventRefund statusRefund is created`requires_action`Customer submits bank\naccount details, and Stripe begins processing the refund`pending`Refund is\nexpected to arrive in customer’s bank`succeeded`Customer’s bank returns the\nfunds back to Stripe`requires_action`Refund is in `requires_action` 45 days\nafter creation`failed`Refund is canceled from a `requires_action`\nstate`canceled`\nIf the customer’s bank can’t successfully complete the transfer, the funds are\nreturned to Stripe and the refund transitions to `requires_action`. This can\nhappen if the account holder’s name doesn’t match what the recipient bank has on\nfile or if the provided bank account number has a typo. In these cases, Stripe\nemails the customer to inform them of the failure and to request that they\nresubmit their bank account details.\n\nIf your customer doesn’t provide their bank account details within 45 days, the\nrefund’s status transitions to `failed` and we send the\n[refund.failed](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-refund.failed)\nevent. This means that Stripe can’t process the refund, and you must [return the\nfunds to your customer outside of\nStripe](https://docs.stripe.com/refunds#failed-refunds).\n\nThe\n[instructions_email](https://docs.stripe.com/api/refunds/object#refund_object-instructions_email)\nfield on the refund is the email that the refund was sent to. While a refund is\nwaiting for a response from the customer, details of the email sent to the\ncustomer can also be found under the\n[next_action.display_details.email_sent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/refunds/object#refund_object-next_action-display_details-email_sent)\nfield on the refund.\n\nEach individual refund (including each partial refund) may incur a fee. Please\nreach out to your point of contact at Stripe to learn more about this.\n\n## Cancel a payment refund sent to the customer\n\nIf a bank transfer payment refund has been sent to the customer, and the\ncustomer hasn’t submitted their bank details, you can still cancel the refund.\n\n### Canceling a payment refund using the Dashboard\n\n- To cancel a refund for a bank transfer payment, navigate to the payment page\nand click **Cancel refund**.\n\n!\n\n- If the payment has multiple partial refunds in the `requires_action` state,\nselect the correct refund from the **Refund** dropdown in the following dialog.\n- Confirm the cancellation by selecting **Cancel refund** in the dialog.\n\n### Canceling a payment refund using the API\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/refunds/{{REFUND_ID}}/cancel \\\n -u sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2: \\\n -X POST\n```\n\nAfter the payment refund has been canceled, the refund transitions from\n`requires_action` to `canceled`. If there are no other refunds, the payment\ntransitions back to its original pre-refund state.\n\n## Refund a payment to the customer’s cash balance\n\nA refund to the customer balance succeeds immediately. Refunds to the customer\nbalance are free of charge.\n\n### Creating a payment refund using the Dashboard\n\n- To refund a payment made with a bank transfer, navigate to the payment page\nand click **Refund**.\n\n!\n\n- In the following dialog, select **Customer balance** in the **Destination**\ndropdown. Selecting this option deposits the refund into the customer’s Stripe\naccount, which allows them to use the funds for future payments on your site.\n\n## Refund the cash balance to the customer\n\nYou can return a customer’s cash balance directly to them. For example, you\nmight need to do this when a customer transfers more funds than expected for a\npayment.\n\n### Refund a customer’s cash balance using the Dashboard\n\n- Navigate to the [Customer list](https://dashboard.stripe.com/customers) page.\n- Click the customer in the list of customers.\n- Expand the **Cash Balance** row in the **Payment methods** section.\n- Click **Initiate Refund** button at the end of the row.\n\n!\n\n- In the next dialog, enter the amount to refund.\n- Click **Initiate Refund**.\n\nView the status of the refund on the customer balance transactions list page.\n\n### Refund a customer’s cash balance using the API\n\nTo refund a customer’s cash balance with the API, set the\n[origin](https://docs.stripe.com/api/refunds/object#refund_object-origin)\nparameter to `customer_balance` and specify the\n[customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/refunds/object#refund_object-customer).\nThe customer’s default email address is used to contact them. To override it,\nspecify the new email address using the\n[instructions_email](https://docs.stripe.com/api/refunds/object#refund_object-instructions_email)\nparameter.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/refunds \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d amount=1099 \\\n -d currency=usd \\\n -d customer={{CUSTOMER_ID}} \\\n --data-urlencode instructions_email=\"jenny.rosen@example.com\" \\\n -d origin=customer_balance\n```\n\n## Cancel a cash balance refund sent to the customer\n\nYou can only cancel un-processed refunds. After the customer submits their bank\naccount details, you can’t cancel a refund. Currently, you must use the Stripe\nDashboard to cancel a refund:\n\n- Navigate to the [Customer list](https://dashboard.stripe.com/customers) page.\n- Click the customer in the list of customers.\n- Expand the **Cash Balance** row in the **Payment methods** section.\n- Click the **View balance details** link.\n\n!\n\n- Click the overflow menu (**•••**) next to the refund you want to cancel and\nclick the **Cancel** link\n\n!\n\nThe refund amount is credited back to the available cash balance.\n\n## Track state of a refund\n\nYou can track the state of a refund through the\n[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments) or\n[API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/refunds).\n\n### When and where refund email is sent\n\nStripe sends an email to the email address provided in the\n[instructions_email](https://docs.stripe.com/api/refunds/object#refund_object-instructions_email)\nfield on the refund. While a refund is waiting for a response from the customer,\nyou can also check the refund’s\n[next_action.display_details.email_sent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/refunds/object#refund_object-next_action-display_details-email_sent)\nfield for details such as the sent time and the address. The sent time is also\nthe time when the refund transitioned to the `requires_action` state.\n\n### Pending refunds\n\nIf the customer has submitted their bank account details, the refund transitions\nto `pending`.\n\n### Successful refunds\n\nThe refund transitions to `succeeded` when the refund is successfully paid out\nto the customer.\n\n## Test refunds\n\nYou can test refund behavior in a sandbox using the following test bank accounts\non the bank account details collection page linked in the email sent to the\ncustomer. Bank account details outside of these test bank accounts won’t be\naccepted.\n\n#### Note\n\nIn a sandbox, refund instruction emails are only sent to email addresses linked\nto the Stripe account.\n\nIBANJapanMexicoUnited KingdomUnited States\nSpecify the appropriate [country\ncode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Officially_assigned_code_elements)\n(for example, GB, IL, CR, and so on) to test IBANs for any IBAN country and any\nvalid currency for that country. For instance, the following IBANs specify\nGermany with the `DE` prefix.\n\nNumberType`DE89370400440532013000`Refund succeeds.\n`DE62370400440532013001`\n\n`DE89370400440532013002`\n\n`DE89370400440532013003`\n\n`DE89370400440532013004`\n\n`DE89370400440532013005`\n\nRefund fails.\n\n#### Testing Refunds Expiry\n\nYou can make an API call to simulate the expiry of a testmode refund.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/test_helpers/refunds/{{REFUND_ID}}/expire \\\n -X POST \\\n -u sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\n```\n\n## Links\n\n- [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments)\n- [API](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_refund)\n-\n[instructions_email](https://docs.stripe.com/api/refunds/object#refund_object-instructions_email)\n-\n[refund.failed](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-refund.failed)\n- [return the funds to your customer outside of\nStripe](https://docs.stripe.com/refunds#failed-refunds)\n-\n[next_action.display_details.email_sent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/refunds/object#refund_object-next_action-display_details-email_sent)\n- [Customer list](https://dashboard.stripe.com/customers)\n- [origin](https://docs.stripe.com/api/refunds/object#refund_object-origin)\n- [customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/refunds/object#refund_object-customer)\n- [API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/refunds)\n- [country\ncode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Officially_assigned_code_elements)",
