Bank\nNegara Malaysia (BNM), the Central Bank of Malaysia, and 11 other major\nMalaysian financial institutions are members of the PayNet Group, which owns and\noperates FPX. It’s one of the most popular online payment methods in Malaysia,\nwith nearly 90 million transactions in 2018 according to BNM.\n\nTo pay with FPX, customers are redirected to their online banking environment\nwhere they have to perform two-step authorization. The exact payment flow varies\ndepending on the customer’s bank. The FPX payment flow is well understood and\nintuitive to Malaysian customers.\n\nAs part of being regulatory compliant, Stripe requires merchants to provide\ntheir Business Registration Number (BRN) to process FPX charges and receive\npayouts.\n\nPayment method propertiesBusiness locationsProduct support- **Customer\nlocations**\n\nMalaysia\n- **Presentment currency**\n\nMYR\n- **Payment confirmation**\n\nCustomer-authenticated\n- **Payment method family**\n\nAuthenticated bank debit\n- **Recurring payments**\n\nNo\n- **Refunds / Partial refunds**\n\n[Yes / Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/fpx#refunds)\n- **Dispute support**\n\n[No](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/fpx#disputed-payments)\n- **Manual capture support**\n\nNo\n- **Connect support**\n\nYes\n- **Payout timing**\n\n5 business days\n\n## Payment flow\n\n[Watch a video](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/fpx#payment-flow-video)\n\n!\n\nCustomer selects FPX at checkout\n\n!\n\nChooses bank and gets redirected\n\n!\n\nCustomer enters account credentials\n\n!\n\nCustomer completes authorization process\n\n!\n\nCustomer gets notification that payment is complete\n\n!\n\n(Optional) Customer returns back to business’s site for payment confirmation\n\n## Get started\n\nYou don’t have to integrate FPX and other payment methods individually. If you\nuse our front-end products, Stripe automatically determines the most relevant\npayment methods to display. Go to the [Stripe\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and enable\nFPX. To get started with one of our hosted UIs, follow a quickstart:\n\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart): Our prebuilt, hosted\ncheckout page.\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart): Our drop-in UI\ncomponents.\n\n### Other payment products\n\nThe following Stripe products also let you add FPX from the Dashboard:\n\n- [Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/no-code-guide)\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n\nIf your integration requires manually listing payment methods, learn how to\n[manually configure FPX as a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/fpx/accept-a-payment).\n\nCheck out the FPX [sample on\nGitHub](https://github.com/stripe-samples/accept-a-payment).\n\n## Disputes\n\nThe risk of fraud or unrecognized payments is low because the customer must\nauthenticate the payment with their bank. As a result, you won’t have disputes\nthat turn into chargebacks, with funds withdrawn from your Stripe account.\n\n## Refunds\n\nFPX payments can be refunded up to 60 days after the original payment. Refunds\nfor FPX payments are asynchronous and take approximately 1 week to complete.\nWe’ll notify you of the final refund status using the `refund.updated` or\n`refund.failed` [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) event. When a refund\nsucceeds, the [Refund](https://docs.stripe.com/api/refunds/object) object’s\nstatus transitions to `succeeded`. A refund can fail if the customer’s bank is\nunable to process it correctly (for example, the bank account is closed). In the\nrare instance that a refund fails, the Refund object’s status transitions to\n`failed` and we return the amount to your Stripe balance. You then need to\narrange an alternative way of providing your customer with a refund.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Yes / Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/fpx#refunds)\n- [No](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/fpx#disputed-payments)\n- [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods)\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart)\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart)\n- [Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/no-code-guide)\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n- [manually configure FPX as a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/fpx/accept-a-payment)\n- [sample on GitHub](https://github.com/stripe-samples/accept-a-payment)\n- [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks)\n- [Refund](https://docs.stripe.com/api/refunds/object)",
