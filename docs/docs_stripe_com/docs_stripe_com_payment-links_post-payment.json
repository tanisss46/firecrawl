  "content": "# After a payment link payment\n\n## Learn what you can do after receiving a payment link payment.\n\nAfter you receive a payment through a payment link, you can track payments,\nmanage fulfillment automatically, view payment link metrics, and more.\n\n## Track payments\n\nAfter your customer makes a payment using a payment link, you can see it in the\npayments overview in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments). If\nyou’re new to Stripe, you receive an email after your first payment. To receive\nemails for all successful payments, update your notification preferences in your\n[profile settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/user).\n\nStripe creates a new [guest\ncustomer](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/guest-customers) for\none-time payments and a new [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers)\nwhen selling a subscription or [saving a payment method for future\nuse](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links/customize#save-payment-details-for-future-use).\n\n## Automatically handle fulfillment\n\nYou can automatically handle fulfillment through a Stripe partner or\nprogrammatically with the Stripe API:\n\n- **Automation with a Stripe partner:** To automate post-purchase activities\nlike order fulfillment, emailing customers, and recording data to a spreadsheet,\nyou can use a Stripe partner, like\n[Zapier](https://help.zapier.com/hc/articles/10821467221133), to connect Stripe\ndata to other applications.\n- **Handle fulfillment programmatically:** If you’re interested in handling\nfulfillment programmatically using the Stripe API and\n[webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks), learn how to [fulfill orders after\na customer pays](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/fulfillment).\n\n## Change confirmation behavior\n\nAfter a successful payment, your customer sees a localized confirmation message\nthanking them for their purchase. You can customize the confirmation message or\nredirect to a URL of your choice. To change the confirmation behavior on a\npayment link, click **After the payment** when\n[creating](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payment-links/create) or editing a\npayment link. Under **Confirmation page**, you can choose to replace the default\nmessage with a custom one.\n\nYou can also choose to redirect your customers to your website instead of\nproviding a confirmation page. If you redirect your customers to your own\nconfirmation page, you can include `{CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}` in the redirect URL\nto dynamically pass the customer’s current Checkout Session ID. This is helpful\nif you want to tailor the success message on your website based on the\ninformation in the Checkout Session. You can also add [UTM\ncodes](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links/url-parameters#track-campaigns-with-utm-codes)\nas parameters in the query string of the payment link URL. The UTM codes are\nautomatically added to your redirect URL when your customer completes a payment.\n\n## Split payment with a connected account\n\nWith Stripe Connect, you can split a payment with a connected account. When\n[creating a new payment\nlink](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payment-links/create), on the **After\npayment** tab, select the checkbox that says **Split the payment with a\nconnected account**. Selecting this checkbox allows a connected account to\nautomatically get paid when a customer buys the product through this payment\nlink. Learn how to [use payment links with connected\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/collect-then-transfer-guide?platform=no-code).\n\n## Let customers manage their subscriptions\n\nCreate a link that you can send to customers, letting them log in and manage\ntheir subscriptions using the [customer\nportal](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/customer-portal).\n\n## Send email receipts\n\nStripe can automatically send email receipts to your customers after successful\npayments. You can enable this feature with the [email customers for successful\npayments](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/emails) option in your email\nreceipt settings. To customize your receipt color and logo, go to the [Branding\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding).\n\nTo display custom text, use the\n[description](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-description)\nattribute on the\n[PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object). Some\nexamples include:\n\n- Description of goods or services provided\n- Authorization code\n- Subscription information\n- Cancellation policies\n\n### Automatically send paid invoices\n\nIn addition to ordinary receipts, Payment Links can generate paid invoices as\nproof of payment. Invoices have more information than receipts. For\nsubscriptions, Stripe generates invoices automatically, but for one-time\npayments, you need to enable them.\n\nTo generate invoices, toggle **Successful payments** on in your [Customer emails\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/emails). Then, when [creating a\nPayment Link](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payment-links/create), select\n**Create an invoice PDF** in the **After payment** tab. You can configure your\ninvoice, including adding a memo, footer, and your tax ID in your [invoice\ntemplate settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/invoice).\n\nAfter the payment completes, Stripe sends an invoice summary with links to\ndownload the invoice PDF and invoice receipt to the email address your customer\nprovides during checkout. You can also view the invoice in the\n[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/invoices) or access it programmatically\nby listening to the\n[invoice.paid](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-invoice.paid)\nevent through an [event\ndestination](https://docs.stripe.com/event-destinations).\n\n#### Caution\n\nInvoices for delayed notification payment methods such as [Bacs Direct\nDebit](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bacs-debit/accept-a-payment), [Bank\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bank-transfers/accept-a-payment),\n[Boleto](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/boleto/accept-a-payment), [Canadian\npre-authorized\ndebits](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/acss-debit/accept-a-payment),\n[Konbini](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/konbini/accept-a-payment),\n[OXXO](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/oxxo/accept-a-payment), [Pay by\nBank](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/pay-by-bank/accept-a-payment), [SEPA\nDirect Debit](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sepa-debit/accept-a-payment),\n[SOFORT](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sofort/accept-a-payment), or [ACH\nDirect\nDebit](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ach-direct-debit/accept-a-payment) might\ntake longer to send because we send the invoice after successful payment, not\nupon checkout session completion.\n\n![Screenshot of the invoice PDF that customers can download from the invoice\nsummary\nemail](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/invoice.9e44668032383601eeec362f38293b7a.png)\n\nThe downloadable invoice PDF\n\n![Screenshot of the invoice receipt that customers can download from the invoice\nsummary\nemail](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/invoice_receipt.4f120ee7363f8e7728fa553a8a24aae3.png)\n\nThe downloadable invoice receipt\n\n![Screenshot of the invoice summary email Stripe\nsends](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/email.560c2666905531b907f7fcd4f1a0a6dd.png)\n\nThe customer email with links to the invoice PDF and receipt\n\n### Localization\n\nWhen using Payment Links, the language of the receipt and invoice is determined\nby the browser locale of the user opening the Payment Link URL.\n\n## View payment link metrics\n\nYou can see metrics such as views, sales, and revenue from a given payment link\nby clicking the **Payments and analytics** tab after selecting a payment link\nfrom the [list view](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payment-links). Note that\nStripe can delay data for up to 18 hours, and isn’t available in a sandbox.\nAnalytics aren’t supported for links that include recurring prices.\n\nYou can use this data to better understand how your link is performing and what\nits conversion rate is:\n\n- **Views**: The number of times your payment link was opened.\n- **Sales**: The number of times the payment link was used to complete a\npurchase.\n- **Revenue**: The gross sales volume that the link generated and is always in\nyour default currency regardless of the presentment currency. Stripe converts\nthe amounts using the exchange rate on the day the payment occurs.\n\n## Refund payment links\n\nTo refund a payment using the Dashboard:\n\n- Find the payment you want to refund in the\n[Payments](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments) page.\n- Click the overflow menu () to the right of the payment, then select **Refund\npayment**.\n- By default, you issue a full refund. For a partial refund, enter a different\nrefund amount.\n- Select a reason for the refund. If you select **Other**, you must add a note\nthat explains the reason for the refund. Click **Refund**.\n\nAlternatively, you can click a specific payment and issue a refund from its\ndetails page. You can also send [refund\nreceipts](https://docs.stripe.com/receipts#refund-receipts) automatically or\nmanually send a receipt for each refund.\n\n### Bulk refunds\n\nThe Dashboard supports the bulk refunding of full payments. Select what payments\nyou want to refund by checking the box to the left of each payment—even over\nmultiple pages of results. Then, click **Refund** and select a reason. You can\nonly issue full refunds in this way; partial refunds must be issued\nindividually.\n\n### Refund timing\n\nIt typically takes 5-10 business days for the refund to be processed and\nreflected on the customer’s bank statement. If there are any issues with\ninsufficient funds in your Stripe balance, the refund might be set as pending\nuntil resolved.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments)\n- [profile settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/user)\n- [guest customer](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/guest-customers)\n- [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers)\n- [saving a payment method for future\nuse](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links/customize#save-payment-details-for-future-use)\n- [Zapier](https://help.zapier.com/hc/articles/10821467221133)\n- [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks)\n- [fulfill orders after a customer\npays](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/fulfillment)\n- [creating](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payment-links/create)\n- [UTM\ncodes](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links/url-parameters#track-campaigns-with-utm-codes)\n- [use payment links with connected\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/collect-then-transfer-guide?platform=no-code)\n- [customer\nportal](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/customer-portal)\n- [email customers for successful\npayments](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/emails)\n- [Branding settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding)\n-\n[description](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-description)\n- [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object)\n- [invoice template\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/invoice)\n- [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/invoices)\n-\n[invoice.paid](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-invoice.paid)\n- [event destination](https://docs.stripe.com/event-destinations)\n- [Bacs Direct\nDebit](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bacs-debit/accept-a-payment)\n- [Bank\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bank-transfers/accept-a-payment)\n- [Boleto](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/boleto/accept-a-payment)\n- [Canadian pre-authorized\ndebits](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/acss-debit/accept-a-payment)\n- [Konbini](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/konbini/accept-a-payment)\n- [OXXO](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/oxxo/accept-a-payment)\n- [Pay by Bank](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/pay-by-bank/accept-a-payment)\n- [SEPA Direct\nDebit](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sepa-debit/accept-a-payment)\n- [SOFORT](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sofort/accept-a-payment)\n- [ACH Direct\nDebit](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ach-direct-debit/accept-a-payment)\n- [list view](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payment-links)\n- [refund receipts](https://docs.stripe.com/receipts#refund-receipts)",
