If you currently handle any local payment methods using the Sources\nAPI, you must [migrate them to the Payment Methods\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/transitioning).\n\nWhile we don’t plan to remove support for card payments, we recommend replacing\nany use of the Sources API with the [PaymentMethods\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods), which provides access to our\nlatest features and payment method types.\n\n[Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect) platform owners can make use of\nadditional payment methods supported with Sources. To learn more about creating\npayments for connected users, and which approach is best for you, refer to our\nConnect [payments and fees\ndocumentation](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges).\n\n## Creating destination charges\n\nIf you opt for [destination\ncharges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges), you should create\nSources on your platform directly and create Charges using the appropriate\ndestination parameter. [Customers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers) are\ncharged by your platform, which then transfers the necessary amount to the\ndestination account.\n\nWith destination charges that use cards, your platform name appears on statement\ndescriptors and the charge is attributed to the connected account. With\ndestination charges that use alternative payment methods (APMs), your platform\nname appears on statement descriptors but the charge is attributed to your\nplatform.\n\n## Creating direct charges\n\nIf you opt for direct charges, you will need to make sure that the connected\naccount is onboarded on the payment method you intend to use (see below). Direct\ncharges require creating sources on connected accounts. You can do so by passing\n`source.stripeAccount` with a value of a connected account’s ID when using\nStripe.js.\n\n```\n// Set the connected Stripe Account on which the source should be created\nvar stripe = Stripe(\n 'pk_test_TYooMQauvdEDq54NiTphI7jx',\n {stripeAccount: \"{{CONNECTED_STRIPE_ACCOUNT_ID}}\"},\n);\n\nstripe.createSource({\n type: 'ideal',\n amount: 1099,\n currency: 'eur',\n owner: {\n name: 'Jenny Rosen',\n },\n redirect: {\n return_url: 'https://shop.example.com/crtA6B28E1',\n },\n}).then(function(result) {\n // handle result.error or result.source\n});\n```\n\nIf you’re creating sources server-side, you can make use of [authentication\nusing the Stripe-Account\nheader](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/authentication#stripe-account-header)\nwith any of our supported libraries.\n\n### Cloning card Sources\n\nCard Sources (because they’re not intrinsically tied to your platform as they do\nnot require any authentication\n[flow](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#flow-for-customer-action)) can be created\non your platform and then cloned to a connected account to create direct charges\nthere.\n\nOnce you created a card Source and attached it to a Customer (see [Sources and\nCustomers](https://docs.stripe.com/sources/customers) for more details on how\nthese two objects interact), you can clone that card Source on a connected\naccount using the connected account’s ID as the `Stripe-Account` header:\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/sources \\\n -u sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2: \\\n -d \"customer\"=\"cus_AFGbOSiITuJVDs\" \\\n -d \"original_source\"=\"src_19YP2AAHEMiOZZp1Di4rt1K6\" \\\n -d \"usage\"=\"reusable\" \\\n -H \"Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTED_STRIPE_ACCOUNT_ID}}\"\n```\n\nCard Sources are generally `reusable`. However, when cloning them, you can\noverride the usage to constrain how the connected account uses them. You do so\nby specifying the `usage` as `single_use` when cloning the Source.\n\nIf you are creating reusable card Sources on your connected account, you should\nmake sure to attach them to Customers before charging them. Please refer to\n[Sources and Customers](https://docs.stripe.com/sources/customers) for more\ndetails on how to attach and manage Sources on Customers.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Supported Payment Methods](https://docs.stripe.com/sources)\n- [Sources API reference](https://docs.stripe.com/api#sources)\n- [Best Practices Using Sources](https://docs.stripe.com/sources/best-practices)\n\n## Links\n\n- [migrate them to the Payment Methods\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/transitioning)\n- [PaymentMethods API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods)\n- [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)\n- [payments and fees documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges)\n- [destination charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges)\n- [Customers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers)\n- [authentication using the Stripe-Account\nheader](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/authentication#stripe-account-header)\n- [flow](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#flow-for-customer-action)\n- [Sources and Customers](https://docs.stripe.com/sources/customers)\n- [Supported Payment Methods](https://docs.stripe.com/sources)\n- [Sources API reference](https://docs.stripe.com/api#sources)\n- [Best Practices Using Sources](https://docs.stripe.com/sources/best-practices)",
