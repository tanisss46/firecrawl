We help you understand which state or country\nyou might have such obligations in, even if your business doesn’t have a\nphysical presence there.\n\nWe group your registration obligations into the following categories:\n\n- Exceeded: Your estimated sales or transactions exceed the location’s\nregistration threshold, and your business likely needs to register for tax. You\ncan [use Stripe to\nregister](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/use-stripe-to-register).\n- Upcoming: Your estimated sales or transactions exceed 85% of the location’s\nthreshold. We expect you to exceed the threshold soon.\n- Monitoring: We’re actively monitoring your obligations for the location and\nwill let you know when you’re approaching its threshold.\n- Not monitoring: We aren’t monitoring your obligations in the location. This is\nbecause either:- Your [preset product tax\ncode](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/products-prices-tax-codes-tax-behavior#product-tax-code)\nis non-taxable in the location.\n- We only support monitoring [digital\nproducts](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes?type=digital) there, and your\n[preset product tax\ncode](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/products-prices-tax-codes-tax-behavior#product-tax-code)\nis non-digital. For more details, see the [countries supported by Stripe\nTax](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries).\n- Undetermined: For [marketplace\nfacilitators](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-for-marketplaces), we support\nmonitoring only in the UK, US, and EU. In the UK and EU, we support monitoring\nonly for [digital products](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes?type=digital).\n\nWhen Stripe Tax can’t determine the location for a transaction, we group its\ninformation into an **Unattributed revenue** category. Where possible, we\nseparate US unattributed revenue from global unattributed revenue.\n\nFor more information, see [Monitor your\nobligations](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/monitoring).\n\n## Registrations\n\nUse the **Registrations** tab to manage locations and access reports where you\nhave a tax registration. Registrations enable you to calculate and collect tax\nwith Stripe. Locations are either **Active**, **Scheduled**, or **Expired**.\n\nCategoryDefinitionActiveA registration that is currently calculating and\ncollecting tax.ScheduledA registration that will start calculating tax based on\nyour inputted start date (provided by the local tax authority).ExpiredA\nregistration that’s no longer calculating tax as it has passed the inputted end\ndate (provided by the local tax authority)\n### Add a registration\n\nTo start calculating and collecting tax for a location, you must add a\nregistration in Stripe Tax. You need to identify each state, province, and\ncountry where you have tax obligations. You need to register with the local tax\nauthority to collect tax for each tax obligation. Registration requirements vary\nby each location (often referred to as nexus in the US). If you have not already\nregistered, you can use [Stripe to\nregister](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/use-stripe-to-register) on your behalf.\n\nTo add a registration in the Dashboard:\n\n- Click **+Add registration** and select the country and the applicable state or\nprovince.\n- Add the date to start tax collection as provided by your local tax authority.\n- Save your changes.\n\n### Edit a registration\n\nTo maintain your compliance, you might need to edit your registration. Your\nlocal tax authority will inform you of any updates to your information or dates.\n\nTo edit a registration:\n\n- Click the overflow menu () next to the applicable registration.\n- Click **Edit registration**.\n- Save your changes.\n\n### End a registration\n\nTo stop calculating and collecting tax for a location, you must end the tax\nobligation’s registration.\n\nTo end a registration:\n\n- Click the overflow menu () next to the applicable registration.\n- Add the date (provided by your local tax authority) to stop tax collection.\n- Save your changes.\n\n### Export transactions\n\nYou can export your transaction data into either an itemized or summarized\nreport at the line item, imposition, and jurisdiction level for all locations\nwhere you have Stripe Tax is enabled.\n\nTo export transaction data:\n\n- Click **Export transactions**.\n- Select either **Itemized export** or **Summarized export** as needed.\n- Click **Download**.\n\nAfter you download the report, click **View Report**.\n\n### US location reports\n\nUS location reports aggregate your transaction data in the chosen location for a\nspecific filing period based on the state filing requirements. You can create\nthem for any US location where you have Stripe Tax enabled.\n\n### See also\n\n- [Set up Stripe Tax](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/set-up)\n- [Monitor your tax obligations](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/monitoring)\n- [Understand when you need to collect tax in each\nlocation](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries)\n- [Use Stripe to register](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/use-stripe-to-register)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Tax Settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/tax)\n- [use Stripe to register](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/use-stripe-to-register)\n- [preset product tax\ncode](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/products-prices-tax-codes-tax-behavior#product-tax-code)\n- [digital products](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes?type=digital)\n- [countries supported by Stripe\nTax](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries)\n- [marketplace facilitators](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-for-marketplaces)\n- [Monitor your obligations](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/monitoring)\n- [Set up Stripe Tax](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/set-up)",
