  "content": "# Carbon removal inventory\n\n## Learn about available carbon removal inventory.\n\n## Available products\n\n[Products](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product) represent the carbon\nremoval inventory available for purchase. All products come from offtake\nagreements with carbon removal suppliers in [Frontier’s\nportfolio](https://frontierclimate.com/portfolio?track=offtake).\n\n### Buy the portfolio\n\nAvoiding the worst impacts of climate change requires a portfolio of\ntechnologies. By purchasing the Frontier offtake portfolio, you accelerate the\ndevelopment of a range of carbon removal technologies while simultaneously\nmaximizing the likelihood that your tons are delivered by the expected delivery\nyear.\n\nFrontier conducts diligence on carbon removal technologies to grow this\nportfolio as the industry evolves.\n\nA 3% fee is charged when buying the portfolio.\n\nProductIDExpected delivery yearPrice per metric tonMinimum orderFrontier's 2027\nofftake portfolio`climsku_frontier_offtake_portfolio_2027`2027550 USD1\nkilogramFrontier's 2028 offtake\nportfolio`climsku_frontier_offtake_portfolio_2028`2028450 USD1 kilogram\nTo provide users with price certainty, we take on the underlying pricing risk.\nIf the actual price per ton delivered is less than price per ton sold, we’ll use\nall excess funds to buy more carbon removal. If the actual price per ton\ndelivered is greater than the price per ton sold—for example, if only the more\nexpensive suppliers can deliver—the price doesn’t change for you and the losses\nare borne by us.\n\nWe aim to fulfill orders from a diverse set of suppliers within Frontier’s\nofftake portfolio. However, we won’t fractionalize deliveries in quantities less\nthan 1 ton (for example, an order for 4 tons might include deliveries from up to\n4 suppliers).\n\n### Buy from individual suppliers\n\nIf you’re excited about a particular technology or want to align purchases with\ncompany-specific attributes (for example, geography), you can also purchase from\nindividual suppliers.\n\nA 5% fee is charged when ordering from these suppliers.\n\nProductIDPathwayLocationExpected delivery yearPrice per metric tonMinimum\norderCREW 2026`climsku_crew_2026`Enhanced weatheringNew Haven, CT, US2026565\nUSD1 tonCarbonCapture Inc. 2027`climsku_carbon_capture_inc_2027`Direct air\ncaptureLos Angeles, CA, US2027510 USD1 tonCarbonRun\n2027`climsku_carbon_run_2027`Ocean alkalinity enhancementHalifax, Nova Scotia,\nCA2027475 USD1 tonCharm Industrial 2026`climsku_charm_industrial_2026`Biomass\ncarbon removal and storageSan Francisco, CA, US2026630 USD1 kilogramCharm\nIndustrial 2027`climsku_charm_industrial_2027`Biomass carbon removal and\nstorageSan Francisco, CA, US2027575 USD1 kilogramCharm Industrial\n2028`climsku_charm_industrial_2028`Biomass carbon removal and storageSan\nFrancisco, CA, US2028550 USD1 kilogramHeirloom 2027`climsku_heirloom_2027`Direct\nair captureBrisbane, CA, US2027990 USD1 tonLithos\n2025`climsku_lithos_2025`Enhanced weatheringSan Francisco, CA, US2025390 USD1\ntonPhlair 2029`climsku_phlair_2029`Direct air captureMunich, Germany2029625 USD1\ntonTerradot 2027`climsku_terradot_2027`Enhanced weatheringSão Paulo,\nBrazil2027305 USD1 tonVaulted Deep 2026`climsku_vaulted_2026`Biomass carbon\nremoval and storageHouston, TX, US2026424 USD1 kilogram\n## Pricing\n\nOur goal is to bring new buyers into the market, not to make money. We price the\nproducts as close to cost as possible.\n\nFees help cover our underlying costs of administering the carbon removal\nportfolio. Frontier receives these fees for services including, but not limited\nto, sourcing, performing diligence, negotiating offtake agreements with,\nmonitoring the progress of, and reallocating demand between carbon removal\nsuppliers.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Products](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product)\n- [Frontier’s portfolio](https://frontierclimate.com/portfolio?track=offtake)",
