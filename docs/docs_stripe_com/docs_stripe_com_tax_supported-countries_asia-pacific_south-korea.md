# Collect tax in South Korea

## Learn how to use Stripe Tax to calculate, collect, and report tax in South Korea.

In South Korea, Stripe only supports collecting
[VAT](https://www.nts.go.kr/english/na/ntt/selectNttList.do?mi=11210&bbsId=30699)
for digital services. In Stripe, these are referred to as “digital products.” To
collect this tax on Stripe, you must be a remote seller without a physical
presence in the country.

## When to register for tax collection

See [Thresholds](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/thresholds) to get insights
about your potential tax registration obligations in South Korea. Stripe also
notifies you with email and Dashboard alerts when you need to register to
collect tax. Learn more about how the [monitoring tool
works](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/monitoring).

Remote sellers providing digital goods or electronically supplied services
(digital products) to consumers in South Korea must register for VAT purposes as
from the first sale. There are no registration thresholds for non-resident
service providers. Sales to business customers in South Korea do not trigger any
tax registration obligations as remote sellers are not required to collect tax
on such sales.

- **Threshold**: 1 transaction
- **Included transactions**: Business-to-consumer (B2C) sales of digital goods
and services

## How we calculate taxes

We only support calculations for [digital
products](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes?type=digital) (non-physical
items or services that are delivered, given, or rendered electronically) in
South Korea. Stripe doesn’t calculate tax for products that don’t use a digital
product tax code.

View the list of supported [digital product tax
codes](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes?type=digital). To calculate taxes
in South Korea, make sure that you [assign a tax
code](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/products-prices-tax-codes-tax-behavior#tax-code-on-product)
to each of your products.

## Report and file your taxes

Stripe provides reports of your completed tax transactions. Go to
[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations) to access these
reports. Learn more about [the different types of
reports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports).

You’re responsible for filing and remitting your taxes to South Korea. Stripe
doesn’t file taxes on your behalf.
