Because the invoice finalizes and is paid\nimmediately, you have no exposure to fluctuating exchange rates and therefore no\nforeign exchange (FX) gains or losses.\n\nAccountJanRevenue+36.00Cash+36.00\n## FX loss\n\nThis example uses the following assumptions:\n\n- On January 1, at 00:00:00 UTC, an invoice finalizes for 30 EUR.\n- On February 1, at 00:00:00 UTC, the customer pays the invoice for 30 EUR.\n- Your account’s settlement currency is USD.\n- The EUR to USD exchange rate is 1.20 at the time of finalization.\n- The EUR to USD exchange rate is 1.10 at the time of payment.\n\nIn this example, the exchange rate changed between invoice finalization and\npayment, so you receive 33 USD instead of 36.\n\nAccountJanFebAccountsReceivable+36.00-36.00Revenue+36.00Cash+33.00FxLoss+3.00\n## FX loss from a refund or dispute\n\nThis example uses the following assumptions:\n\n- On January 1, at 00:00:00 UTC, an invoice finalizes for 30 EUR.\n- On February 1, at 00:00:00 UTC, the customer pays the invoice for 30 EUR.\n- On March 1, at 00:00:00 UTC, a refund is issued for 30 EUR.\n- Your account’s settlement currency is USD.\n- The EUR to USD exchange rate is 1.20 at the time of finalization.\n- The EUR to USD exchange rate is 1.20 at the time of payment.\n- The EUR to USD exchange rate is 1.30 at the time of refund.\n\nIn this example, the exchange rate changed between invoice payment and refund,\nso you receive 36 USD but you later refund 39 USD. Therefore, you incur 3 USD\nfor FxLoss.\n\nAccountJanFebMarAccountsReceivable+36.00-36.00Revenue+36.00Refunds+36.00Cash+36.00-39.00FxLoss+3.00\nA dispute works in the same way as a refund, except that it books the disputes\naccount instead of the refunds account.\n\n## Multiple settlement currencies\n\nThis example uses the following assumptions:\n\n- Your account settles in USD by default but EUR is also a supported settlement\ncurrency.\n- On January 1, at 00:00:00 UTC, two invoices finalize for separate customers.\nOne is for 30 EUR, and the other is for 400 NOK.\n- The NOK to USD conversion rate is 0.10 at the time of finalization and\npayment.\n- Both invoices are paid immediately.\n\nIn this example, you receive 40 USD from the NOK transaction and 30 EUR from the\nEUR transaction. Because EUR is a supported settlement currency, no exchange\nrate is applied.\n\nAccountCurrencyJanRevenueUSD+40.00RevenueEUR+30.00CashUSD+40.00CashEUR+30.00",
