# Integrate Stripe Billing with Salesforce

## Use Stripe with your Salesforce workflows and processes.

Use the guidance on this page to learn how integrating Stripe with Salesforce

Combine Stripe Billing and Salesforce for the following benefits:

activity (for example, when your sales team activates an order).
- Model complex sales contracts using features in Stripe Billing, such as
subscription schedules, tiered prices, and usage-based (metered) billing.
- Generate links from within Salesforce to secure Stripe-hosted pages that allow
your customers to save a payment method on file.
- View the latest state of subscriptions and invoices of a customer from within
Salesforce.
