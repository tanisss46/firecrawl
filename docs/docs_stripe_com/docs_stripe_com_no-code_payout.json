This guide uses an example of a Q&A product that pays its writers a\nportion of the advertising revenue that their answers generate. The platform and\nconnected accounts are both in the US.\n\nWhen adding funds to your balance, best practice is to use a manual\n[payout](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts) schedule. If you enable automatic\npayouts, you can’t control whether the system uses added funds for payouts. You\ncan configure your schedule in your [payout\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payouts).\n\n#### Note\n\nOnly [team members](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/teams) with\nadministrator access to the platform Stripe account and [two-factor\nauthentication](https://support.stripe.com/questions/how-do-i-enable-two-step-verification)\nenabled can add funds.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- [Register your platform](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/set-up).\n- Add business details to [activate your\naccount](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/onboarding).\n- [Complete your platform\nprofile](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/settings/profile).\n- [Customize your brand\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/stripe-dashboard/branding).\nAdd a business name, icon, and brand color.\n[Create a connected\naccount](https://docs.stripe.com/no-code/payout#create-connected-account)\nWhen a user (seller or service provider) signs up on your platform, create a\nuser [Account](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts) (referred to as a\n*connected account*) so you can accept payments and move funds to their bank\naccount. Connected accounts represent your users in Stripe’s API and facilitate\nthe collection of information requirements so Stripe can verify the user’s\nidentity. For a Q&A product that pays for answers, the connected account\nrepresents the writer.\n\n#### Note\n\nThis guide uses Express accounts which have certain\n[restrictions](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/express-accounts#prerequisites-for-using-express).\nYou can evaluate [Custom\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom-accounts) as an alternative.\n\n### Customize your signup form\n\nIn your [platform\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/stripe-dashboard/branding),\ncustomize your Express signup form by changing the color and logos that users\nsee when they click your [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect) link.\n\nDefault Express signup form\n\nBranding settings\n\n### Create a connected account link\n\nYou can create a connected account onboarding link by clicking **+Create** on\nthe [accounts overview\npage](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/accounts/overview), and selecting\n**Express** for the account type, along with the **transfers** capability. Click\n**Continue** to generate a link to share with the user you want to onboard.\n\n![Create an account in the\nDashboard](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/create-account-unified.450b8fb21ed13bcc165baa7db225e157.png)\n\nCreate a connected account\n\nCreate an onboarding link\n\nThis link directs users to a form where they can provide information in order to\nconnect to your platform. For example, if you have a Q&A platform, you can\nprovide a link for writers to connect with the platform. The link is only for\nthe single connected account you created. After your user completes the\nonboarding flow, you can view them in your accounts list.\n\n!\n\n[Add funds to your\nbalance](https://docs.stripe.com/no-code/payout#add-funds-to-your-balance)\nTo add funds, go to the\n[Balance](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/balance/overview) section in the\nDashboard. Click **Add to balance** and select why you are adding funds to your\naccount.\n\nSelect **Pay out connected accounts** to add funds to pay out to your connected\naccounts. If you are adding funds to your balance to cover future refunds and\ndisputes, or to repay your platform’s negative balance, select **Cover negative\nbalances** and see [adding funds to your Stripe\nbalance](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/add-funds).\n\n### Verify your bank account\n\nGo through the verification process in the Dashboard when you first attempt to\nadd funds from an unverified bank account. If your bank account is unverified,\nyou’ll need to confirm two microdeposits from Stripe. These deposits appear in\nyour online banking statement within 1-2 business days. You’ll see `ACCTVERIFY`\nas the statement description.\n\nStripe notifies you in the Dashboard and through email when the microdeposits\nhave arrived in your account. To complete the verification process, click the\nDashboard notification in the\n[Balance](https://dashboard.stripe.com/balance/overview) section, enter the two\nmicrodeposit amounts, and click **Verify account**.\n\n### Add funds\n\nOnce verified, use the\n[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/balance/overview) to add funds to\nyour account balance.\n\n- In the Dashboard, go to the\n[Balance](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/balance/overview) section.\n- In the **Add to balance** window, enter an amount in USD and select Connect\npayouts.\n- In the resulting modal (shown below), enter an amount in USD.\n- Verify the amount and then click **Add funds.**\n- The resulting object is called a\n[top-up](https://docs.stripe.com/api/topups/object) and can be viewed in the\n[Top-ups](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/topups) section of the Dashboard.\n\n### View funds\n\nView your funds in the Dashboard on\n[Top-ups](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/topups) tab under the\n[Balance](https://dashboard.stripe.com/balance/overview) page. Each time you add\nfunds, a top-up object is made that has a unique ID in the format **tu_XXXXXX**,\nwhich you can see on the detailed view for the top-up.\n\n### Settlement timing\n\nUS platforms add funds via ACH debit and can take 5-6 business days to become\navailable in your Stripe balance. You can request a review of your account for\nfaster settlement timing by contacting [Stripe\nSupport](https://support.stripe.com/contact).\n\nAs we learn more about your account, Stripe might be able to decrease your\nsettlement timing automatically.\n\nAdding funds for future refunds and disputes or to repay a negative balance can\nhappen through [bank or wire\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/add-funds) and are\navailable in 1-2 business days.\n\n[Pay out to your user](https://docs.stripe.com/no-code/payout#pay-out-to-user)\nAfter your user completes [the onboarding\nprocess](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/add-and-pay-out-guide#create-connected-account)\nand you’ve added funds to your balance, you can transfer some of your balance to\nyour connected accounts. In this example, money is transferred from the Q&A\nplatform’s balance to the individual writer.\n\nTo pay your user, go to the **Balance** section of an account’s detail page and\nclick **Add funds**. By default, any funds you transfer to a connected account\naccumulate in the connected account’s Stripe balance and are paid out on a daily\nrolling basis. You can change the payout frequency by clicking the right-most\nbutton in the **Balance** section and selecting **Edit payout schedule**.\n\nSend funds to user\n\nEdit payout schedule\n\n## See also\n\n- [Managing connected accounts in the\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)\n- [Connect pricing](https://stripe.com/connect/pricing)\n- [payout](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts)\n- [payout settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payouts)\n- [team members](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/teams)\n- [two-factor\nauthentication](https://support.stripe.com/questions/how-do-i-enable-two-step-verification)\n- [Register your platform](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/set-up)\n- [activate your account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/onboarding)\n- [Complete your platform\nprofile](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/settings/profile)\n- [Customize your brand\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/stripe-dashboard/branding)\n- [Account](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts)\n-\n[restrictions](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/express-accounts#prerequisites-for-using-express)\n- [Custom accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom-accounts)\n- [accounts overview\npage](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/accounts/overview)\n- [Balance](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/balance/overview)\n- [adding funds to your Stripe\nbalance](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/add-funds)\n- [Balance](https://dashboard.stripe.com/balance/overview)\n- [top-up](https://docs.stripe.com/api/topups/object)\n- [Top-ups](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/topups)\n- [Stripe Support](https://support.stripe.com/contact)\n- [the onboarding\nprocess](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/add-and-pay-out-guide#create-connected-account)\n- [Managing connected accounts in the\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard)",
