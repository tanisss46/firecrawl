Switching between them\nis mostly a matter of swapping your [API keys](https://docs.stripe.com/keys).\n\nIf you are a developer, or had a developer perform an integration for you, you\nshould also consider the following items before going live. If you’re using\nStripe through a connected website or a plug-in, most won’t apply.\n\n- Set the API version\n#### Warning\n\nAll requests use your account API settings, unless you override the API version.\nThe [changelog](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#api-versions) lists every\navailable version. Note that by default webhook events are structured according\nto your account API version, unless you set an API version during [endpoint\ncreation](https://docs.stripe.com/api/webhook_endpoints/create).\n\nIf you’re using a strongly typed language (Go, Java, TypeScript, .NET), the\nserver-side library pins the API version based on the library version being\nused. If you’re not familiar with how Stripe manages versioning, please see the\n[versioning docs](https://docs.stripe.com/sdks#server-side-libraries).\n\nTo make sure everything is in sync:\n\n- Upgrade to the latest API version in\n[Workbench](https://dashboard.stripe.com/workbench) within the Dashboard\n- For dynamic languages (Node.js, PHP, Python, Ruby): [set the API\nversion](https://docs.stripe.com/sdks#server-side-libraries) in the server-side\nlibrary\n- For strongly typed languages (Go, Java, TypeScript, .NET): [upgrade to the\nlatest version](https://docs.stripe.com/sdks#server-side-libraries) of your\nchosen library\n- Handle edge cases\nWe’ve created several [test values](https://docs.stripe.com/testing) you can use\nto replicate various states and responses. Beyond these options, perform your\ndue diligence, testing your integration with:\n\n- Incomplete data\n- Invalid data\n- Duplicate data (for example, retry the same request to see what happens) We\nalso recommend you have someone else test your integration, especially if that\nother person isn’t a developer themselves.\n- Review your API error handling\nOnce you’ve gone live is an unfortunate time to discover you’ve not properly\nwritten your code to handle every possible [error\ntype](https://docs.stripe.com/api#errors), including those that should “never”\nhappen. Be certain your code is defensive, handling not just the common errors,\nbut all possibilities.\n\nWhen testing your error handling, pay close attention to what information is\nshown to your users. A card being declined (that is, a `card_error`) is a\ndifferent concern than an error on your backend (for example, an\n`invalid_request_error`).\n- Review your logging\nStripe logs every request made with your API keys, with these records being\nviewable in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/logs). We recommend\nthat you log all important data on your end, too, despite the apparent\nredundancy. Your own logs will be a life-saver if your server has a problem\ncontacting Stripe or there’s an issue with your API keys—both cases would\nprevent us from logging your request.\n\nRegularly examine your logs to ensure they’re storing only the information you\nneed and not anything of a sensitive nature (for example, credit card details or\npersonally identifiable information).\n- Ensure you're not relying on test objects\nStripe objects created in a sandbox environment—such as plans, coupons,\nproducts, and SKUs—are not usable in live mode. This prevents your test data\nfrom being inadvertently used in your production code. When recreating necessary\nobjects in live mode, be certain to use the same ID values (for example, the\nsame plan *ID*, not the same *name*) to guarantee your code continues to work\nwithout issue.\n- Ensure you've registered your production webhooks\nYour Stripe account can have both test and live [webhook\nendpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks). If you’re using webhooks, make\nsure you’ve defined live endpoints in your Stripe account. Then confirm that the\nlive endpoint functions exactly the same as your test endpoint.\n\nWhile examining your webhooks status, also take a moment to check that your\nproduction endpoint:\n\n- Gracefully handles delayed webhook notifications\n- Gracefully handles duplicate webhook notifications\n- Does not require event notifications to occur in a specific order\n- Subscribe to the API announcements mailing list\nWe recommend all developers subscribe to our [API updates mailing\nlist](https://groups.google.com/a/lists.stripe.com/forum/#!forum/api-announce)\nto keep up with new features as we release them.\n- Change and secure your API keys\nAs a security measure, we recommend [rolling your API\nkeys](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#safe-keys) on a regular basis, and also just\nbefore going live. This is in case they have been saved somewhere outside of\nyour codebase during development. Make sure your workflow doesn’t result in your\nAPI keys being represented or stored in multiple places—this leads to bugs—or\neven ending up in your version control software.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Become a Stripe Partner](https://stripe.com/partners/become-a-partner)\n- [log in](https://dashboard.stripe.com/)\n- [sandbox](https://docs.stripe.com/sandboxes)\n- [similarly as possible](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes)\n- [API keys](https://docs.stripe.com/keys)\n- [changelog](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#api-versions)\n- [endpoint creation](https://docs.stripe.com/api/webhook_endpoints/create)\n- [versioning docs](https://docs.stripe.com/sdks#server-side-libraries)\n- [Workbench](https://dashboard.stripe.com/workbench)\n- [test values](https://docs.stripe.com/testing)\n- [error type](https://docs.stripe.com/api#errors)\n- [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/logs)\n- [webhook endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks)\n- [API updates mailing\nlist](https://groups.google.com/a/lists.stripe.com/forum/#!forum/api-announce)\n- [rolling your API keys](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#safe-keys)",
