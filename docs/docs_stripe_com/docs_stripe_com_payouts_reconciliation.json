  "content": "# Payout reconciliation\n\n## Know which transactions are included in a given payout.\n\nSending funds from your Stripe available balance to your bank account generates\na payout object. Automatic payouts occur routinely according to your [payout\nschedule](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts#payout-schedule) and can include funds\nfrom multiple transactions.\n\nStripe provides the following ways to review the transactions included in an\nautomatic payout:\n\n- Open a payout in the [Stripe\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payouts).\n- View or download the [payout reconciliation\nreport](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/payout-reconciliation).\n- Retrieve the payout details through the Stripe API as documented in this\nguide.\n\n#### Reconciliation for manual payouts\n\nYou control the timing and amount of manual payouts, so Stripe can’t identify\nwhich transactions are included in each payout. You’re responsible for\nreconciling payouts you create against your transaction history.\n\n[Find the Payout ID](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts/reconciliation#payout-id)\nYou need a payout’s `id` (`po_xxx`) to retrieve information about the payout’s\ntransactions. To get it:\n\n- Listen to the `payout.reconciliation_completed` webhook event.\n- Call [List Payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payouts/list) to review a list\nof payouts.\n- Retrieve it from your own database.\n\nYou could [retrieve the Payout](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payouts/retrieve) to\naccess its properties, but this won’t include the individual transactions that\nmake up the total amount.\n\n```\n{\n \"id\": \"po_001\",\n \"amount\": 8000,\n \"currency\": \"usd\",\n \"status\": \"paid\",\n ...\n}\n```\n\n[List\nBalanceTransactions](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts/reconciliation#list-balancetransactions)\nEvery funds movement in or out of your Stripe account creates a\n[BalanceTransaction](https://docs.stripe.com/api/balance_transactions). Pass the\npayout ID in your [list\nBalanceTransaction](https://docs.stripe.com/api/balance_transactions/list)\nrequest to filter the results by only transactions associated with that payout.\n\n```\ncurl -G https://api.stripe.com/v1/balance_transactions \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d payout=po_xxx\n```\n\nIf you need more results than the default 10, set the\n[limit](https://docs.stripe.com/api/balance_transactions/list#balance_transaction_list-limit)\nparameter in the request or use Stripe’s\n[auto-pagination](https://docs.stripe.com/api/pagination/auto).\n\nThe response returns an array of BalanceTransactions objects for the specified\npayout:\n\n```\n{\n \"object\": \"list\",\n \"data\": [\n {\n \"id\": \"txn_001\",\n \"amount\": 10000,\n \"type\": \"charge\",\n \"source\": \"ch_001\",\n ...\n },\n {\n \"id\": \"txn_002\",\n \"amount\": -2000,\n \"type\": \"refund\",\n \"source\": \"re_001\",\n ...\n },\n ...\n```\n\nThe `type` property identifies the underlying activity that generated the\ntransaction. for example:\n\n- `charge`: A payment from your customer.\n- `refund`: Funds you returned to your customer.\n- `stripe_fee`: A Stripe fee you paid.\n- `payout`: The payout itself, which is also a transaction that moved funds from\nyour Stripe account to your bank account.\n\nSee [balance transaction\ntypes](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/balance-transaction-types#types) for a\ncomplete list.\n\n[Expand balance transaction\nresources](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts/reconciliation#expand-resources)\nThe `source` property of each BalanceTransaction identifies the underlying\nobject representing the transaction type, such as `ch_xxx` for a Charge or\n`re_xxx` for a Refund. To retrieve these objects without making extra API calls,\nupdate the previous code using [expand](https://docs.stripe.com/expand).\n\n```\ncurl -G https://api.stripe.com/v1/balance_transactions \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d payout=po_xxx \\\n -d \"expand[]\"=\"data.source\"\n```\n\nThe response contains the expanded `source` object for each BalanceTransaction\nin the payout:\n\n```\n{\n \"object\": \"list\",\n \"data\": [\n {\n \"id\": \"txn_001\",\n \"amount\": 10000,\n \"type\": \"charge\",\n \"source\": {\n \"id\": \"ch_001\",\n \"amount\": 10000,\n \"metadata\": { ... },\n ...\n },\n ...\n },\n {\n \"id\": \"txn_002\",\n \"amount\": -2000,\n \"type\": \"refund\",\n \"source\": {\n \"id\": \"re_001\",\n \"amount\": 2000,\n \"reason\": \"requested_by_customer\",\n ...\n },\n ...\n```\n\nUse the following code to access the `source` object properties such as `id` and\n`amount`.\n\n```\nbalance_transactions['data'].each do |txn|\n obj = txn['source']\n puts \"#{obj['id']} #{obj['amount']}\"\nend\n```\n\n## Links\n\n- [payout schedule](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts#payout-schedule)\n- [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payouts)\n- [payout reconciliation\nreport](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/payout-reconciliation)\n- [List Payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payouts/list)\n- [retrieve the Payout](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payouts/retrieve)\n- [BalanceTransaction](https://docs.stripe.com/api/balance_transactions)\n- [list\nBalanceTransaction](https://docs.stripe.com/api/balance_transactions/list)\n-\n[limit](https://docs.stripe.com/api/balance_transactions/list#balance_transaction_list-limit)\n- [auto-pagination](https://docs.stripe.com/api/pagination/auto)\n- [balance transaction\ntypes](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/balance-transaction-types#types)\n- [expand](https://docs.stripe.com/expand)",
