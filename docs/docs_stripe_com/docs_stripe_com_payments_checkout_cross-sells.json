Cross-sells can increase your average order value and revenue. For\nCheckout to offer a product as a cross-sell, the product must meet the following\ncriteria:\n\n- The product must be associated with only a single\n[Price](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/object#price_object-product).\n- The\n[currency](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/object#price_object-currency) of\nthe cross-sell product’s price must match the currency of the other prices in\nthe Checkout Session.\n- If the cross-sell product’s price\n[type](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/object#price_object-type) is\n`recurring`, the Checkout Session must be in subscription mode and its recurring\ninterval must match the recurring interval of the other prices in the Checkout\nSession.\n- If you’re using [subscription\nupsells](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/upsells), cross-sells only\nsupport products with non-recurring prices. For example, you can cross-sell a\none-time setup fee while also upselling a monthly subscription to annual\nbilling.\n- If you’re using [automatic taxes](https://docs.stripe.com/tax), cross-sells\nonly support products with prices with specified [tax\nbehavior](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/products-prices-tax-codes-tax-behavior#tax-behavior).\nYou can either [set tax behavior for a\nprice](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/products-prices-tax-codes-tax-behavior#setting-tax-behavior-on-a-price-(optional))\nor set the default tax behavior for all prices under [Tax\nSettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/tax) in the Stripe\nDashboard.\n\n## Create a cross-sell\n\n![Configure a cross-sell on the Product detail\npage](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/add-cross-sell.685564769c217a27f88b9ab9605d9c65.gif)\n\nConfigure a cross-sell on the Product detail page.\n\nYou can configure a cross-sell in the\n[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/products?active=true) on the Product\ndetails page. Visit the Product details page for the product from which you want\nto cross-sell another complementary product. You’ll see a **Cross-sells**\nsection with a dropdown menu containing your other Products. Select a Product\nwith a single Price. After you configure it, all eligible Checkout Sessions\ncross-sell the product selected from the dropdown menu. For example, a customer\npurchasing a ‘Togethere Professional’ subscription would be cross-sold the\n‘Professional Services: Deployment’ product.\n\n## Checkout flow\n\nIn Checkout, buyers see an option to add the cross-sell to their purchase. If\nbuyers add the cross-sell to the Checkout Session, they can also remove it. If\nthey remove it, the option to add the cross-sell appears again.\n\n#### Note\n\nThe quantity of cross-sell line items cannot be adjusted. The current maximum is\n1.\n\n![Customer preview of a cross-sell on the Product detail\npage](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/cross-sell-preview.cc9b1a4716015a18004f62de760cf29a.gif)\n\nCustomer preview.\n\n## Retrieve Checkout Session line items\n\nAfter a customer adds a cross-sell, the `line_items` for the Checkout Session\nupdate to reflect the addition. When [fulfilling your\norder](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/fulfillment#create-payment-event-handler)\nusing the `checkout.session.completed` webhook, make sure to [retrieve the line\nitems](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/line_items).\n\n## Remove a cross-sell\n\nYou can remove a cross-sell on the Product details page. After you remove it,\nthe product won’t be offered to any new Checkout Sessions.\n\n![Remove a cross-sell from the Product detail\npage](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/remove-cross-sell.a08765b1278a8187c282964f89641b92.gif)\n\nRemove a cross-sell.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Price](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/object#price_object-product)\n- [currency](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/object#price_object-currency)\n- [type](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/object#price_object-type)\n- [subscription upsells](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/upsells)\n- [automatic taxes](https://docs.stripe.com/tax)\n- [tax\nbehavior](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/products-prices-tax-codes-tax-behavior#tax-behavior)\n- [set tax behavior for a\nprice](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/products-prices-tax-codes-tax-behavior#setting-tax-behavior-on-a-price-(optional))\n- [Tax Settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/tax)\n- [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/products?active=true)\n- [fulfilling your\norder](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/fulfillment#create-payment-event-handler)\n- [retrieve the line\nitems](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/line_items)",
