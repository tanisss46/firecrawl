While these\ncalculation methods reflect the most common reporting scenarios, you can import\nCSV files and edit the amount on each 1099 form to better match the\nrequirements.\n\n#### Note\n\nStripe recommends that you consult a tax advisor to determine your tax filing\nand reporting requirements.\n\nAvailable calculation method1099-K1099-MISC1099-NECPayments including\nfeesYesYesYesPayments excluding feesYesYesYesPayouts onlyYesYes\n## Payments including fees\n\nThis payment calculation method includes all charges and transfers *including*\nany fees related to each transaction. Such fees might be:\n\n- Stripe processing and foreign currency conversion fees\n- Platform fees\n\nFor Form 1099-K, the IRS requires reporting [gross reportable\namounts](https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1099k#idm140262090779520) without any\nadjustments. It’s the taxpayer’s responsibility to determine their taxable\nincome by taking into account their business expenses and deductions.\n\nDepending on your business, you may determine this payment calculation method is\nalso appropriate for the amounts on their Forms 1099-MISC or 1099-NEC.\n\n#### Note\n\nRefunded charges aren’t deducted when using this calculation method.\n\n### Example 1\n\nOn December 31, 2020, a customer buys flowers for 100 USD from an online flower\nshop. The flower shop is a connected account and the [destination\ncharge](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges#flow-of-funds-app-fee)\nuses the platform’s API key. The charge authorization and capture time are the\nsame since partial authorization wasn’t specified. The platform retains a 2 USD\nplatform fee and a 3.20 USD Stripe fee nets directly out of the connected\naccount’s charge.\n\nOn January 2, 2021, the issuing bank settles the money to Stripe. On January 7,\n2021, a [payout](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts) occurs from the connected\naccount’s Stripe balance to their bank account, and includes the proceeds from\nthis sale. With this method, the platform can report 100 USD on their 1099 form\nfor 2021, and no amount for 2020.\n\nDescriptionAmountCustomer charged100 USDIncrease in connected account’s Stripe\nbalance94.80 USDIncrease in platform account’s Stripe balance2 USDAmount\nreported with this method100 USD\nAssume the same conditions, but a [direct\ncharge](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#flow-of-funds-with-fees)\nuses the connected account’s API key. With this method, the platform can report\nthe same 100 USD on their 1099 form for 2021.\n\n### Example 2\n\nAssume the same conditions as Example 1, but the connected account issues a\nrefund the same day as the charge because they’re unable to fulfill the order.\nIgnore any potential Stripe fees for refunds.\n\nDescriptionAmountCustomer charged100 USDCustomer refunded100 USDNet change in\nconnected account’s Stripe balance0 USDNet change in platform account’s Stripe\nbalance0 USDAmount reported with this method100 USD\nWith this method, the platform can report the same 100 USD on their 1099 form\nfor 2021, and no amount for 2020.\n\n## Payments excluding fees\n\nThis payment calculation method includes all charges and transfers *excluding*\nany fees related to each transaction. Such fees might be:\n\n- Stripe processing and foreign currency conversion fees\n- Platform fees\n\nThis method is useful if the platform wants to remove their fee from the amount\nreported for the connected account.\n\nFor example, in the [destination\ncharge](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges#flow-of-funds-app-fee)\nflow, the application fee is attributed to the connected account, but a platform\nmight pass the application fee to the end customer to pay the platform. Those\nfunds aren’t necessarily attributable or even known to the connected account.\nWhile platforms acknowledge that gross amounts should be reported to their\nconnected accounts on the Form 1099-K, they might think the gross amount to\nreport should be payments excluding fees.\n\nFor Form 1099-K, the IRS requires reporting gross amounts for all reportable\ntransactions, without any adjustments for refunds, fees, credits, cash\nequivalents, or discounts. Because platforms use\n[Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect) differently, we recommend working\nwith a tax advisor to determine if this method is right for you based on the\n1099 form you want to file.\n\nDepending on your business, you may determine this payment calculation method is\nalso appropriate for the amounts on their Forms 1099-MISC or 1099-NEC.\n\n#### Note\n\nStripe doesn’t deduct refunded charges when using this calculation method.\n\n### Example\n\nOn December 31, 2020, a customer buys flowers for 100 USD from an online flower\nshop. The flower shop is a connected account and the [destination\ncharge](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges#flow-of-funds-app-fee)\nuses the platform’s API key. The destination charge specifies an amount of 100\nUSD and a `transfer_data[amount]` of 94.80 USD. The charge authorization and\ncapture time are the same since partial authorization wasn’t specified. The\nplatform retains a 2 USD platform fee and a 3.20 USD Stripe fee nets directly\nout of the connected account’s charge.\n\nOn January 2, 2021, the issuing bank settles the money to Stripe. On January 7,\n2021, a payout occurs from the connected account’s Stripe balance to their bank\naccount, and includes the proceeds from this sale. With this method, the\nplatform can report 94.80 USD on their 1099 form for 2021, and no amount for\n2020.\n\nDescriptionAmountCustomer charged100 USDIncrease in connected account’s Stripe\nbalance94.80 USDIncrease in platform account’s Stripe balance2 USDAmount\nreported with this method94.80 USD\nAssume the same conditions, but the [destination\ncharge](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges#flow-of-funds-app-fee)\nspecifies an amount of 100 USD and an `application_fee_amount` of 5.20 USD. The\nStripe fee is deducted on the platform’s account from the 5.20 USD. With this\nmethod, the platform can report the same 94.80 USD on their 1099 form for 2021.\n\nAssume the same conditions, but a [direct\ncharge](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#flow-of-funds-with-fees)\nuses the connected account’s API key. The direct charge specifies an amount of\n100 USD and an `application_fee_amount` of 5.20 USD. With this method, the\nplatform can report the same 94.80 USD on their 1099 form for 2021.\n\n## Payouts only\n\nThe payouts only method lets you report only the amount that was paid out to the\nconnected account’s bank account, minus any payout reversals. The amount may\nalso include payments that aren’t related to a specific charge transaction. This\ncalculation method takes into consideration `payouts` and not `charges`.\n\nBecause platforms use Connect differently, we recommend working with a tax\nadvisor to determine if this method is right for you based on the 1099 form you\nwant to file.\n\n### Example\n\nOn December 31, 2020, a customer buys flowers for 100 USD from an online flower\nshop. The flower shop is a connected account and the [destination\ncharge](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges#flow-of-funds-app-fee)\nuses the platform’s API key.

On January 7,\n2021, a payout of 94.80 USD occurs from the connected account’s Stripe balance\nto their bank account, and includes the proceeds from this sale. With this\nmethod, the platform can report 94.80 USD on their 1099 form for 2021, and no\namount for 2020.\n\nDescriptionAmountCustomer charged100 USDIncrease in connected account’s Stripe\nbalance94.80 USDIncrease in platform account’s Stripe balance2 USDAmount\nreported with this method (2020)0 USDAmount reported with this method\n(2021)94.80 USD\nAssume the same conditions, but a [direct\ncharge](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#flow-of-funds-with-fees)\nuses the connected account’s API key. On January 7, 2021, a payout of 94.80 USD\noccurs from the connected account’s Stripe balance to their bank account, and\nincludes the proceeds from this sale. With this method, the platform can report\nthe same 94.80 USD on their 1099 form for 2021.\n\n## Additional calculation method topics\n\nThe following sections discuss calculation method topics that might be\napplicable to your platform.\n\n### Transactions included in calculations for the account\n\nThe inclusion of transactions in the Form 1099 calculations for the forms you\nwill issue depends on the connected account’s `controller.fees.payer` property.\n\n- Transactions on accounts where `controller.fees.payer` = `application_custom`\nor `application_express` are included in the calculations.\n- Transactions on accounts where `controller.fees.payer` = `application` could\nbe included if the application fees for those transactions are paid to the\nplatform. Otherwise, the transactions could be included in a Stripe-issued 1099.\n- Transactions on accounts where `controller.fees.payer` = `account` won’t be\nincluded, but instead could be included in a Stripe-issued 1099 to the account.\n\n### Timing and recognition of transactions\n\nStripe uses the [available_on\ndate](https://docs.stripe.com/api/balance_transactions/object#balance_transaction_object-available_on)\nof the balance transaction associated with the payment to determine which tax\nyear the transaction belongs to. The `available_on` date represents the date the\nfunds become available in the Stripe account. We believe this approach best\nmatches the IRS’s instructions.\n\n### Card not present payments\n\nIRS Form 1099-K box “1b” reports the volume of “card not present” payments.\nStripe classifies a payment as “card present” or “card not present” based on the\n[PaymentMethod\ntype](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object#payment_method_object-type)\nassociated with that payment. The following PaymentMethod `type` values are\n“card present”. All others are “card not present”:\n\n- `card_present`\n- `interac_present`\n\n### Tax form totals\n\nWe recommend that platforms audit Stripe transactions that have contributed to a\nform’s totals by [exporting the transaction\nlog](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/calculation-methods#export-transaction-logs).\n\nAccount transactions performed outside of Stripe aren’t included in form totals.\nTo include non-Stripe transactions, platforms must manually adjust the form box\namounts before filing.\n\nTransactions created with the [Transfers\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers) to credit connected accounts (for\nexample, handling dispute reversals and refund failures) are included in 1099-K\nform totals. Debits from connected accounts are excluded. To remove these credit\ntransfers from the form, platforms must manually adjust the form box amounts\nbefore filing.\n\n### Separate charges and transfers\n\nStripe derives the reportable amount for a separate charge and transfer from the\ntransfer, not the charge.\n\nAdditionally, you must use the [source_transaction\nparameter](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers/object#transfer_object-source_transaction)\nto associate a charge with a transfer from your platform to a connected\naccount—Stripe classifies any transfers without this parameter as “card not\npresent” transactions.\n\nIf you initially created a separate charge and transfer with a link from the\ntransfer to the charge and later updated the `Charge` object to include the\ntransfer, we treat it like a destination charge in calculations. The gross\namount on your draft form might change if you’ve opted to include fees, as we’ll\nnow include the charge in our considerations.\n\n### Foreign exchange rate conversions\n\nStripe’s 1099 calculation methods convert non-USD transactions to USD using the\nmarket exchange rate from the day the transaction is created. This method might\nyield a different value than the Stripe Dashboard shows because we compute that\nvalue using an intra-day exchange rate adjusted for Stripe’s foreign exchange\nfee.\n\n### Cancelled asynchronous payments\n\nIf a user cancels an asynchronous payment (for example, ACH debit) that would’ve\notherwise been successful before the payment completes, that payment might still\nbe included in the results of the “payments including fees” and “payments\nexcluding fees” methods.\n\n## Export transaction logs\n\nFor tax year 2022 and later, you can use the [Stripe\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/taxes/forms) to export the\ntransaction log of each 1099 form. A transaction log lists the Stripe\ntransactions that have contributed to a form’s total. This log allows you to\naudit transaction discrepancies and answer questions from your connected\naccounts about which transactions Stripe includes in their tax forms.\n\nAfter you export the transaction log, the sum of its **Calculation Amount**\ncolumn reflects the form total that you see on the 1099. For each transaction,\nwe show the applicable **merchant_id**, **balance_transaction_id**,\n**charge_id**, and **transfer_id** along with the calculation amount relevant to\nthat transaction. The calculation amount is dependent on the type of calculation\nmethod you choose. The 1099-K form transaction logs list\n**card_not_present_volume** and **transaction_count** to match the values on the\nform.\n\n#### Note\n\nTransaction logs only contain Stripe transactions. [Manual\nupdates](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/modify-tax-forms) through CSV imports\nor the Dashboard’s Tax form editor won’t be included in the transaction log.\n\nTo export the transaction log of a tax form:\n\n- Navigate to the [Tax\nreporting](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/taxes/forms) page in the\nDashboard.\n- Select the checkbox next to the tax form.\n- Click the overflow menu () at the top-right of the tax form and select\n**Export transaction log**.\n- Specify the date range and rows that you want to export. Use the default\nexport settings to capture all the details of the entire year. The transaction\nlog file downloads in your browser. Keep the email notification option selected\nif you want to receive an email containing a link to download your transaction\nlog.\n\nThe transaction log file downloads after Stripe finishes the export process. If\nyou exported with the email notification option selected, Stripe also sends you\nan email from `notification@stripe.com` with a link to download your transaction\nlog.\n\n## Links\n\n- [gross reportable\namounts](https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1099k#idm140262090779520)\n- [destination\ncharge](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges#flow-of-funds-app-fee)\n- [payout](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts)\n- [direct\ncharge](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#flow-of-funds-with-fees)\n- [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)\n- [available_on\ndate](https://docs.stripe.com/api/balance_transactions/object#balance_transaction_object-available_on)\n- [PaymentMethod\ntype](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object#payment_method_object-type)\n- [exporting the transaction\nlog](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/calculation-methods#export-transaction-logs)\n- [Transfers API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n- [source_transaction\nparameter](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers/object#transfer_object-source_transaction)\n- [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/taxes/forms)\n- [Manual updates](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/modify-tax-forms)",
