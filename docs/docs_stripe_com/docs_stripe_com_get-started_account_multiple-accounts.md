# Multiple separate accounts

## Learn how to create and manage multiple separate Stripe accounts.

You must use separate Stripe accounts for projects, websites, or businesses that
operate independently from one another. When you activate a new account, it’s
subject to Stripe’s standard policies and pricing—it doesn’t inherit any special
status or other similar considerations that might apply to your existing
account.

#### Note

If you operate multiple accounts related to the same business, such as for local
acquiring or maintaining separate business lines, you can create an
[organization](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/orgs) for centralized
reporting and management.

You can create additional Stripe accounts associated with your email address.
You might create some accounts yourself, or you might be given access to other
accounts as a [team member](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/teams).
To create a new account, click on the name of your current Stripe account in the
upper-left corner, and select **New account**. To switch the account you’re
currently viewing in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/), click on
the name of your current Stripe account in the upper-left corner and then select
the account to switch to.

Using additional accounts has a number of benefits:

- **Separate tax and legal entity information**: You can only associate each
account with the tax ID and legal entity of one business. If you operate
multiple businesses that have separate tax ID information (for example, separate
legal entities), you must create additional accounts for each.
- **Unique statement descriptor and public business information**: Using the
same Stripe account for separate businesses can cause confusion as the [public
business
information](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/activate#public-business-information)
used is the same for both. For example, a customer who purchases from your
business “XYZ” might see a charge from your business “ABC” on their statement,
potentially resulting in a dispute. Each additional account has its own public
information to accurately describe your business and payments.
- **Reporting and reconciliation**: Separating the payments processed by your
businesses helps you find payments, create and export
[reports](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-reports), and reconcile payouts to your
bank account.
- **Payouts to separate bank accounts**: Each additional account can use a
separate bank account for [payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts) (although
you can use the same bank account if you want).

When you have multiple projects or businesses that operate under the same legal
entity, you can use the same tax ID and business information across multiple
accounts. Make sure to provide suitable [public business
information](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/activate#public-business-information)
to avoid customer confusion.
