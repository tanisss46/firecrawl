If you’re a funded business with a dedicated team of developers,\nor simply working with a single developer, include those details in the form.\n\nAfter you submit the form, our team will reach out within 5 days to let you know\nif your use case is a good fit. We also let you know if we think your desired\nproduct or products don’t [serve your use\ncase](https://support.stripe.com/questions/supported-business-use-cases-for-stripe-issuing)\nwell. During the call, an assigned Stripe account representative asks you more\nabout your use case and motivation as part of our supportability assessment. We\nalso advise you on best practices and how to build a [compelling financial\nservices offering](https://stripe.com/guides/building-a-fintech-company).\n\nFollowing the call, we’ll inform you whether we can support your business within\n5 business days (certain use cases can take longer). While you wait, you can\nbuild a [test mode](https://docs.stripe.com/test-mode) integration to explore\nthe product’s capabilities, and familiarize yourself with our compliance\nrequirements. If we deem your use case supportable, your account representative\nprovides you with any necessary agreements, and once signed, configures your\nprogram.\n\n## Milestone 2: Obtain live mode access\n\nTo obtain live mode access, you must complete the required compliance tasks. In\nparallel, we recommend you build your integration in a production environment\nand operationalize required processes.\n\n### Build your integration\n\nAt any time, you can explore an integration in test mode using our [sample\napp](https://docs.stripe.com/baas/start-integration/sample-app).
