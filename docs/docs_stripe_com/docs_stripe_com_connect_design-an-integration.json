Before starting your integration in\ntest mode, you must:\n\n- Create a Stripe Account\n- Begin filling out your platform profile\n\n## Select properties\n\n### Create and onboard accounts\n\nStripe enables you to create accounts on behalf of users, called connected\naccounts. When using Connect, you create connected accounts for each user that\nreceives money on your platform.\n\nOnboarding:Onboarding:HostedEmbeddedAPI\nSend connected accounts to a Stripe-hosted onboarding flow. Stripe-hosted\nonboarding allows you to redirect your user to Stripe to complete the onboarding\nprocess in a co-branded interface.\n\n![Screenshot of Connect Onboarding\nform](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/Kavholm-Seamless-Standard.78b64d90c0bf87130c8b6ba1ef53df7f.png)\n\nBest for when you want to launch quickly with the lowest integration effort:\n\n- Connected accounts leave your site and are redirected to Stripe to complete\nthe flow.\n- Co-branding with Stripe and limited options to customize.\n- Stripe handles all of the onboarding flow logic.\n- Automatically supports 46+ countries and 14 languages.\n\n### Set up dashboard flows\n\nConnected accounts need access to a dashboard to manage their account. Provide\nconnected accounts with access to the Stripe Dashboard, the Express Dashboard,\nor a dashboard built using the Stripe API and embedded components.\n\nDashboard access:Dashboard access:StripeExpressNone\nProvide access to the Stripe Dashboard to connected accounts.\n\nThe Stripe Dashboard provides connected accounts with a full suite of\nfunctionality, including viewing payouts, managing refunds, handling disputes,\naccessing reporting, and processing charges on their own. Users can sign into\ntheir Stripe Dashboard at any time and can access the Dashboard by visiting\nStripe directly. Users have access to Stripe support and Stripe can reach out\nand communicate with users about their account.\n\nUse the Stripe Dashboard when:\n\n- Your users need access to powerful payments workflows and advanced user\nmanagement features.\n- You prefer Stripe to manage risk of loss and take responsibility for negative\nbalance liability on connected accounts.\n- You are comfortable with Stripe branding and limited platform co-branding.\n\nYou can always add [embedded\ncomponents](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\nto your own website in tandem with providing access to the Stripe Dashboard.\n\n### Accept a payment\n\nYou create a charge to accept a payment from a customer on behalf of your\nconnected account. The type of charge you create:\n\n- Determines how payment funds are split among all parties involved\n- Impacts how the charge appears on the customer’s bank or billing statement\n(with your platform’s information or your user’s)\n- Determines which account Stripe debits for refunds and chargebacks\n\nCharge type:Charge type:DirectDestinationSeparate charges and transfers\nA direct charge is a customer payment made directly to a connected account.\nCustomers directly transact with your connected account, often unaware of your\nplatform’s existence.\n\nThis charge type is best suited for platforms providing software as a service.\nFor example, Shopify provides tools for building online storefronts, and\nThinkific enables educators to sell online courses.\n\n### Stripe fees\n\nWho pays fees:Who pays fees:Your connected accountsYour platform\nStripe collects Stripe fees directly from your connected accounts. You can\ncollect an optional application fee when you create the direct charge.\n\nCustomerConnected account\n$10 Charge\n\n($1.23) Application fee\n\n$1.23 Application fee\n\nPlatform\n($0.59) Stripe fees\n\n$8.18 net\n\nStripeDirect charge\n### Pay out users\n\nWhen the funds from the payment settle and your user’s connected account has a\npositive Stripe balance, you can pay out those funds to their external account.\n\nBy default, Stripe pays out funds that have settled in your connected accounts’\nbalances on a daily rolling basis. If you prefer, you can configure different\nautomatic payout schedules, trigger payouts manually instead of automatically,\nor pay out instantly.\n\n### Responsibility for negative balances\n\nNegative balance liability:Negative balance liability:StripePlatform\nStripe monitors risk signals on connected accounts, implements risk\ninterventions on connected accounts in response to observed signals, and seeks\nto recover negative balances from your connected accounts.\n\nFor most software as a service platforms, this is the best default choice,\nespecially for those that are new to embedding payments:\n\n- Stripe monitors your connected accounts for credit and fraud risk, as well as\nprotection against risk of loss in the event of negative balances attributed to\nbusiness risk.\n- Stripe handles all the end to end communications and remediations directly\nwith your connected accounts through hosted flows or embedded components.\n\n## Your personalized guide\n\nThis list of steps is customized based on your choices above.
