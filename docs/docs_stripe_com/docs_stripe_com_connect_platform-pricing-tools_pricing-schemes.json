  "content": "# Create a pricing scheme\n\n## Define custom pricing strategies to assess your connected accounts.\n\nA pricing scheme is a list of conditional fees. For each applicable transaction,\nStripe evaluates the list in the order you specify and applies the first\nmatching conditional fee. If no conditional fees match the transaction, Stripe\napplies your default fee. Stripe calculates the fee in the specified currency,\nand then converts it to the settlement currency of the payment, if needed.\n\nTo create a pricing scheme:\n\n- From the [Platform\npricing](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/platform_pricing) page in\nyour Stripe Dashboard (**Settings** > **Connect** > **Platform pricing**), click\n**Get Started**.\n- In the **Set a default payment pricing scheme** editor, click **Add pricing\nrule**.\n- Define the rule.- **Condition**: Use the dropdown menus to write one or more\nconditions based on a transaction property, an operator, and a value.\n- **Fee type**: Specify how to calculate the fee.- **Fixed**: Charge a specific\namount, such as 1.10 USD, for every payment.\n- **Variable**: Charge a percentage, such as .45%, of the total amount of the\npayment.- Minimum (optional): Specify a minimum amount to charge, even if the\npercentage calculation is less.\n- Maximum (optional): Specify a maximum amount to charge, even if the percentage\ncalculation is more.\n- **Blended**: Charge a percentage of the total payment, plus a fixed amount.-\nMaximum (optional): Specify a maximum amount to charge, even if the calculated\nfee is more.\n\n![Shows the Add pricing rule dialog in the\nDashboard.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/customize-pricing-dialog.a5c604b458b41a572834087aa0d7118a.png)\n\n- Add up to 125 rules for the scheme in the order to evaluate them. Stripe\napplies the first rule that matches the payment and discontinues the evaluation.\n- After you define all your pricing rules, **Set fallback rule** lets you define\nthe fee to apply when a transaction doesn’t match any of the scheme rules. - Set\na variable amount, fixed amount, or both.\n- If you set a zero amount fallback rule fee, you won’t recoup your processing\ncost for any transactions that don’t match any of the scheme rules.\n- (Optional) Click [Add\nmodifier](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/platform-pricing-tools/pricing-schemes#fee-modifier)\nto increase or decrease the calculated application fee by a specified percentage\n(0-100).\n- Click **Save and enable** or close the editor without saving to cancel.\n\n#### Explicit application fees override pricing scheme\n\nEnabled pricing tools apply fees to all eligible payments, unless overridden by\nan explicit `application_fee` or `transfer_data[amount]` parameter on the\npayment. Remove these parameters from your payment integration to apply your\npricing scheme configuration.\n\nSaving the pricing scheme applies it to all eligible connected accounts. You can\nview the progress of this update on your [Platform\nPricing](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/platform_pricing/payments)\npage. The time to complete depends on the number of connected accounts on your\nplatform.\n\nReview Stripe’s [Pricing page](http://stripe.com/pricing) for guidance in\ndefining your pricing schemes. Factors to consider include, but aren’t limited\nto:\n\n- Which countries you support connected accounts in\n- Whether any connected accounts support cross-border transactions\n- Which payment methods you support\n- How much Stripe charges you based on your contract\n\n## Override a specific account\n\nAfter you set up a pricing scheme, you can override the rules for connected\naccounts if the fee payer is the platform.\n\n- Select the account from the [Connected\naccounts](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/accounts/overview) page in your\nDashboard.\n- In the **Account Pricing** section, click the Payment pricing default overflow\nmenu () and select **Customize pricing** to create a new override, or click\n**Edit** to update an existing override, if one exists.\n- For a new override scheme, choose:- **Create a new scheme**: define the\noverride rules from scratch.\n- ** from default platform pricing scheme**: define the override rules by\nediting your default platform scheme.\n- Create the override scheme for the connected account using the same steps for\ncreating the default platform scheme in the previous section.\n- Click **Save** or close the editor without saving to cancel.\n\n## Revert overridden pricing schemes\n\nAfter you create an override scheme, any updates to your platform pricing scheme\ndon’t affect the pricing scheme of overridden connected accounts. To reapply\nyour platform pricing scheme to an overridden connected account:\n\n- Select the account from the [Connected\naccounts](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/accounts/overview) page in your\nDashboard.\n- In the **Account Pricing** section, click the Custom scheme overflow menu ()\nand select **Revert to platform pricing**.\n\n## Export pricing schemes\n\nYou can export all pricing schemes as CSV files. To export your platform pricing\nscheme:\n\n- From the Platform pricing page in your Stripe Dashboard (**Settings** >\n**Connect** > **Platform pricing**), click **Get Started**.\n- Navigate to the overflow menu () next to a scheme. Under **Scheme actions**,\nselect **Export pricing**.\n- When you export pricing, it downloads a file with the name `pricing-<schema\nname>-<live|testmode>.csv`\n\nTo export an override scheme:\n\n- Select the account from the Connected accounts page in your Dashboard.\n- In the **Account Pricing** section, click the Custom scheme overflow menu ()\nand select **Export pricing**.\n- When you export pricing, it downloads a file with the name `pricing-<connected\naccount>-<schema name>-<live|testmode>.csv`\n\n### Available columns\n\nColumn nameDescriptionRule #This is the rule number as shown in the pricing\nscheme.Fee modifier #If present, the “Rule #” column is empty.

For\nexample, adding a 5% discount followed by a 10% markup adjusts a 1.00 USD fee to\na 1.05 USD fee (1.00 USD × 0.95 x 1.1 = 1.05 USD).\n\n## View platform pricing details\n\nSelect an applied fee from [Collected\nFees](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/application_fees) on the Payments\npage in your Dashboard. The **Platform pricing** details section shows the\nfollowing details about how Stripe calculated the application fee from the\npricing scheme:\n\n- **Matched rules**: Shows which rule conditions matched the payment and were\nused to calculate the fee based on the captured payment and fee type.\n- **Additional markups applied**: Shows whether the final calculation included\nany markups or discount adjustments.\n- **Historical pricing scheme**: Shows a snapshot of the pricing scheme in place\nat the time of payment processing and fee calculation.\n\nFor example, assume a purchase of 500 USD. The payment matched a rule with the\nfollowing conditions of the pricing scheme:\n\n- The payment method is cards.\n\nThe pricing scheme also applied the following fee modifiers:\n\n- 4% markup\n- 3% discount\n\nFor this case, the platform pricing details show:\n\n- The 2.9% + 0.30 USD rule applies because the payment method is a card. The\ncalculation against the 500 USD payment equals a fee subtotal of 14.80 USD.\n- The scheme also defines a 4% markup and a 3% discount. This calculates 14.8 ×\n1.04 × 0.97 = 14.93024, rounding to a total fee charged to the connected account\nof 14.93 USD.\n\n![Sample application fee details shown in the\nDashboard.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/view-fee-calculation.375a290a9a613cb4b4ae7c2b71005267.png)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Platform\npricing](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/platform_pricing)\n- [Platform\nPricing](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/platform_pricing/payments)\n- [Pricing page](http://stripe.com/pricing)\n- [Connected accounts](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/accounts/overview)\n- [Card product\ncode](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/platform-pricing-tools/card-product-codes)\n- [create pricing rules based on this\nmetadata](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/platform-pricing-tools/complex-pricing-rule-conditions#metadata)\n- [Collected Fees](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/application_fees)",
