Stripe ranks the\npayment methods that are enabled within that configuration to optimize for\nconversion.\n\n## Before you begin\n\n- You must use either the Stripe [Payment\nElement](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element) or\n[Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout).\n- You must use [Dynamic payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/dynamic-payment-methods)\nto enable additional payment methods from the Stripe Dashboard, which won’t\nrequire any code changes.- To set up dynamic payment methods for direct users,\nsee the [payment method\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/dynamic-payment-methods)\nguide.\n- Connect To set up dynamic payment methods for Connect platforms, see\n[Upgrading to dynamic payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dynamic-payment-methods).\n[Create a payment method\nconfiguration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-method-configurations#create-payment-method-configuration)\nBy default, you have one payment method configuration called **Default Config**.\nYou can create additional payment method configurations using both the Stripe\nDashboard and the API.\n\nDashboardAPI- In your Dashboard, go to [Payment methods\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/payment_methods).\n- In the **Configuration Management** section, click the overflow menu (), then\nselect **Create a configuration**.\n- Give your new configuration a name.\n- Click **Save configuration**.\n\n![Payment method configuration\npage](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/payment-method-configurations.a766550ad4dd95854a7a9b9f178e1d45.png)\n\nThe page displays your new configuration. All payment methods are initially\ndisabled by default.\n\nTo switch between configurations, use the **Select configuration** dropdown near\nthe top of the page.\n\n[Enable payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-method-configurations#enable-payment-methods)\nIn the Dashboard, open the configuration and turn on the payment methods that\nyou want to make available to buyers when using that configuration. A buyer sees\nonly payment methods that are turned on and compatible with the payment location\nand currency.\n\n#### Note\n\nSome payment methods don’t show edit controls until you expand them.\n\n[Display available payment methods in\ncheckout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-method-configurations#section-4)\n the `configuration ID` in the Dashboard from the configuration you want to\nuse in your checkout flow.\n\nIf you’re using the [deferred intent creation integration\npath](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment-deferred), pass the\n`payment_method_configuration` ID when you create your Payment Element\ncomponent. The Payment Element automatically pulls the payment methods\nassociated with that configuration and ranks them to best convert buyers.\n\nWebiOSAndroid\n```\nconst options = {\n mode: 'payment',\n amount: 1099,\n currency: 'usd',\n payment_method_configuration: 'pmc_234'\n}\n```\n\nIf you aren’t using a Payment Element, pass the `payment_method_configuration`\nID when you [create a Checkout\nsession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create).\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/checkout/sessions \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d mode=payment \\\n -d \"line_items[0][price]\"={{PRICE_ID}} \\\n -d \"line_items[0][quantity]\"=1 \\\n --data-urlencode success_url=\"https://example.com/success\" \\\n --data-urlencode cancel_url=\"https://example.com/cancel\" \\\n -d currency=usd \\\n -d payment_method_configuration=pmc_234\n```\n\n### Payment methods\n\nBy default, Stripe enables cards and other common payment methods. You can turn\nindividual payment methods on or off in the [Stripe\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods). In Checkout,\nStripe evaluates the currency and any restrictions, then dynamically presents\nthe supported payment methods to the customer.\n\nTo see how your payment methods appear to customers, enter a transaction ID or\nset an order amount and currency in the Dashboard.\n\nYou can enable Apple Pay and Google Pay in your [payment methods\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods). By default,\nApple Pay is enabled and Google Pay is disabled. However, in some cases Stripe\nfilters them out even when they’re enabled. We filter Google Pay if you [enable\nautomatic tax](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/checkout) without collecting a\nshipping address.\n\nCheckout’s Stripe-hosted pages don’t need integration changes to enable Apple\nPay or Google Pay. Stripe handles these payments the same way as other card\npayments.\n\n[Create a PaymentIntent with the\nconfiguration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-method-configurations#create-payment-intent)\nCreate a PaymentIntent on your server using the payment method configuration.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d amount=1000 \\\n -d currency=usd \\\n -d \"automatic_payment_methods[enabled]\"=true \\\n -d payment_method_configuration=pmc_123\n```\n\nIn the latest version of the API, the `automatic_payment_methods` parameter is\noptional because it’s enabled by default.\n\n## Links\n\n- [dynamic payment\nmethod](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/dynamic-payment-methods)\n- [Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element)\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout)\n- [Upgrading to dynamic payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dynamic-payment-methods)\n- [Payment methods\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/payment_methods)\n- [deferred intent creation integration\npath](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment-deferred)\n- [create a Checkout\nsession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create)\n- [https://example.com/success](https://example.com/success)\n- [https://example.com/cancel](https://example.com/cancel)\n- [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods)\n- [enable automatic tax](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/checkout)",
