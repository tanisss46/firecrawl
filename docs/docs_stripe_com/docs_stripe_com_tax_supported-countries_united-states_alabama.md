## Learn how to use Stripe Tax to calculate, collect, and report tax in Alabama.

## When to register for tax collection

See [Thresholds](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/thresholds) to get insights
about your potential tax registration obligations in Alabama. Stripe also
notifies you with email and Dashboard alerts when you need to register to
collect tax. Learn more about how the [monitoring tool
works](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/monitoring).

Remote sellers must register to collect and remit tax in Alabama when, in the
previous calendar year, they exceed a sales threshold of 250,000 USD.

The threshold includes retail sales of tangible personal property, whether
taxable or nontaxable. The threshold excludes sales of services, wholesale sales
(sales for resale), and marketplace sales.

## Register to collect tax

Register for sales tax in Alabama at the [tax
authority](https://www.revenue.alabama.gov/sales-use/sales-tax/). Read more
about registering for [sales tax in the US in our
guide](https://stripe.com/guides/sales-tax-registration-process-us). You can
also use [Stripe to
register](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/use-stripe-to-register) on your behalf.

Remote sellers with no physical presence in Alabama can register for the
[Simplified Sellers Use
Tax](https://www.revenue.alabama.gov/sales-use/simplified-sellers-use-tax-ssut/).
The program allows you to collect a single tax rate on all sales into the state,
instead of collecting local taxes. You can collect this tax after enrolling on
the [My Alabama Taxes website](https://myalabamataxes.alabama.gov/_/).

After you’ve registered to collect tax in Alabama, go to
[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations?location=us-al)
to add your registrations to Stripe in the Dashboard. This turns on tax
calculation and collection in Stripe for your transactions there. You’ll be able
to indicate which tax program you’re registered for in Alabama as part of adding
your registration to Stripe.

registration](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/registering#track-your-registrations-in-the-tax-dashboard)
in the Dashboard.

## How we calculate taxes

Stripe calculates the taxes that apply to your customer’s location.

If you selected the Simplified Sellers Use Tax program in Stripe then we will
calculate and collect the simplified rate. You can change this by [editing the
tax registration](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/registering#edit-a-registration)
on the **Dashboard**.

## Report and file your taxes

Stripe provides reports of your completed tax transactions. Go to
[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations) to access these
reports.

### Exports

The tax transaction data export provides a comprehensive and aggregated view of
transactions by location, including a breakdown of individual tax amounts. Learn
more about [tax reporting exports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports#exports).

### Location reports

[Location reports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports#us-location-reports)
offer a summary of transaction and refund data for specific US locations and
align with Alabama filing requirements. You have the option to report on an
annual, quarterly, or monthly basis.

### Filing

Stripe Tax has filing partners—Taxually, Marosa, and Hands-off Sales Tax
(HOST)—to help automate your tax filing. These partners automatically sync your
tax transaction data in real time, eliminating the need for manual data entry or
file transfers. Learn more about [tax
filing](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/filing).
