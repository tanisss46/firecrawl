# Balance transactions with refunds or disputes now specify the corresponding ID in the source fieldBreaking changes

## What’s new

Updates the `Balance Transaction` object to provide the refund ID or dispute ID
as the `source` value when the balance transaction is associated with a refund
or dispute. Previously, the original charge ID was shown.

## Impact

The `Balance Transaction` object’s `source` value now provides a refund or
dispute ID when applicable, offering more specific transaction source
information.
