# Replaces the forgiven field with a new uncollectible status for invoicesBreaking changes

## What’s new

Replaces the `forgiven` field with a new `uncollectible` status for invoices.

## Impact

Check for the `uncollectible` status instead of the `forgiven` field to identify
invoices that have been marked as uncollectible. This modification requires
updates to existing code that processes invoice statuses, particularly for
handling uncollectible debts.
