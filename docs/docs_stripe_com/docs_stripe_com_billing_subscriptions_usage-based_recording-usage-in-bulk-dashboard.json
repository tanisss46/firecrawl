To record usage, you can manually add usage data or upload a CSV\nfile with the usage data in the Dashboard. Stripe parses, validates, and\ntransforms the usage data into meter events.\n\nAfter the events upload successfully, you can see them in the live meter feed.\nYou can also check the status of your uploaded files on the [Data\nmanagement](https://dashboard.stripe.com/data-management/import-set) page.\n\n## Add usage data manually\n\nYou can manually add usage data on the\n[Meters](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/meters) page in the Stripe Dashboard.\n\n- On the [Meters](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/meters) page, select the\nmeter name.\n- On the meter page, click **Add usage** > **Manually input usage**.\n- On the **Add usage** page, do the following:- Select your customer from the\n**Customer** dropdown.\n- For **Value**, enter a sample value.\n- Click **Submit**.\n\n## Upload a CSV file with usage data\n\nAfter you prepare your CSV file with the usage data, you can upload it in the\nStripe Dashboard. Make sure to format your file to match the template that’s\navailable in the Dashboard. The maximum file size allowed is 5 MB.\n\n### CSV file format and fields\n\nMake sure your CSV file follows this sample file format:\n\n`timestamp``event_name``payload_stripe_customer_id``payload_value`2024-09-25ai_search_apicus_QMJJtcu70R1x464002024-09-26ai_search_apicus_GAXJtSu6021a6s6002024-09-27cpu_usagecus_Qz0fwcfSysB9Z3600\nFollow the [Meter Event](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event/object)\nschema when including the following fields in your file:\n\nFieldDescription\n`timestamp`\n\nThe date that the event occurred.

If you specified a different key in the `value_settings`, you must update\nthe column name to match the key value.

After you fix the errors, you can upload the\nupdated file.\n\n- On the [Meters](https://dashboard.stripe.com/meters) page, select the meter\nname that you want to add usage events to.\n- On the meter page, click **Add usage** > **Upload file to add usage**.\n- On the **Upload file to add usage** page, select your file.\n- Click **Upload file**.\n- Verify the meter event count and aggregated value on the meter page.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Data management](https://dashboard.stripe.com/data-management/import-set)\n- [Meters](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/meters)\n- [Meter Event](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event/object)\n- [Customer ID](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-id)\n- [Customers](https://dashboard.stripe.com/customers)\n- [Meters](https://dashboard.stripe.com/meters)",
