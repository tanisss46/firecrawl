# Collect tax in Australia

## Learn how to use Stripe Tax to calculate, collect, and report tax in Australia.

In Australia, Stripe Tax supports calculation and [collection of
GST](https://www.ato.gov.au/business/gst/).

## When to register for tax collection

See [Thresholds](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/thresholds) to get insights
about your potential tax registration obligations in Australia. Stripe also
notifies you with email and Dashboard alerts when you need to register to
collect tax. Learn more about how the [monitoring tool
works](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/monitoring).

Remote sellers must register in Australia if their sales of services or
low-value goods to Australian individuals exceed 75,000 AUD in the past 12
months or are expected to in the next 12 months. Sales to GST-registered
Australian businesses that are subject to reverse charge don’t count toward the
threshold. Non-profit organizations who sell remotely have a higher 150,000 AUD
threshold but the threshold monitoring tool doesn’t track this.

**Threshold**: 75,000 AUD (or 150,000 AUD for non-profit organizations)

**Time frame**: Previous or current year.

**Included transactions**: Any taxable transactions that reverse charge doesn’t
apply to.

Stripe supports domestic registration in Australia for both Australian
businesses and remote sellers.

If a remote business sells digital services or low-value goods into Australia
exclusively through online marketplaces that are responsible for collecting tax
on these sales, the seller isn’t required to register for GST in Australia.
These sales don’t count toward the seller’s registration threshold.

## How we calculate taxes

Stripe calculates GST for your transactions in Australia. Stripe assumes most
sales to be taxable unless specifically exempt. If you’re a remote seller and
sell services to Australian customers, GST is typically collected on sales to
individuals. No tax is charged on sales to business customers who provide their
Australian Business Register (ABN) number.

Stripe doesn’t calculate GST on sales of imported low-value goods (valued 1,000
AUD or less) to Australian individuals.

## Report and file your taxes

Stripe provides reports of your completed tax transactions. Go to
[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations) to access these
reports. Learn more about [the different types of
reports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports).

You’re responsible for filing and remitting your taxes to Australia. Stripe
doesn’t file taxes on your behalf. However, we do have trusted partners who can
help manage your filing and remittance.

## Marketplace tax liability

Australia defines electronic distribution platform (EDP) operators as
marketplace operators that might have tax collection obligations. To qualify as
an EDP, a marketplace operator must set terms or conditions for the sale,
process or enable customer payments, or handle ordering or delivery of the
product. Businesses that only provides payment processing or maintain the
technical infrastructure behind an online marketplace don’t qualify as EDPs. EDP
operators must collect GST on:

- Sales of imported low-value goods by remote sellers to private individuals in
Australia.
- Sales of digital services by remote sellers to private individuals in
Australia.
