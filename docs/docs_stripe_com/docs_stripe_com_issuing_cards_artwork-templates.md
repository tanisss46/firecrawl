# Artwork templates

## Add your artwork to the design templates.

Stripe provides design templates (Adobe Illustrator) for cards, carriers, and
envelopes. We recommend the following best practices to optimize the artwork for
the printing process. If you’re not familiar with Illustrator templates, Stripe
can help review and update the template to meet the criteria.

Upload card artwork in design template

**General**

- **Card size:** 85.6 mm x 53.98 mm.
- **Artwork size:** Minimum 87.6 mm x 55.98 mm, including a 1 mm bleed on all
sides.
- **Logos and text:** Keep a 2 mm distance from the card edge to avoid important
elements being cut off.
- **Thin linework:** Minimum line thickness accepted is .08 mm or .25 point
(pt).

**Type and logos**

- **Minimum type size for San Serif Fonts:** 4.5 pts.
- **Minimum type size for Serif Fonts:** 5 pts.
- Position logos and text at least 2 mm away from non-printed elements such as
chips, holograms, signature panels, magnetic stripes, and so on.
- Create type and logos in a vector program for cleaner artwork and maintain
sharpness and clarity.
- Provide the fonts used in your artwork to avoid font compatibility issues.

**Linked images**

- Raster images (JPG, TIFF, PNG) work best in a minimum resolution of 350 ppi
for good print quality.
- Include all linked images with your artwork.
- Linked images must be in CMYK, grayscale, multichannel, or duotone color mode
(avoid RGB color mode).
Upload carrier artwork in design template- **Bleeds**: Include 1/8 (0.125")
bleeds on all sides of the artwork. This ensures that there’s enough room for
trimming during the printing process.
- **File Resolution**: For any artwork or photos, make sure they have a
resolution of at least 300 dpi (dots per inch). Additionally, include all
placed, linked, or embedded images with the final files.
- **Color and Treatments**: For better color matching, we recommend choosing PMS
colors for reference. Specify the color mode directly in the Illustrator file or
include an accompanying CMF (Color Matching File) document. The paper used for
the cards can’t have thermographic, high gloss, coated, or varnish finishes. The
carriers provided are suited for laser printing.
Additional best practices- **Limit light colors**: Exercise caution when using
light colors for large areas, as there might be a more noticeable color shift
from card to card.
- **Limit dark gradients**: Dark gradients in your artwork might lead to
unexpected results, so we suggest limiting their use.
- **Use black and gray**: Avoid using CMYK builds to achieve black and gray
colors. Instead, create the artwork using solid black, a percentage of black, or
a PMS gray to make sure more accurate and consistent results.
- **Avoid border designs**: Due to slight movement during the cutting process,
it’s challenging to guarantee perfectly even borders all the way around the
card. Keep this in mind if your artwork includes a border design.
- **Large solid gray areas**: For large, solid gray areas, we recommend using
specific PMS colors. Light Gray—PMS 428, Medium Gray—PMS 430, and Dark Gray—PMS
430, as they provide consistent results.
- **Matte finish and solid color artwork**: Cards that are mostly black or have
solid color artwork with a matte finish might show surface scratches more easily
compared to a gloss finish and varied artwork.
