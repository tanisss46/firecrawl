  "content": "# Import card data\n\n## Migrate your card data, including default cards, limitations, and address validations.\n\nWhen you migrate card data from your previous processor, you can import the data\nin Stripe as the default payment method card (`pm_`) object or a legacy card\n(`card_`) object. The Payment Intents API supports all Stripe products for both\ncard payment types, but your integration might favor one based on the following\nconsiderations.\n\n- If you’re using a third-party subscription platform with Stripe, check with\nthe platform or your developer to see if they prefer one or the other.\n- If you have existing payment data in your Stripe account, try to match the\ntype you’re already using:\n\n- `pm_`: Use the [Payment Methods\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment-methods) in conjunction with the\nPayment Intents API.\n- `card_`: Use the [Card API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/cards) in conjunction\nwith the Payment Intents API.\n- `src_`: You can still use the deprecated Sources API, but we recommend\n[migrating to the Payment Intents\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents/migration/charges) for\naccess to more features.\n\n## Default cards\n\nA *default card* is the primary card a customer sets or chooses for recurring\npayments, subscriptions, or as the default payment method for future\ntransactions. When you mark a card as `default`, it automatically becomes the\npayment method for the next transaction unless you specify otherwise. Use this\nfeature for subscription-based services that require automatic recurring\npayments. You can set a new card as the new default payment method, or add it as\nan additional payment method without changing the current default.\n\nTypeObject prefixMigration behaviorCard`card_`Sets a default card on import. If\nunspecified in the data file, the first card imported becomes the\ndefault.Payment Method`pm_`Doesn’t require a default card. If unspecified in the\ndata file, no card is the default.Source`src_`Doesn’t require a default card. If\nunspecified in the data file, no card is the default.\n### Provide default card data\n\n- Include default card information in a separate column of your data file,\nideally using `TRUE` and `FALSE` values to identify the default and non-default\ncards.\n- Marking a card as default during import overrides an existing customer’s\ncurrent default payment method, if set.\n\n## Current limitations\n\nStripe can’t migrate cards stored by digital wallets such as Google and Apple\nbecause those services (not the previous provider) tokenize the stored values\nfor security. You must add any cards associated with digital wallets as new\npayment methods in Stripe.\n\n## Address validation for Stripe Tax\n\nWhen you migrate customer data to an account using Stripe Tax, include customer\naddress fields for the following reasons:\n\n- **Tax calculation accuracy**: Addresses help calculate taxes correctly in\ndifferent jurisdictions.\n- **Compliance with tax laws**: Local tax laws require addresses for tax invoice\naccuracy.\n- **Audits and reporting**: Precise address data aids compliance in tax audits\nand enhances internal analytics by recording transaction locations.\n- **Enhanced customer checkout**: Starting with accurate addresses improves the\ncheckout process for repeat customers by enabling precise, automatic tax\ncalculation.\n- **Adaptability to tax law changes**: A full set of customer address data\nallows a business to adjust to tax regulation changes, preventing compliance\nissues.\n\n## Card Account Updater (CAU)\n\nFiles from processors often contain expired cards. Stripe’s Card Account Updater\n(CAU) automatically updates stored card information by retrieving and applying\nnew card details from the issuing bank.\n\nCAU maximizes continuity of service and improves authorization rates, but might\nincur fees for each updated card in your account. You can specify how we handle\nexpired cards during import.\n\n- **Skip expired cards**: Don’t import expired card data.\n#### Note\n\nCAU might still update non-expired cards (such as stolen or replacement cards),\ntriggering post-migration charges.\n- **Import expired cards**: Allow CAU to update as many cards as possible and\ncharge CAU fees to your account.\n\n### How it works\n\n![How card updating on import\nworks](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/dm-cau.376a7292d021463b18118595e4e20e79.jpg)\n\n## Migrate proof of Strong Customer Authentication (SCA)\n\nFor European users, PSD2 (Second Payment Services Directive) mandates [Strong\nCustomer Authentication\n(SCA)](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication) to enhance\nelectronic payment security. SCA requires two out of three independent\nauthentication factors for transactions:\n\n- Something the customer knows (such as a password)\n- Something the customer possesses (such as a mobile device)\n- Something the customer is (such as biometric data)\n\nNetwork transaction IDs from your previous processor show that a customer\nauthenticated a transaction using SCA with the previous processor, enabling\nStripe to apply for SCA exemptions for future transactions. This makes your\nmigration to Stripe seamless for your customers, removing their need to\nre-authenticate.\n\nIf your previous provider can’t supply transaction IDs, let us know in your\n[import request\nform](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/data-migrations/pan-import#request-migration)\nso we can offer alternative options.\n\n## 3DS mandate for Japanese Stripe accounts\n\nJapan’s revised [Credit Card Security\nGuidelines](https://www.meti.go.jp/press/2022/03/20230315001/20230315001.html)\nrequire Japanese businesses to enable 3D Secure 2 (3DS) by the end of March\n2025.\n\nIf you’re a Japanese business not using 3DS, report this in the **Additional\nDetails** section of the [migration request\nform](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/data-migrations/pan-import#request-migration).\nStripe adjusts our support and services to help you comply with industry\nstandards without disruption to your operations and security.\n\nLearn more about the [3DS Mandate in\nJapan](https://support.stripe.com/questions/3ds-mandate-in-japan).\n\n## Card file guidance\n\n- A processor can provide a number of different fields.\n- We advise your processor to provide a full export of all customer and payment\nmethod data to Stripe.\n- Stripe can filter out any unnecessary fields from the previous processor’s\ndata as needed.\n- Stripe can merge multiple received files if either the old customer ID or the\nold source ID is present in both files.\n\n### File formatting requirements\n\nExport data files must meet the following data standards for us to proceed with\nan import:\n\n- The file must be in CSV format.\n- The file must be UTF-8 encoded.\n- Delimit rows by a single newline character `\n` (not `\\r\n`).\n- Delimit columns by `,`.\n- You must wrap all fields containing commas in double quotes `\"`. We recommend\nwrapping all fields in double quotes.\n- Leave empty fields entirely empty (no character in between delimiters). You\nmust *not* denote a missing field with `NULL`, `N/A`, or any other value.\n- Escape any double quotes that are part of the content with another double\nquote per the CSV RFC. For example, format `William \"Bard of Avon\" Shakespeare`\nas `\"William \"\"Bard of Avon\"\" Shakespeare\"`.\n- Fields can’t contain newline characters (`\\r` or `\n`) within a field. Example of what to avoid: `101 1st Ave\nApt 1`\n- All rows must have the same number of columns.\n- Columns support any order.\n- You must encrypt sensitive data files with our [PGP\nkey](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/data-migrations/pan-import#migration-pgp-key)\nbefore submitting through SFTP.\n\n## Card data fields\n\nFieldRequiredAdditional infoOld customer IDRequiredWe create a customer ID for\neach unique old customer ID provided.Card numberRequiredEach customer imported\nmust have at least one Card.Card expiryRequiredYou can provide this option as\none or two (separate month and year values) columns.Network Transaction\nIDsRequired**Mandatory for [SCA impacted\nmerchants](https://support.stripe.com/questions/countries-in-the-european-economic-area-(eea)-impacted-by-strong-customer-authentication-(sca)-regulation).Address\nline 1Required**Recommended for address validation.
