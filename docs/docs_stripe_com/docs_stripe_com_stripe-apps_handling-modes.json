If a user installs your app into\ntest mode only, any applicable test mode events are sent to your test mode\nwebhook endpoints. If a user installs your app into both live mode and test\nmode, test mode events are sent to your test mode *and* live mode webhook\nendpoints and live mode events are sent only to your live mode webhook\nendpoints.\n\n#### Note\n\nWe recommend that you set up both live mode and test mode webhook endpoints to\nmake sure that both modes are properly supported. See [event\nbehavior](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/build-backend#event-behavior-depends-on-install-mode)\nfor more information and examples about how the install mode affects event\nbehavior.\n\n## OAuth test mode links\n\nOAuth apps initiate app installation from within their platform. The developer\nis responsible for implementing a test mode install link if you want test mode\nsupport. The Stripe Dashboard provides a test mode OAuth install link.\n\n![The location of public OAuth links within the Stripe\nDashboard](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/public-oauth-links.bef9bbbf32bcac8e16ff9515fc4169e4.png)\n\nThe Stripe Apps OAuth documentation has more information on [creating OAuth\ninstall\nlinks](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/api-authentication/oauth#create-install-link).\n\n## See also\n\n- [Webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks)\n- [Event destinations](https://docs.stripe.com/event-destinations)\n- [Server-side logic](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/build-backend)\n- [OAuth 2.0 API Authentication\nType](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/api-authentication/oauth)\n\n## Links\n\n- [listen to events for your installed users\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/events)\n- [event\nbehavior](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/build-backend#event-behavior-depends-on-install-mode)\n- [creating OAuth install\nlinks](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/api-authentication/oauth#create-install-link)\n- [Webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks)\n- [Event destinations](https://docs.stripe.com/event-destinations)\n- [Server-side logic](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/build-backend)\n- [OAuth 2.0 API Authentication\nType](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/api-authentication/oauth)",
