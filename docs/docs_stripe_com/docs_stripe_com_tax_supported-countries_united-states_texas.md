# Collect tax in Texas

## Learn how to use Stripe Tax to calculate, collect, and report tax in Texas.

## When to register for tax collection

See [Thresholds](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/thresholds) to get insights
about your potential tax registration obligations in Texas. Stripe also notifies
you with email and Dashboard alerts when you need to register to collect tax.
Learn more about how the [monitoring tool
works](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/monitoring).

Remote sellers must register to collect and remit tax in Texas when, in the
prior twelve months, they meet or exceed a sales threshold of 500,000 USD.

The threshold includes gross sales, including marketplace sales.

## Register to collect tax

Register for sales tax in Texas at the [tax
authority](https://comptroller.texas.gov/taxes/sales/). Read more about
registering for [sales tax in the US in our
guide](https://stripe.com/guides/sales-tax-registration-process-us).

Remote sellers with no physical presence in Texas can register for the [Single
Local Use Tax
rate](https://comptroller.texas.gov/taxes/sales/remote-sellers.php). This
election (the process of making your choice known to the state) allows you to
collect a single local use tax rate in the state. You can collect this tax rate
after notifying the [Texas
Comptroller](https://comptroller.texas.gov/taxes/sales/forms/index.php).

After you’ve registered to collect tax in Texas, go to
[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations?location=us-tx)
to add your registrations to Stripe in the Dashboard. This turns on tax
calculation and collection in Stripe for your transactions in Texas. You’ll be
able to indicate which tax election you made in Texas as part of adding your
registration to Stripe.

Learn [how to add your
registration](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/registering#track-your-registrations-in-the-tax-dashboard)
in the Dashboard.

## How we calculate taxes

If your [origin address](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/set-up#origin-address) is
in the US and differs from your customer’s state, Stripe always calculates tax
based on your customer’s location.

If your customer is in Texas and your origin address is also in Texas, Stripe
applies tax based on your origin address, depending on the type of product or
service you sell.

Stripe calculates the appropriate tax rate for your registration. If you
selected the Single Local Use Tax rate in Stripe then we will calculate and
collect the simplified rate. You can change this by [editing the tax
registration](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/registering#edit-a-registration) on
the **Dashboard**.

## Report and file your taxes

Stripe provides reports of your completed tax transactions. Go to
[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations) to access these
reports.

### Exports

The tax transaction data export provides a comprehensive and aggregated view of
transactions by location, including a breakdown of individual tax amounts. Learn
more about [tax reporting exports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports#exports).

### Location reports

[Location reports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports#us-location-reports)
offer a summary of transaction and refund data for specific US locations and
align with Texas filing requirements. You have the option to report on an
annual, quarterly, or monthly basis.

Reporting-specific considerations:

- If you chose to collect the Single Local Use Tax, you’ll see ‘Single Local
Tax’ on your report instead of any local jurisdictions.

### Filing

Stripe Tax has filing partners—Taxually, Marosa, and Hands-off Sales Tax
(HOST)—to help automate your tax filing. These partners automatically sync your
tax transaction data in real time, eliminating the need for manual data entry or
file transfers. Learn more about [tax
filing](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/filing).
