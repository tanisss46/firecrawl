  "content": "# Manage individual accounts\n\n## Use the Stripe Dashboard to manage connected accounts.\n\nYou can use the [Stripe\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/accounts/overview) to inspect,\nsupport, and better understand your platform’s [connected\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/accounts).\n\n## Create accounts\n\n#### Regional considerationsFrance\n\nPlatforms in France can’t create connected accounts in the Dashboard. Due to\nFrench regulations, you can only create connected accounts using Stripe-hosted\nonboarding.\n\nThis feature allows you to onboard connected accounts without writing code and\nto test before integrating. The user creating the account must be an\n[Administrator or\nDeveloper](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/teams/roles), and the\naccount must have a completed [platform\nprofile](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/settings/profile).\n\nTo create a new account, click the **+ Create** button on the [Connected\naccounts](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/accounts/overview) page, then\nselect the account type and country.\n\nFor Stripe Dashboard access, select\n[Express](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/express-dashboard) or\n[Standard](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/stripe-dashboard) to generate a\none-time link for the account holder to complete the onboarding flow. After the\naccount successfully connects, Stripe notifies you by email. Select\n[None](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\nto create the account immediately, then [complete\nonboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard/managing-individual-accounts#updating-accounts)\nit on the Account details page.\n\n![Create an account in the\nDashboard](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/create-account-unified.450b8fb21ed13bcc165baa7db225e157.png)\n\nCreate an account in the Dashboard\n\n## Find accounts\n\nTo find a specific connected account, you can [search in the\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/dashboard/search) using criteria such as its\nname, email, or\n[metadata](https://docs.stripe.com/dashboard/search#metadata-searches).\nAlternatively, you can [view a list of\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard/viewing-all-accounts) on the\n[Connected accounts](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/accounts/overview)\npage and click an account to open its Account details page.\n\nThe Activity section at the top of the Account details page can include an\n**Actions required** list. If the list appears, then you or the connected\naccount [must take\naction](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard/managing-individual-accounts#actions-required)\nto prevent or remove restrictions on the account’s capabilities. Such\nrestrictions can result from open onboarding, verification, or risk\nrequirements.\n\n![Connected account\nactivity](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/connected-account-detail-activity-actions-required.1fa550ba2083b188f24dab6ffaf29864.png)\n\n#### Note\n\nStripe puts some verifications on hold for accounts that haven’t had activity in\nthe last 540 days. [Learn more about reviewing inactive\naccounts](https://support.stripe.com/questions/2023-2024-us-verification-requirements-updates-for-custom-platforms-reviewing-connected-accounts#reviewing-inactive-accounts).\n\n## View the Dashboard as a connected account\n\n![View the Dashboard as a connected\naccount](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/view-dashboard-as.cc119a613c37b3d7c0b55750002c5a1b.png)\n\nView the Dashboard as a connected account\n\nTo view the Stripe Dashboard from the perspective of the connected account,\nclick the overflow menu () and select **View Dashboard As**. For connected\naccounts that don’t access the full Stripe Dashboard, such as Express and Custom\naccounts, you still see the full Stripe Dashboard. In those cases, what you see\nisn’t an exact representation of what the connected account sees. This feature\nworks by passing the connected account ID as the stripe-account-header on\nrequests made from the Stripe Dashboard, similar to [making API calls on behalf\nof connected\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/authentication#stripe-account-header).\n\n## View and unblock support cases\n\nView support cases your connected accounts have opened with Stripe and help\nunblock those cases by providing additional context.\n\nThe **Activity** section of a connected account’s details page contains a list\nof support cases raised by the connected account.\n\n![Support\ncases](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/connected-account-detail-support-cases.66690b126ed794b0f0c482eb8b6e79b8.png)\n\nYou can view support cases from the last 90 days created from any connected\naccount with access to either the full Stripe Dashboard or Express Dashboard.\nConnected accounts with Stripe Dashboard access who have the following\nexceptions are not included:\n\n- Connected accounts who are or have been connected to multiple platforms\n- Connected accounts who are also platform accounts\n- Connected accounts who have opted out of sharing their cases.\n\nClick on any conversation in the **Support Cases** section to open the support\ncase details page containing the detailed conversation between the connected\naccount and Stripe.\n\n![Send Stripe Support an\nemail](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/stripe-support-email.1d56ea6297510ab80f728b808e613972.png)\n\nYou can use the **Send Stripe Support an email** functionality for an existing\nsupport case to privately add any additional context that would help Stripe\nresolve the issue. These messages aren’t visible to the connected account.\n\n## Identify and remediate issues with required actions\n\nIf the account requires any action to prevent or remove restrictions, the action\nappears in the **Actions required** list at the top of the Account details page.\nEach list entry corresponds to a\n[requirement](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-requirements),\n[future_requirement](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-future_requirements),\nor information request from Stripe, and displays its due date and any\ncapabilities it can affect.\n\n![Connected account\nactivity](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/connected-account-detail-activity-actions-required.1fa550ba2083b188f24dab6ffaf29864.png)\n\nThe Due Date is the [current\ndeadline](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-requirements-current_deadline)\nof the corresponding requirement. The following table describes the action\nstatuses.\n\nWhen the list contains multiple actions, it orders them by priority. For\nexample, a past due requirement appears before a currently due requirement.\n\nRequirementIssue statusInformation request from StripeVarious`requirement` in\n`past_due`Past due`requirement` in `currently_due`Currently\ndue`future_requirement`Future requirement`requirement` in `eventually_due`Due\nlater\nClicking a requirement opens a requirement detail page with more information\nabout the requirement, including any errors and possible remediation paths. To\ntake action, click one of the paths.\n\nAvailable paths depend on the requirement and the account type. They can include\nsubmitting information on behalf of the account, sending the account a link that\nthey can use to submit information, or contacting Stripe Support.\n\n### Submit the information\n\nDepending on the issue type, this path opens a dialog or form where you can\nenter and submit the required information.\n\n### Send a remediation link\n\nThis path generates an account-specific remediation link that you can copy and\nsend to the account. The link takes them to a page where they can submit the\nrequired information.\n\nFor more information about remediation links, see the [remediation link process\nwalkthrough](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard/remediation-links).\n\n### Contact Support\n\nTo remediate some issues, you must contact Stripe. This path opens a pre-filled\nform that you can use to submit a ticket to Stripe Support.\n\n## Update account information\n\nThe capabilities of connected accounts change over time depending on their\nverification status. If your platform is responsible for [collecting updated\ninformation](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-controller-requirement_collection)\nfrom a connected account (including Custom accounts) when requirements change,\nyou can:\n\n- Update its account information, contact information, and business details in\nthe **Profile** section of the Account details page.\n- Update its [payout](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts) schedule in the\n**Overview** tab of the Activity section under **Account balances**.\n\n### Change the account representative\n\nYou can call the [Accounts API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/update) to\nchange the account representative. For more information, see the [required\nverification information\npage](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information#change-verification-info).\n\n### Managing business owners\n\nYou can add, edit, and remove business owners on the Account details page. To\nadd a new owner, click **+ Add owner**. To edit an existing owner, click the\noverflow menu ().\n\n### Update capabilities\n\nYou can manage an account’s\n[capabilities](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities) by clicking\n**Edit** in the **Capabilities** section.\n\n![Manage connected account\ncapabilities](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/edit-capabilities.59a5314539722cc15753c851fa2e1fda.png)\n\nManage connected account capabilities\n\n## Send funds\n\nFunds sent to connected accounts come from your platform’s balance. You can add\nadditional funds to your balance by clicking **Add to balance** in the\n**Balances** section.\n\nTo execute the transfer, go to your **Balances** section and click the\n**Transfers** tab. Click **New** to open the dialog for sending funds to\nconnected accounts.\n\nFor accounts where your platform is liable for negative balances (including\nCustom and Express accounts), you can send money directly to a connected\naccount’s bank or debit card. To send funds, a user must have at least\n[Administrator\nprivileges](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/teams/roles).\n\n## Pull funds\n\n#### Private preview\n\nPulling funds is a US-exclusive preview feature. Both the platform’s country and\nthe connected account’s country must be `US`.\n\nYou can pull funds from connected accounts using the **Pull funds** button in\nthe **Account balances** section.\n\n![Pull funds from a connected\naccount](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/pullfunds.91aed365ffb0bcc44510f00fa64d5761.png)\n\nPull funds from a connected account\n\nFor accounts where your platform is liable for negative balances (including\nCustom and Express accounts), you can pull money from a connected account’s\nStripe balance directly to your platform balance. Pulling funds is restricted to\nusers with at least [Administrator\nprivileges](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/teams/roles).\n\n## Remove accounts\n\n![Remove connected account from\nplatform](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/remove_account.2b00800b90522e6b2a46dd8827e1fa7b.png)\n\nRemove a connected account\n\nYou can remove and disconnect any connected account with access to the full\nStripe Dashboard from your platform. A removed account no longer appears in your\nconnected accounts list, and you can’t process payments or make API calls for\nit. You also lose any platform-controlled settings on the removed account, and\nthey aren’t reinstated if the account reconnects later.\n\nRemoving an account only disconnects it from your platform. It still functions\nas a normal Stripe account.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/accounts/overview)\n- [connected accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/accounts)\n- [Administrator or\nDeveloper](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/teams/roles)\n- [platform profile](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/settings/profile)\n- [Express](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/express-dashboard)\n- [Standard](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/stripe-dashboard)\n-\n[None](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n- [complete\nonboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard/managing-individual-accounts#updating-accounts)\n- [search in the Dashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/dashboard/search)\n- [metadata](https://docs.stripe.com/dashboard/search#metadata-searches)\n- [view a list of\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard/viewing-all-accounts)\n- [Learn more about reviewing inactive\naccounts](https://support.stripe.com/questions/2023-2024-us-verification-requirements-updates-for-custom-platforms-reviewing-connected-accounts#reviewing-inactive-accounts)\n- [making API calls on behalf of connected\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/authentication#stripe-account-header)\n-\n[requirement](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-requirements)\n-\n[future_requirement](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-future_requirements)\n- [current\ndeadline](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-requirements-current_deadline)\n- [remediation link process\nwalkthrough](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard/remediation-links)\n- [collecting updated\ninformation](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-controller-requirement_collection)\n- [payout](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts)\n- [Accounts API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/update)\n- [required verification information\npage](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information#change-verification-info)\n- [capabilities](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities)",
