# Charges now specify the ID for the dispute associated with a transaction, which can be expandedBreaking changes

## What’s new

Updates the `dispute` property on the `Charge` object to contain the ID of an
associated dispute. Previously, `dispute` contained the entire `Dispute` object.
You can [expand this property](https://docs.stripe.com/api#expanding_objects)
when retrieving charges to render the full `Dispute` object as before.

## Impact

This change simplifies the `Charge` object by replacing the full `Dispute`
object with just its ID in the dispute property. You can now access the full
dispute details by expanding the property when retrieving charges, giving you
more control over data retrieval.
