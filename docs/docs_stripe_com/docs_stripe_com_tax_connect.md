# Use Stripe Tax with Connect

## Understand how Stripe Tax can help your platform and your connected accounts comply with tax obligations.

Stripe Tax supports [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect) by helping you
calculate and collect taxes. It provides transactional reports to help with tax
reporting and filing for your platform or your connected accounts.

The first step for using Stripe Tax with Connect requires you to **determine
which entity has the obligation to collect and report taxes**. The entity that’s
liable for tax might be you or your connected account, depending on your
business model, regulations (for example, [marketplace laws in the US and
EU](https://stripe.com/en-nl/guides/guide-to-sales-tax-and-vat-for-marketplace-sellers)),
or the transaction details, such as the order amount or the type of goods being
sold.

## Use cases

Stripe Tax is designed to support different multi-party use cases:

Use caseUse whenExamples[Tax for software
platforms](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-for-platforms)- You’re a SaaS
platform that enables other businesses with software services to reach their
customers.
- Your *connected accounts* assume responsibility for collecting and remitting
taxes.
- An e-commerce platform like Shopify or Squarespace that enables businesses to
build their own online stores to sell directly to customers.
[Tax for marketplaces](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-for-marketplaces)- You’re
a marketplace that connects buyers and sellers on a single platform, typically
through websites or apps where products are listed by various third-party
vendors.
- Your *platform* assumes responsibility for collecting and remitting taxes.
- An e-commerce marketplace like Etsy or Amazon that allows a single shopping
cart for goods sold by multiple businesses.

[Stripe Connect’s distinction between SaaS platforms and
marketplaces](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/how-connect-works#use-cases)
doesn’t strictly correspond to the tax definition of marketplaces that are
responsible for tax collection. Consult with a tax advisor who understands your
business model to determine the tax obligations for both your platform and your
connected accounts.
