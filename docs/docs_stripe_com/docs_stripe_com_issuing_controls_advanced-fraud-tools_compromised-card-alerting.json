You can use these indicators\nto initiate communications and a reissuance workflow for cardholders. If Stripe\nobserves that a card has been successfully used in a card testing attack, we\nflag the card as compromised.\n\n## Mitigate risk and take action\n\nWhen Stripe observes a successful authorization during a severe card testing\nattack (defined as a `risk_assessment.card_testing_risk.risk_level` of\n`elevated` or `highest`), the card’s `fraud_warning.type` field will have a\nvalue of `card_testing_exposure`. The `started_at` value corresponds to the date\nthat the successful authorization in card testing attack took place. This value\nwon’t update if the card is compromised again in a later attack.\n\nAfter Stripe sets the `type` field to `card_testing_exposure`, we recommend\ncontacting the cardholder, canceling the card, and issuing a new one. This\nmitigates the risk of subsequent authorizations on what a fraudulent actor\nlikely assumes is a valid PAN that they can use.\n\nLearn more about [compromised card\nalerting](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/object#issuing_card_object-fraud_warning)\n\nCompromised card alerting is currently limited to beta users.
