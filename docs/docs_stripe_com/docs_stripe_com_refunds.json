  "content": "# Refund and cancel payments\n\n## Learn how to cancel or refund a payment.\n\nYou can [cancel a payment](https://docs.stripe.com/refunds#cancel-payment)\nbefore it’s completed at no cost. Or you can refund all or part of a payment\nafter it succeeds, which might incur a fee. Check out our [pricing\npage](https://stripe.com/pricing/local-payment-methods) for more information.\n\nRefunds use your available Stripe balance (not including pending amounts). If\nyour available balance doesn’t cover the amount of the refund, Stripe holds the\nrefund as pending until your Stripe balance becomes sufficient. You can resolve\na negative Stripe balance by collecting payments or topping up your account\nbalance. In regions where applicable, Stripe might debit your bank accounts\nautomatically to recover a negative Stripe balance.\n\n## Refund requests\n\nWe submit refund requests to your customer’s bank or card issuer. Successful\nrefunds appear on the bank statement of your customers in real time, depending\non the card network and issuing bank. Disputes and chargebacks aren’t possible\non credit card charges that are fully refunded.\n\nIf all of the following conditions apply, we send an email to your customer\nnotifying them of the refund:\n\n- The original charge was created on a customer in your Stripe account.\n- The customer has a stored email address.\n- You enabled **Email customers for refunds** in the\n[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/emails).\n\nYou can [view your refunded payments in the\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payments?status%5B0%5D=refunded&status%5B1%5D=refund_pending&status%5B2%5D=partially_refunded).\n\n## Issue refunds\n\nYou can issue refunds by using the [Refunds\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api/refunds) or the\n[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payments). You can issue more than\none refund against a charge, but you can’t refund a total greater than the\noriginal charge amount.\n\nDashboardAPI\nTo refund a payment using the Dashboard:\n\n- Find the payment you want to refund in the\n[Payments](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments) page.\n- Click the overflow menu () to the right of the payment, then select **Refund\npayment**.\n- By default, you’ll issue a full refund. For a partial refund, enter a\ndifferent refund amount.\n- Select a reason for the refund. If you select **Other**, you must add a note\nthat explains the reason for the refund. Click **Refund**.\n\nAlternatively, you can click on a specific payment and issue a refund from its\ndetails page. You can also send [refund\nreceipts](https://docs.stripe.com/receipts#refund-receipts) automatically or\nmanually send a receipt for each refund.\n\n#### Bulk refunds\n\nThe Dashboard supports the bulk refunding of full payments. Select what payments\nyou want to refund by checking the box to the left of each payment—even over\nmultiple pages of results. Then, click **Refund** and select a reason. You can\nonly issue full refunds in this way; partial refunds must be issued\nindividually.\n\n## Refund destinations\n\nRefunds can only be sent back to the original payment method used in a charge.\nYou can’t send a refund to a different destination, such as another card or bank\naccount.\n\nRefunds to expired or canceled cards are handled by the customer’s card issuer\nand, in most cases, credited to the customer’s replacement card. If no\nreplacement exists, the card issuer usually delivers the refund to the customer\nusing an alternate method (for example, check or bank account deposit). In rare\ncases, a refund back to a card might\n[fail](https://docs.stripe.com/refunds#failed-refunds).\n\nFor other payment methods, like\n[ACH](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ach-direct-debit) and\n[iDEAL](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ideal), refund handling varies from\nbank to bank. If a customer has closed their method of payment, the bank might\nreturn the refund to us—at which point it’s marked as\n[failed](https://docs.stripe.com/refunds#failed-refunds).\n\n## Handle failed refunds\n\nA refund can fail if the customer’s bank or card issuer can’t process it. For\nexample, a closed bank account or a problem with the card can cause a refund to\nfail. When this happens, the bank returns the refunded amount to us and we add\nit back to your Stripe account balance. This process can take up to 30 days from\nthe post date.\n\nWhen using the API, a [Refund](https://docs.stripe.com/api#refund_object)\nobject’s status transitions to `failed` and includes these attributes:\n\n- `failure_balance_transaction`: The ID of the [balance\ntransaction](https://docs.stripe.com/api#balance_transaction_object)\nrepresenting the amount returned to your Stripe balance.\n- `failure_reason`: The reason why the refund failed. These reasons\ninclude:Failure reasonDescription`charge_for_pending_refund_disputed`A customer\ndisputed the charge while the refund is pending. In this case, we recommend\n[accepting or challenging](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/responding#decide)\nthe dispute instead of refunding to avoid duplicate reimbursements to the\ncustomer.`declined`Refund declined by our financial\npartners.`expired_or_canceled_card`Payment method is canceled by a customer or\nexpired by the partner.`insufficient_funds`Refund is pending due to insufficient\nfunds and has crossed the pending refund expiry\nwindow.`lost_or_stolen_card`Refund has failed due to loss or theft of the\noriginal card.`merchant_request`Refund failed upon the business’s\nrequest.`unknown`Refund has failed due to an unknown reason.\n\nFor some payment methods, the decline code provided by our financial partners,\nwhich indicates the reason the refund failed, is available in the\n`network_decline_code` field of the `destination_details` hash:\n\n```\n{\n id: \"pyr_1234\",\n destination_details: {\n blik: {\n network_decline_code: \"decline_code\"\n },\n type: 'blik',\n }\n}\n\n```\n\nIn the rare instance that a refund fails, we notify you using the\n`refund.failed` [event](https://docs.stripe.com/event-destinations) (see [all\nrefund-related events](https://docs.stripe.com/refunds#refund-events)). If this\noccurs, you need to arrange an alternative way to provide your customer with a\nrefund.\n\nIf your platform uses [Connect with destination\ncharges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges#issue-refunds),\nfunds from a failed refund deposit to your platform account’s Stripe balance.\n\n## Cancel a refund\n\nDepending on the type of refund, you might be able to cancel a refund before it\nreaches the customer. Some card refunds support cancellation for a short period\nof time. The refund must not have been processed as a charge reversal. Only\nDashboard cancellations are currently supported for card refunds.\n\nFor some [payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bank-transfers#refunds), Stripe\nreaches out to the customer to collect banking information before processing the\nrefund. You can cancel these refunds while banking information hasn’t been\ncollected. Both the API and Dashboard cancellations are supported for this type\nof refund.\n\nCanceled refunds transit to a `canceled` status. As cancellations are a type of\nrefund failure, the attributes `failure_reason` and\n`failure_balance_transaction` are included on the\n[Refund](https://docs.stripe.com/api#refund_object).\n\nIf your platform uses [Connect with destination\ncharges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges#issue-refunds),\nfunds from a cancelled refund deposit to your platform account’s Stripe balance.\n\nDashboardAPI\nTo cancel a refund using the Dashboard:\n\n- Find the payment associated with the refund in the\n[Payments](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments) page.\n- Click the overflow menu () to the right of the payment, then select **Cancel\nrefund**.\n- If there are multiple partial refunds, select the correct refund in the\ndropdown.\n- Confirm the refund cancellation by selecting **Yes, cancel refund**.\n\nAlternatively, you can click a specific payment and cancel the refund from its\ndetails page.\n\n## Refund and reversal\n\nSome refunds—those issued shortly after the original charge—appear in the form\nof a reversal instead of a refund. In the case of a reversal, the original\ncharge drops off the customer’s statement, and a separate credit isn’t issued.\n\n[IC+](https://support.stripe.com/questions/understanding-blended-interchange-pricing)\nusers might see a difference in cost between reversals and refunds because\nreversals usually incur lower network fees.\n\nDashboardAPI\nTo verify if a refund goes through as a reversal on the Dashboard:\n\n- Open the payment details page of the payment associated with the refund.\n- In the Timeline, click **View Details** on the refund entry.\n- If it’s a reversal, a corresponding message displays.\n\n## Trace a refund\n\nAfter you initiate a refund, Stripe submits refund requests to your customer’s\nbank or card issuer. Your customer sees the refund as a credit approximately\n5-10 business days later, depending upon the bank. A customer might contact you\nif they don’t see the refund. A refund might not be visible to the customer for\nseveral reasons:\n\n- Refunds issued shortly after the original charge appear in the form of a\nreversal instead of a refund. In the case of a reversal, the original charge\ndrops off the customer’s statement, and a separate credit isn’t issued.\n- Refunds can fail if the customer’s bank or card issuer has been unable to\nprocess it correctly. The bank returns the refunded amount to us and we add it\nback to your Stripe account balance. This process can take up to 30 days from\nrequesting the refund.\n\nIf a customer is asking about a refund, it can be helpful to give them the\nprimary reference number corresponding to the refund. For card refunds, it can\nbe an **Acquirer Reference Number (ARN)**, **System Trace Audit Number (STAN)**,\nor **Retrieval Reference Number (RRN)**. An ARN, STAN, or RRN is a reference\nnumber assigned to a card transaction as it moves through the payment flow. For\nlocal payment method refunds, it can be a reference number generated by Stripe\nor our financial partners which is propagated to the beneficiary banks or\ninstitutions. Your customer can then take this reference to their bank, which\ncan provide more information about when the refund is available. Having a\nreference number can also increase your customer’s confidence that the refund\nhas been initiated.\n\nRefund references are available under the following conditions:\n\n- They’re supported for some financial partners, and marked as unavailable\notherwise.\n- It takes up to 7 business days after initiating the refund to receive the ARN\nfrom downstream banking partners.\n- An ARN isn’t available in the case of a reversal, since the original charge\nisn’t processed. For card networks that don’t support ARNs, we attempt to\nprovide other references such as System Trace Audit Number (STAN) or Retrieval\nReference Number (RRN).\nDashboardAPI\nTo find the reference of a refund using the Dashboard:\n\n- Open the payment details page of the payment associated with the refund.\n- In the Timeline, click **View Details** on the refund entry.\n- Where available, Stripe shows the ARN or STAN on the clipboard.\n\n## Cancel a payment\n\nYou can cancel a payment using the Dashboard only when its status is\n`uncaptured`. To cancel a payment with other statuses, you must use the API.\n\nDashboardAPI\nTo cancel uncaptured payments using the Dashboard:\n\n- Find the payment you want to cancel in the\n[Payments](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments) page.\n- Click the overflow menu () to the right of the payment, then select **Cancel\npayment**.\n- Select a reason for canceling, and click **Yes**. If you select **Other**, you\nmust add a note that explains the reason for canceling the payment.\n\n## Refund events\n\nStripe triggers [events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events#events) every time a\nrefund is created or changed. Some other actions, like reviews closing, also\ntrigger events that are relevant to refunds.\n\nMake sure that your integration is set up to [handle\nevents](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/handling-payment-events). You must also\nbuild internal logic for notifying customers or your team about the state of the\nrefund process. At a minimum, Stripe recommends that you listen for the\n`refund.created` event.\n\nThe following table describes the most common events related to refunds.\n\nEventDescription`refund.created`Sent when a refund is\ncreated.`refund.updated`Sent when the refund is updated. Updates include adding\nmetadata and providing details like the [ARN as a reference number to trace\nrefunds](https://docs.stripe.com/refunds#tracing-refunds).`refund.failed`Sent\nwhen a [refund has\nfailed](https://docs.stripe.com/refunds#failed-refunds).`charge.dispute.funds_reinstated`Sent\nwhen funds are reinstated to your account after a dispute is closed, including\n[partially refunded\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/best-practices#partial-refund-bp).`charge.refunded`Sent\nwhen a charge is refunded, including partial refunds. Listen to `refund.created`\nfor information about the refund.`review.closed`Sent when a\n[review](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#review_object) is closed. See\nthe `reason` field to understand why it was closed, one of: `approved`,\n`disputed`, `refunded`, or\n`refunded_as_fraud`.`source.refund_attributes_required` DeprecatedSent when the\nreceiver source requires refund attributes to process a refund or a\nmispayment.`charge.refund.updated` DeprecatedSent when the refund is updated,\nonly for refunds with a corresponding charge. Listen to `refund.updated` for\nupdates on all refunds instead.\n## Cost optimization\n\nIf your business processes a large volume of refunds close to the time of\ntransaction, we recommend using [manual authorization and\ncapture](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/place-a-hold-on-a-payment-method) to\nreduce your refund costs. Manual authorization and capture lets you better\ncontrol costs by canceling payments before they’re captured, or by reducing your\ncaptured amount rather than processing a refund.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Add funds to your Stripe\nbalance](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/add-funds)\n- [Add funds to your platform balance](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/top-ups)\n- [Currency conversion](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies/conversions)\n\n## Links\n\n- [cancel a payment](https://docs.stripe.com/refunds#cancel-payment)\n- [pricing page](https://stripe.com/pricing/local-payment-methods)\n- [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/emails)\n- [view your refunded payments in the\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payments?status%5B0%5D=refunded&status%5B1%5D=refund_pending&status%5B2%5D=partially_refunded)\n- [Refunds API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/refunds)\n- [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payments)\n- [Payments](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments)\n- [refund receipts](https://docs.stripe.com/receipts#refund-receipts)\n- [ACH](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ach-direct-debit)\n- [iDEAL](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ideal)\n- [Refund](https://docs.stripe.com/api#refund_object)\n- [balance transaction](https://docs.stripe.com/api#balance_transaction_object)\n- [accepting or challenging](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/responding#decide)\n- [event](https://docs.stripe.com/event-destinations)\n- [Connect with destination\ncharges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges#issue-refunds)\n- [payment methods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bank-transfers#refunds)\n-\n[IC+](https://support.stripe.com/questions/understanding-blended-interchange-pricing)\n- [events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events#events)\n- [handle events](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/handling-payment-events)\n- [partially refunded\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/best-practices#partial-refund-bp)\n- [review](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#review_object)\n- [manual authorization and\ncapture](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/place-a-hold-on-a-payment-method)\n- [Add funds to your Stripe\nbalance](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/add-funds)\n- [Add funds to your platform balance](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/top-ups)\n- [Currency conversion](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies/conversions)",
