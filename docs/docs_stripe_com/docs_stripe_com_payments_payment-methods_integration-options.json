Use this guide to make sure your chosen payment methods work for your\nbusiness and to determine how you want to add payment methods. See [payment\nmethod\nsupport](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/payment-method-support)\nto learn which countries, currencies, products, and APIs support which payment\nmethods.\n\n## Choose your integration\n\nThe table below describes several of the ways you can get started with your\nintegration, including no-code, low-code, and advanced integration paths. You\ncan also compare [payment scenario\nsupport](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/online-payments#compare-payment-scenario-support),\n[features](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/online-payments#compare-features),\nand [product\nsupport](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/online-payments#compare-product-support).\n\nIn addition to the paths described below, you can use [Stripe\nInvoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing) to automatically charge your\ncustomer’s saved payment method or email invoices [without writing any\ncode](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/no-code-guide).

Make sure your chosen payment methods work for your scenario by\nreviewing the [Payment method\nsupport](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/payment-method-support)\npage.\n\n## Add payment methods\n\nYour customers see the available payment methods during the checkout process.\nYou can either manage payment methods from the\n[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) or list\npayment methods manually in code. See the [Accept a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment) guide for detailed\nsteps.\n\n### Use dynamic payment methods\n\nStripe dynamically displays the most relevant payment methods to your customers\nbased on the payment method preferences you set in the Dashboard and eligibility\nfactors such as transaction amount, currency, and payment flow. To enable and\nmanage your payment method preferences, go to the\n[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods). Stripe\nenables certain payment methods for you by default and might enable additional\npayment methods after notifying you.\n\nUnless you have to list payment methods manually, we recommend using dynamic\npayment methods. Dynamic payment methods automatically determines whether to\ndisplay payment methods according to set rules.\n\nSee [Dynamic payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/dynamic-payment-methods)\nto learn more.\n\n### Manually list payment methods\n\nListing payment methods manually requires some coding. Every payment method you\nwant your PaymentIntent to accept must be added to `payment_method_types`.\nUnless your integration requires that you list payment methods manually, we\nrecommend that you manage payment methods from the\n[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods). Stripe\nhandles the return of eligible payment methods based on factors such as the\ntransaction’s amount, currency, and payment flow.\n\nCheckoutPayment Element\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/checkout/sessions \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d mode=payment \\\n -d \"line_items[0][price]\"={{PRICE_ID}} \\\n -d \"line_items[0][quantity]\"=2 \\\n --data-urlencode success_url=\"https://example.com/success\" \\\n -d \"payment_method_types[0]\"=bancontact \\\n -d \"payment_method_types[1]\"=card \\\n -d \"payment_method_types[2]\"=eps \\\n -d \"payment_method_types[3]\"=ideal \\\n -d \"payment_method_types[4]\"=p24 \\\n -d \"payment_method_types[5]\"=sepa_debit\n```\n\nIf multiple payment methods are passed, Checkout dynamically reorders them to\nprioritize the most relevant payment methods based on the customer’s location\nand other characteristics. The payments acceptance page prioritizes showing\npayment methods known to increase conversion for your customer’s location while\nlower priority payment methods are hidden in an overflow menu.\n\n## Links\n\n- [payment method\nsupport](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/payment-method-support)\n- [payment scenario\nsupport](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/online-payments#compare-payment-scenario-support)\n- [features](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/online-payments#compare-features)\n- [product\nsupport](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/online-payments#compare-product-support)\n- [Stripe Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing)\n- [without writing any code](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/no-code-guide)\n- [payment methods supported by\nInvoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/payment-methods#supported)\n- [PAYMENT LINKS](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n- [STRIPE-HOSTED\nPAGE](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web&ui=stripe-hosted)\n- [EMBEDDED\nFORM](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web&ui=embedded-form)\n- [EMBEDDED COMPONENTS](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/custom/quickstart)\n- [ADVANCED\nINTEGRATION](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web&ui=elements)\n-\n[Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/how-checkout-works?payment-ui=stripe-hosted)\n-\n[Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/how-checkout-works?payment-ui=embedded-form)\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements)\n- [Checkout Sessions](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions)\n- [PaymentIntents](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents)\n- [custom domains](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/custom-domains)\n- [Appearance API](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/appearance-api)\n- [Dynamically\ndisplay](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/dynamic-payment-methods)\n- [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods)\n- [Faster checkout with Link](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link)\n- [Apple Pay](https://docs.stripe.com/apple-pay)\n- [Google Pay](https://docs.stripe.com/google-pay)\n- [Amazon Pay](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/amazon-pay)\n- [External payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/external-payment-methods)\n- [20 preset\nfonts](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/customization/appearance#font-compatibility)\n- [learn more about payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/overview)\n- [registering your\ndomain](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/pmd-registration)\n- [Accept a payment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment)\n- [https://example.com/success](https://example.com/success)",
