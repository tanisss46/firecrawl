  "content": "# Ending a subscription trial now uses the timestamp of that API requestBreaking changes\n\n## What’s new\n\nWhen ending a trial on a subscription using `trial_end=now`, the updated\nsubscription now receives a `trial_end` timestamp from the time of the request\nrather than being unset.\n\n## Impact\n\nProviding a precise `trial_end` timestamp when ending a subscription trial using\n`trial_end=now` lets you track exactly when a trial was ended. This improves\naccuracy in subscription lifecycle management, but might require updates to code\nthat processes trial end events.\n\n## Upgrade\n\n- [View your current API\nversion](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#view-your-api-version-and-the-latest-available-upgrade-in-workbench)\nin Workbench.\n- If you use an SDK, upgrade to the corresponding SDK version for this API\nversion.- If you don’t use an SDK, update your [API\nrequests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/versioning) to include `Stripe-Version:\n2018-07-27`\n- Upgrade the API version used for [webhook\nendpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks/versioning).\n- [Test your integration](https://docs.stripe.com/testing) against the new\nversion.\n- If you use Connect, [test your Connect\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/testing).\n- In Workbench, [perform the\nupgrade](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#perform-the-upgrade).
