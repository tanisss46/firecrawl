  "content": "# Set payment methods per-subscription\n\n## Learn how to specify which payment methods are available for a subscription.\n\nThe subscription\n[payment_settings](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-payment_settings)\nparameter lets you set specific payment methods on individual subscriptions.\nThis allows more flexibility than a single `default_payment_method` or less\ngranular customer settings.\n\nTo enable payment methods, you first need to activate them in your [account\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) in the Stripe\nDashboard.\n\nIn some situations, there might be restrictions that prevent certain payment\nmethods from being used for a subscription. For example, a payment method might\nonly operate in one currency, or have limitations on the amount that a customer\ncan pay. Stripe doesn’t automatically select a payment method if limitations\nprevent it from being used. Learn more about [payment method\nsupport](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/payment-method-support#product-support).\n\n## Manually select payment methods\n\nYou can override the payment methods that a customer can use to pay a\nsubscription by changing its [payment\nsettings](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-payment_settings).\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscriptions/sub_49ty4767H20z6a \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d \"payment_settings[payment_method_types][]\"=card \\\n -d \"payment_settings[payment_method_types][]\"=customer_balance\n```\n\nIf you configured a default payment method on either the\n[Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-invoice_settings-default_payment_method)\nor the\n[Subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-default_payment_method),\nbe sure to include it in the list of `payment_method_types`. Otherwise, that\nmethod won’t be used and payment might fail.\n\n## Payment method priority\n\nBy default, customers can pay a subscription’s generated\n[invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices) with any of the enabled payment\nmethods in your [Invoice default payment method\nconfiguration](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/invoice). This\ntakes precedence over the older\n[default_source](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-default_source)\ncustomer setting.\n\nIf set, a subscription’s `payment_settings.payment_method_types` takes priority\nover default invoice settings, but only for that specific subscription. Payment\nmethod types are passed onto the subscription’s [setup\nintent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents) and invoices.\n\nYou can further specify a subscription’s `default_payment_method`, or the older\n`default_source`, to prioritize which payment method is attempted.\n\n## Payment method errors\n\nPayment method errors can prevent a subscription from being created. This can\nhappen when:\n\n- You manually select a payment method but a restriction, such as supported\ncurrencies, prevents it from being used.\n- A payment method isn’t activated for your account\n\nErrors can also occur at time of payment, and Stripe can’t finalize the invoice.\nSee invoicing [payment method\nerrors](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/payment-methods#payment-method-errors)\nfor details.\n\n### Payment method options\n\nSome payment methods have additional options that you can set to customize how a\ncustomer pays. See the [payment method\noptions](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-payment_settings)\ndocumentation for details.\n\n## Links\n\n-\n[payment_settings](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-payment_settings)\n- [account settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods)\n- [payment method\nsupport](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/payment-method-support#product-support)\n-\n[Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-invoice_settings-default_payment_method)\n-\n[Subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-default_payment_method)\n- [invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n- [Invoice default payment method\nconfiguration](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/invoice)\n-\n[default_source](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-default_source)\n- [setup intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents)\n- [payment method\nerrors](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/payment-methods#payment-method-errors)",
