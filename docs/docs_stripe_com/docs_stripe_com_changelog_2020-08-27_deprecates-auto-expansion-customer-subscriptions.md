# Customer subscriptions are no longer auto-expanded by defaultBreaking changes

## What’s new

The `subscriptions` property on `Customers` is no longer included by default.

## Impact

Lets you optimize performance by not automatically including the `subscriptions`
property on the Customer object. You can still expand the list of subscriptions,
but Stripe recommends against it for performance reasons.
