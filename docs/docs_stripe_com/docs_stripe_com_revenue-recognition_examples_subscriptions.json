The 31 USD is recognized across 17 days in January and 14\ndays in February. If you looked at the summary after January ends, you might see\nsomething like:\n\nAccountJanRevenue+17.00DeferredRevenue+14.00\nThis means that recognized revenue increased by 17 USD for the days in January,\nand deferred revenue increased by 14 USD for revenue you expect to recognize in\nFebruary.\n\n## Annual subscription\n\nThis example uses the following assumptions:\n\n- On January 1, at 00:00:00 UTC, a customer starts an annual subscription that\ncosts 365 USD.\n- The subscription generates an invoice.\n- The invoice finalizes and the customer pays 365 USD.\n\nIn this example, the invoice and revenue periods are from January 1, 2019 to\nDecember 31, 2019. The 365 USD is recognized daily throughout the year. If you\nlooked at the summary after March ends, you might see something like:\n\nAccountJan 2019Feb 2019Mar\n2019Revenue+31.00+28.00+31.00DeferredRevenue+334.00-28.00-31.00\n## Monthly metered subscription\n\nThere are four types of\n[aggregate_usage](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/create#create_price-recurring-aggregate_usage),\neach of which has a different implication on how revenue is recognized.\n\n### Sum\n\nThis example uses the following assumptions:\n\n- On January 15, a customer subscribes to a monthly\n[metered](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models#usage-based-pricing)\nsubscription at 1 USD per unit, and with `aggregate_usage=sum`.\n- On January 25, they use 15 units.\n- On February 4, they use another 17 units.\n- On February 14, the subscription generates an invoice of 32 USD.\n- The invoice finalizes for 32 USD, but isn’t paid yet.\n\nIn this example, the invoice and revenue periods are from January 15, 2019 to\nFebruary 14, 2019. Although the invoice isn’t generated until February 14, the\n15 USD from January 25 still has to be recognized when the usage was reported.\nIf you looked at the summary after January ends, you might see something like:\n\nAccountJanRevenue+15.00UnbilledAccountsReceivable+15.00\nIf you looked at the summary after February ends and the invoice hasn’t been\npaid yet, you might see something like:\n\nAccountJanFebRevenue+15.00+17.00UnbilledAccountsReceivable+15.00-15.00AccountsReceivable+32.00\n### Max\n\nThis example uses the following assumptions:\n\n- On January 15, a customer subscribes to a monthly\n[metered](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models#usage-based-pricing)\nsubscription at 1 USD per unit, and with `aggregate_usage=max`.\n- On January 25, they use 17 units.\n- On February 4, they use another 15 units.\n- On February 14, the subscription generates an invoice of 17 USD.\n\nIn this example, the invoice and revenue periods are from January 15, 2019 to\nFebruary 14, 2019. If you looked at the summary after January ends, you might\nsee something like:\n\nAccountJanRevenue+17.00UnbilledAccountsReceivable+17.00\nIf you looked at the summary after February ends and the invoice is yet to be\npaid, you might see something like:\n\nAccountJanFebRevenue+17.00UnbilledAccountsReceivable+17.00-17.00AccountsReceivable+17.00\nThe 15 units recorded on February 4 don’t impact revenue recognition because\nthey’re not the max usage record.\n\n### Last during period\n\nThis example uses the following assumptions:\n\n- On January 15, a customer subscribes to a monthly\n[metered](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models#usage-based-pricing)\nsubscription at 1 USD per unit, and with `aggregate_usage=last_during_period`.\n- On January 25, they use 17 units.\n- On January 27, they use 10 units.\n- On February 4, they use another 15 units.\n- On February 14, the subscription generates an invoice of 15 USD.\n\nIn this example, the invoice and revenue periods are from January 15, 2019 to\nFebruary 14, 2019. If you looked at the summary after January ends, you might\nsee something like:\n\nAccountJanRevenue+10.00UnbilledAccountsReceivable+10.00\nThe 17 units recorded on January 25 doesn’t have any impact on revenue\nrecognition because it’s not the last usage record during the period at the end\nof Jan.\n\nIf you looked at the summary after February ends and the invoice hasn’t been\npaid yet, you might see something like:\n\nAccountJanFebRevenue+10.00+5.00 (-10.00 +\n15.00)UnbilledAccountsReceivable+10.00-10.00AccountsReceivable+15.00\nThe 17 units recorded on January 25 and 10 units recorded on January 27 don’t\nhave any impact on revenue recognition because they aren’t the last usage during\nthe period.\n\n### Last ever\n\nThis example uses the following assumptions:\n\n- On January 15, a customer subscribes to a monthly\n[metered](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models#usage-based-pricing)\nsubscription at 1 USD per unit, and with `aggregate_usage=last_ever`.\n- On January 25, they use 17 units.\n- On January 27, they use 10 units.\n- On February 4, they use another 15 units.\n- On February 8, they use another 18 units.\n- On February 14, the subscription generates an invoice of 18 USD.\n- On March 14, the subscription generates another invoice of 18 USD.\n\nIn this example, the invoice and revenue periods are from January 15, 2019 to\nFebruary 14, 2019. If you looked at the summary after January ends, you might\nsee something like:\n\nAccountJanRevenue+10.00UnbilledAccountsReceivable+10.00\nThe 10 units recorded on January 25 doesn’t have any impact on revenue\nrecognition because it’s not the last usage record at the end of Jan.\n\nIf you looked at the summary after February ends, you might see something like:\n\nAccountJanFebRevenue+10.00+8.00 (-10.00 +\n18.00)UnbilledAccountsReceivable+10.00-10.00AccountsReceivable+18.00\nNow in the period of February 14 to March 14, because there’s no usage record\nwithin the period, we recognize 18 USD when the invoice happens. If you looked\nat the summary after March ends, you might see something like:\n\nAccountJanFebMarRevenue+10.00+8.00 (-10.00 +\n18.00)+18.00UnbilledAccountsReceivable+10.00-10.00AccountsReceivable+18.00+18.00\n## Upgrade\n\nThis example uses the following assumptions:\n\n- On April 1, at 00:00 UTC, a customer starts a monthly subscription that costs\n90 USD.\n- The subscription generates an invoice.\n- The invoice finalizes on April 1 and the customer pays 90 USD.\n- On April 21 at 00:00 UTC, they upgrade to a monthly subscription that costs\n120 USD.- Two unbilled invoice items are created to represent (1) -30 USD for\nthe unused time of the previous plan and (2) 40 USD for the remaining time of\nthe new plan.\n- The next invoice includes the two unbilled invoice items and is finalized on\nMay 1, at 00:00:00 UTC with 3 line items:- -30 USD for the unused time of the\nprevious plan with the service period from April 21 at 00:00 UTC to May 1 at\n00:00 UTC.\n- 40 USD for the remaining time of the new plan with the service period from\nApril 21 at 00:00 UTC to May 1 at 00:00 UTC.\n- 120 USD for the service in May with the service period from May 1 at 00:00 UTC\nto June 1 at 00:00 UTC.\n\nIf you looked at the summary after May ends, you might see something like:\n\nAccountAprMayRevenue+100.00+120.00AccountsReceivable+90.00+130.00UnbilledAccountsReceivable+10.00-10.00\n## Downgrade\n\nThis example uses the following assumptions:\n\n- On April 1, at 00:00 UTC, a customer starts a monthly subscription that costs\n90 USD.\n- The subscription generates an invoice.\n- The invoice finalizes on April 1 and the customer pays 90 USD.\n- On April 21 at 00:00 UTC, they downgrade to a monthly subscription that costs\n30 USD.- Two unbilled invoice items are created to represent (1) -30 USD for the\nunused time of the previous plan and (2) 10 USD for the remaining time of the\nnew plan.\n- The next invoice includes the two unbilled invoice items and is finalized on\nMay 1, at 00:00:00 UTC with 3 line items:- -30 USD for the unused time of the\nprevious plan with the service period from April 21 at 00:00 UTC to May 1 at\n00:00 UTC.\n- 10 USD for the remaining time of the new plan with the service period from\nApril 21 at 00:00 UTC to May 1 at 00:00 UTC.\n- 30 USD for the service in May with the service period from May 1 at 00:00 UTC\nto June 1 at 00:00 UTC.\n\nIf you looked at the summary after May ends, you might see something like:\n\nAccountAprMayRevenue+70.00+30.00AccountsReceivable+90.00+10.00UnbilledAccountsReceivable-20.00+20.00\n\n## Links\n\n- [invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n-\n[aggregate_usage](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/create#create_price-recurring-aggregate_usage)\n-\n[metered](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models#usage-based-pricing)",
