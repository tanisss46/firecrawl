It’s their first interaction with your app, and it needs to be\nintuitive and polished, with minimal friction before they can start using your\napp.\n\nThe required onboarding steps are different for every app, but we provide tools\nand best practices to help you.\n\n## Design patterns\n\nView our [onboarding design\npatterns](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/patterns#onboarding) for common\nscenarios including activation, sign in, redirection, and so on.\n\n## Display your onboarding view\n\nWhen a user installs your app and goes to view it in the Dashboard, it’s\nimportant that the onboarding flow is the first thing they encounter. Make sure\nto:\n\n- Create an onboarding component (using\n[SignInView](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/components/signinview), if a\nsign in flow is needed).\n- In all of your [page-specific\nviews](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/reference/viewports#page-specific-availability),\ncheck to see if the user has completed onboarding when the view first loads, and\ndisplay your onboarding component appropriately. For example:\n```\nimport {SignInView, ContextView} from '@stripe/ui-extension-sdk/ui';\nimport appIcon from './icon.svg';\n\n// This component can be defined in a separate file for reuse between views\nconst Onboarding = () => (\n <SignInView\n description=\"Connect your SuperTodo account to Stripe.\"\n primaryAction={{label: 'Sign in', href: 'https://supertodo.example.com'}}\n brandColor=\"#635bff\"\n brandIcon={appIcon}\n />\n);\n\nconst CustomerDetailView = () => {\n // The definition of \"isSignedIn\" is dependent upon your app's sign in method\n if (!isSignedIn) {\n return <Onboarding />\n }\n\n return (\n <ContextView title=\"SuperTodo customer view\">\n // your signed-in content here\n </ContextView>\n );\n};\n```\n- Do the same in your [Dashboard default\nview](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/reference/viewports#dashboard-wide-availability).\nIf you don’t have a default view, create one so that wherever the user is in the\nDashboard, they’re presented with the right flow when they open your app. If you\ndon’t need a Default view for purposes other than onboarding, you can return\n`null` from the view if the user has already completed onboarding and the\nDashboard displays the Stripe Dashboard default drawer that guides users to a\npage-specific view. For example:\n```\nimport {SignInView} from '@stripe/ui-extension-sdk/ui';\nimport appIcon from './icon.svg';\n\n// This component can be defined in a separate file for reuse between views\nconst Onboarding = () => (\n <SignInView\n description=\"Connect your SuperTodo account to Stripe.\"\n primaryAction={{label: 'Sign in', href: 'https://supertodo.example.com'}}\n brandColor=\"#635bff\"\n brandIcon={appIcon}\n />\n);\n\nconst DashboardDefaultView = () => {\n // The definition of \"isSignedIn\" is dependent upon your app's sign in method\n if (!isSignedIn) {\n return <Onboarding />\n }\n\n return null;\n};\n```\n\n## Rely on Stripe authentication for zero-touch user onboarding\n\nIf you’re building an app that stores data in an external backend but doesn’t\nneed its own concept of user accounts, you can rely on Stripe’s authentication\nto offer zero-touch onboarding. Using this method, your app doesn’t require any\nonboarding and is usable immediately after installation.\n\nStart by setting up your backend to [authenticate requests from your app’s\nUI](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/build-backend#authenticate-ui-to-backend).\nWith that in place, you can store information in your database with an added\ncolumn for the user ID or account ID provided by Stripe. Users are already\nsigned into the Stripe Dashboard when they use your app, so there’s no need for\nadditional authentication.\n\n## See also\n\n- [SignInView](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/components/signinview)\n- [Add an app settings page](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/app-settings)\n\n## Links\n\n- [onboarding design\npatterns](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/patterns#onboarding)\n- [SignInView](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/components/signinview)\n- [page-specific\nviews](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/reference/viewports#page-specific-availability)\n- [Dashboard default\nview](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/reference/viewports#dashboard-wide-availability)\n- [authenticate requests from your app’s\nUI](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/build-backend#authenticate-ui-to-backend)\n- [Add an app settings page](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/app-settings)",
