In United Arab Emirates, Stripe Tax supports calculation and collection of VAT.

## When to register for tax collection

See [Thresholds](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/thresholds) to get insights
about your potential tax registration obligations in United Arab Emirates.
Stripe also notifies you with email and Dashboard alerts when you need to
register to collect tax. Learn more about how the [monitoring tool
works](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/monitoring).

If you’re located outside the UAE, you must register in the UAE as soon as you
perform taxable sales in the UAE and where no other person is obligated to pay
the due VAT on these supplies in the UAE (no reverse charge applies). The
registration deadline is within 30 days of performing the first taxable sale.

For example, if you’re based in the US and sell digital services to UAE
consumers, you must register within 30 days of performing the first sale.
However, if you only sell to UAE businesses, you don’t need to register because
such sales are subject to reverse charge.

- **Threshold**: 1 transaction
- **Included transactions**: Any taxable transactions that reverse charge
doesn’t apply to.
