# Orders that are paid or fulfilled, and then become canceled or returned, now automatically refund associated chargesBreaking changes

## What’s new

Updates the behavior of orders so that changing an order from `paid` or
`fulfilled` to `canceled` or `returned` automatically refunds the associated
charge. Previously, attempting to change an order from `paid` or `fulfilled` to
`canceled` or `returned` raised an error if the associated charge hadn’t already
been refunded.

## Impact

Changing the order status to `canceled` or `returned` now automatically refunds
the associated charge, streamlining order management.
