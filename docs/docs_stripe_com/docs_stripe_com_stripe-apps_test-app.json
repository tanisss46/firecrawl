  "content": "# Test your app externally\n\n## Set up and distribute test versions of your app before publication.\n\n#### Note\n\nExternal testing is currently only available for public apps.\n\nYou can set up an external test to enable other accounts to install your app\nbefore you publish and distribute a new version to the App Marketplace.\n\n## Before you begin\n\n- [Create your app](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/create-app).\n- Review the mandatory [App review\nrequirements](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/review-requirements).\n- [Upload your app](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/upload-install-app) in\ntest mode.\n- There is a limit of 25 testers per app. Limit the use of external tests for\ntesting purposes only.\n\n## Set up an external test\n\n- From the **Developer’s Dashboard > Apps**, select the app you want to test\nexternally.\n- Click the **External test** tab, then click **Get Started**.- If you don’t see\nthe **External test** tab, verify if you’ve selected public distribution from\n**Create a release**.\n- Complete the following fields to configure external testing (which you can\nedit at any time):- **Link access**: Choose whether anyone can install the app\nusing the link or to restrict to invited users only.\n- **Version**: Select a version for users to install. If you change the version,\nall current users will be updated to the new version.\n- Click the invite link to copy it, and send to users for them to install on\ntheir account. These users must have administrator rights to install the app.\n\nResult: After a user installs the test version of your app, all members of the\naccount can use it.\n\n![Set up test\napp](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/test-app-setup.b1dacf8f5ad162d1a72cb26162cbb12a.png)\n\nInviting users using the Dashboard\n\n## Update the version of your test app\n\n- From the **Developer’s Dashboard > Apps**, select the app you want to test\nexternally.\n- Click the **External test** tab, then click **Edit**.\n- Select a new version of your app from the dropdown, and click **Save**.\n\nResult: After you save, all test apps of current users will automatically update\nto the new version.\n\n## Evaluating your test app\n\nYou must inform your users that test apps are still in development and haven’t\nbeen reviewed by Stripe. Users should only install apps from developers they\ntrust.\n\n### Installing the test app\n\nAfter the tester opens the invite link, Stripe redirects them to the following\npage in the Stripe Dashboard:\n\n![Installation\ninvite](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/test-app-install.2d67f49c8cafcfb964c9d19ff7cf6d30.png)\n\nInstallation invite\n\nAfter the user installs the app, all members on the account can use it. If the\npublished version of the app is already installed on the account, it needs to be\nuninstalled before the test version can be installed.\n\n### Using the test app\n\nAfter installation, the app displays in the dock on the right side of the\nDashboard. After the tester opens the test app, there is a test version badge\nnext to the app name. They can hover over this badge to learn more about the app\nand the testing criteria.\n\n![Using test\napp](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/test-app-using.49c64bd7d77b4b76e26ebd6852b40485.png)\n\nTest app in dock\n\n### Leaving the test\n\nIf users no longer want to evaluate a test app, they must select it from\n**Settings > Installed Apps** and uninstall it. If the published version of the\napp was previously installed on the account, users can reinstall the app from\nthe App Marketplace.\n\n![Uninstall test\napp](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/test-app-uninstall.710b89177767cff3a7f53de749558d88.png)\n\nSettings page\n\n### Ending the test\n\nCurrently, we don’t support ending external testing with the Stripe Dashboard.\nInstead, to end a test of an app, you must upload a new version of the app to\ndisable the functionality. After this update, the new test version is available\nfor external testing.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Publish your app](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/publish-app)\n- [App review\nrequirements](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/review-requirements)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Create your app](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/create-app)\n- [App review\nrequirements](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/review-requirements)\n- [Upload your app](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/upload-install-app)\n- [Developer’s Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/developers)\n- [Apps](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apps)\n- [Settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/apps)\n- [Publish your app](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/publish-app)",
