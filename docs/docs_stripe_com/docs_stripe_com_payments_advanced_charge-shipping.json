Charge your customer for\nshipping using different Stripe products, some of which require coding. Before\nyou create a shipping rate, learn how to [collect billing and shipping\naddresses](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/advanced/collect-addresses).\n\n#### Third-party plugins\n\nIf you’re using a third-party application with Stripe (for example,\n[Thrivecart](https://support.thrivecart.com/help/setting-your-physical-fulfilment-shipping-options/)\nor\n[Shopify](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/shipping/setting-up-and-managing-your-shipping/setting-up-shipping-rates))\nand want to adjust the shipping rate, visit the docs for that service.\n\nStripe Elements doesn’t support calculating or defining shipping rates out of\nthe box. If you’re in need of this functionality, Stripe recommends building it\nyourself or using [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout).\n\nIf you choose to build this functionality yourself, you can include the shipping\ncost as part of the product price or total amount. This means factoring in the\nshipping cost when calculating the total price of the items in the cart or\norder. By doing so, the customer pays a single amount that includes both the\nproduct price and the shipping cost.\n\nHere’s a basic outline of the steps involved:\n\n- **Determine your shipping cost**: Decide on the shipping cost. Factor in\ndestination, weight, distance, or any other criteria applicable to your\nbusiness.\n- **Calculate the total amount**: Add the shipping cost to the price of the\nproducts to calculate the total amount.\n- **Integrate Stripe Elements**: Use Stripe Elements to create a checkout form\nto collect the customer’s payment information.\n- **Present the total amount**: Display the total amount, which includes the\nproduct price and the shipping cost, to the customer on the checkout page.\n- **Process the payment**: When the customer submits the payment information,\nhandle the payment processing in your server-side code.\n\n## Links\n\n- [collect billing and shipping\naddresses](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/advanced/collect-addresses)\n-\n[Thrivecart](https://support.thrivecart.com/help/setting-your-physical-fulfilment-shipping-options/)\n-\n[Shopify](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/shipping/setting-up-and-managing-your-shipping/setting-up-shipping-rates)\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout)",
