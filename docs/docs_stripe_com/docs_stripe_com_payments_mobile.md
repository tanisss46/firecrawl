# Stripe in-app Elements

## Build payments into your mobile app.

Use Stripe’s in-app Elements, a set of UI components, to build checkout flows in
your mobile app. Start building with the
[iOS](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios),
[Android](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-android), and [React
Native](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native) SDKs. You can customize
all the Elements to match the look and branding of your application.

## Mobile Payment Element

Accept payments using the Mobile Payment Element. Choose between two Payment
UIs: the Payment Sheet or the Embedded Element.

of payment methods on any screen in your

### Features

- [Access to over 100 global payment
methods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/overview) This
includes Apple Pay, Link, and other popular payment methods that are
automatically enabled.
- [Dynamic payment
methods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/dynamic-payment-methods)
Simplify your payment methods code by dynamically ordering and displaying
payment methods and [launch A/B
tests](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/a-b-testing) for new payment methods.
- [UI customizations to match your
app](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/appearance-api/mobile) Change the UI to
fit your app’s design. The layout stays consistent, but you can modify colors,
fonts, and more.
- [Address
collection](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/mobile/save-during-payment#collect-payment-details)
Collect complete or partial billing addresses with any payment method.
- [Save and display cards and bank
accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/mobile/accept-payment#enable-saved-cards)
Save, reuse, and manage cards and bank accounts. You can also [store a
customer’s payment details without an initial
payment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/mobile/set-up-future-payments).

## Other in-app Elements

Use the Element that best suits your use case. For example, use the Address
Element to collect shipping addresses or to collect billing addresses separately
from payment details.

Additionally, you can use the Customer Sheet to let your users manage their
payment methods on your app’s settings page. However, because the Customer Sheet
alone doesn’t support checkout flows, you must also use the Mobile Payment
Element to process payments.
