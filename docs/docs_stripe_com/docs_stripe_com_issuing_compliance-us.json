  "content": "# Issuing product marketing, design, and compliance guidelines\n\n## Learn how to keep your Issuing program and marketing campaigns compliant.\n\n#### Legal Disclaimer\n\nDon’t consider any of the information in this guide as legal advice. If you use\nStripe Treasury and Stripe Issuing, consult your own legal counsel for advice\nabout product branding and using Stripe products to offer financial services.\n\nThis information applies to both Treasury and Issuing integrations. To offer and\npromote Treasury and Issuing products to your customers and connected accounts,\nyour marketing and user interfaces must adhere to the guidelines that we outline\nhere. These guidelines help you navigate the financial regulations that apply to\nStripe products. We’ve organized them into the following sections:\n\n- [Account\nmanagement](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/compliance-us#account-management)\n- [Required agreements and disclosures for\nIssuing](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/compliance-us#issuing-terms)\n- [Required agreements and disclosures for\nTreasury](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/compliance-us#treasury-terms)\n- [Required agreements and disclosures for fees, credits, and rewards\nprograms](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/compliance-us#fees-credits-rewards-terms)\n- [Customer communications and\ndocuments](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/compliance-us#customer-communications-and-documents)\n- [Going live and\nmarketing](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/compliance-us#going-live)\n- [Recordkeeping](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/compliance-us#recordkeeping)\n\nThe following table outlines the steps you must complete before onboarding your\nfirst connected accounts. If you need help, contact the Stripe Compliance team\nat [platform-compliance@stripe.com](mailto:platform-compliance@stripe.com).\n\nIf you make changes to any items in the table at a later date, you must submit a\nrequest to the Stripe Compliance team using the [Change Request\nForm](https://form.asana.com/?k=8K51UWmWhttehNFD5qBLdg&d=974470123217835).\n\nTopicChecklistProduct applicabilityApplication flowYour application flow:-\nIncludes bank disclosures\n- Includes required agreements\n- Required KYC fields\n- Approved by Stripe Compliance\nTreasury and IssuingFees and creditsYou’ve [submitted your planned fees and\ncredits to\nStripe](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/compliance#fees-credits-rewards-terms)Treasury\nand IssuingMarketing and user interfacesYour marketing materials, including your\nwebsite landing pages, dashboards, and support pages:- Are approved by Stripe\nCompliance (or align with messaging guidelines)\n- Include bank disclosures\nTreasury and IssuingCustomer service channelsYour customers can access your\ncustomer service channels and they can:- Submit complaints\n- Submit disputes\nTreasury and IssuingAccount statements (optional)If you choose to send account\nstatements, they must:- Be approved by Stripe Compliance\n- Include Bank disclosures and relevant contact information\nTreasuryReceiptsYou have a mechanism to send your customers Stripe-generated\nmoney transmission receiptsTreasury and IssuingRegulated customer noticesYou\nsend regulated customer notices to applicants and accountholders, and they’re\neither:- Sent by Stripe on your behalf\n- Sent by your platform with templates approved by Stripe Compliance\nIssuing Spend Card and Charge CardRecordkeepingYou have a mechanism to retain\ncopies of:- Customer consent to open accounts\n- Marketing materials and user interfaces\n- Customer communications, such as support emails\n- Account statements, if applicable\nTreasury and Issuing\n## Account management\n\nBefore you launch Treasury or Issuing, you must implement the proper internal\ncompliance controls. You also need to build the processes described in this\nsection into your various workflows, customer service, and product channels.\n\n### Complaints program guidance\n\nComplaints are any expression of dissatisfaction with a product, service,\npolicy, or employee related to Treasury or Issuing, except those expressions\nmade by employees of your company. Properly handling complaints is mandatory\nwhen offering financial services products. See the [Handling\ncomplaints](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/handling-complaints) guide for\ndetailed complaint management requirements.\n\n### Disputes and charge errors\n\nAs part of providing customer support, you might be notified of suspected\ndisputed charges, charge errors, or both. The two most common types of disputes\nor errors are:\n\n- You or your customer believe a charge is unauthorized\n- You or your customer see an error on an account statement\n\nIf these errors occur, submit the dispute through the Stripe Dashboard. Select\nthe relevant transactions and choose **Dispute**. Be prepared to provide Stripe\nwith specific information to investigate the dispute, such as:\n\n- Details about the authorized user\n- Details about the disputed charge amount\n- The transaction date\n- An explanation of why the disputed charge is an error or unauthorized\n\nYou must report any disputed charge or error immediately upon notification of\nit. Failure to do so might impact your financial liability. To avoid a sustained\nreduction to your available balance, you can pay the disputed charge while we\ndetermine the validity of the dispute. If Stripe deems the dispute valid, we\ncredit the disputed charge amount back to the appropriate account.\n\n### Application flow\n\nYour platform must provide for three main compliance requirement workflows:\n\n- Collection of required KYC information\n- Presentation of the required bank disclosure\n- Ensuring that your applicant reads and accepts the required legal agreements\n\n### Customer-facing dashboards\n\nIf your platform plans to allow connected accounts to store balances with\nmultiple Treasury bank partners, display balances separately within any\ndashboard user interface or servicing communications that disclose balances.\nProvide a specific disclosure for each individual balance, indicating which bank\nholds the balance. This ensures that the connected account is aware of their\npotential insurance limits at each bank.\n\n## Required agreements and disclosures for Issuing\n\nIf you’re a platform and you’re not using [Stripe-hosted\nonboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/hosted-onboarding), you must:\n\n- Present the following program-specific agreements and disclosures for your\nconnected accounts to accept when they open their account.\n- Provide connected accounts with ongoing access to these agreements.\n- Present each agreement separately. You can’t combine them into one agreement\nfor your cardholders to accept.\n\n*Connected Account Agreements and Disclosures.*\n\nYou must provide the following agreements to your connected accounts before they\ncan start using the Issuing Spend Card Program:\n\n- [Stripe Connected Account Agreement](https://stripe.com/legal/connect-account)\n- [Stripe Issuing Accountholder\nTerms](https://stripe.com/legal/issuing-accountholder)\n- **Issuing Bank Terms**- *Celtic Bank Users only:* [Issuing Bank Terms - Spend\nCard (Celtic Bank)](https://stripe.com/legal/celtic-spend-card)\n- *Cross River Bank Users only:* [Issuing Bank Terms - Spend Card (Cross River\nBank)](https://stripe.com/legal/issuing/crb-spend-card)\n- **Apple Pay Terms** (if enabled for your program)- [Apple Pay Accountholder\nTerms](https://stripe.com/issuing/celtic/apple-payment-platform-program-manager-customer-terms-and-conditions/legal#exhibit-c-pass-through-provisions)\n\nIn addition to the above agreements, you must provide the following disclosures\nto your connected accounts before they can start using the Issuing Spend Card\nProgram:\n\n- **Electronic Signature Consent**: You must include text near the “Issuing Bank\nTerms” link that states: “By clicking “submit application,” you agree to the\nIssuing Bank Terms, Stripe Connected Account Agreement, and Stripe Issuing\nAccountholder Terms, and you consent to electronic signatures as set forth in\nthe Issuing Bank Terms.”\n- **Commercial Financing Disclosure**: For Connected Accounts with a business\naddress in CA, NY, or UT, you must present one of the following disclosures:-\nFor platforms that don’t charge fees:- *Celtic Bank Users only:* [Commercial\nFinancing Disclosure (Celtic Bank) (no\nfee)](https://stripe.com/legal/issuing-offer-document)\n- *Cross River Bank Users only:* [Commercial Financing Disclosure (Cross River\nBank) (no fee)](https://stripe.com/legal/crb-issuing-offer-document)\n- For platforms that charge a $0.10 fee when creating cards for users:- *Celtic\nBank Users only:* [Commercial Financing Disclosure (Celtic Bank) (fee\nincluded)](https://stripe.com/legal/issuing-offer-document-fees)\n- *Cross River Bank Users only:* [Commercial Financing Disclosure (Cross River\nBank) (fee included)](https://stripe.com/legal/crb-issuing-offer-document-fees)\n- For platforms that charge fees other than a $0.10 fee when creating cards for\nusers:- If you charge fees beyond Stripe’s fee of 0.10 USD, you might be\nrequired to create your own commercial financing disclosure to present to your\nconnected accounts for creating virtual cards.

That helps make sure your user interfaces and marketing\nmaterials are compliant with financial regulations regarding fees or offer\ncredits, especially in the form of rewards programs. Use the [Change Request\nForm](https://form.asana.com/?k=8K51UWmWhttehNFD5qBLdg&d=974470123217835).\n\n## Customer communications and documents\n\nTo comply with applicable laws and regulations, you must send certain\ncommunications to both your applicants and accountholders upon certain trigger\nevents.\n\nTo learn about customer communication requirements when using Issuing and\nTreasury together, see [Issuing regulated customer\nnotices](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/compliance-us/issuing-regulated-customer-notices).\n\n### Statements\n\nProviding statements, while optional, is a best practice that allows your\nTreasury or Issuing customers to periodically check their transaction history.\nIf you send statements, make sure they contain the following information:\n\n- [Company] name and address.\n- Your company’s customer support contact number and website\n- Customer account number\n- Customer name and address\n- Required disclosures\n- Transaction history (including opening and closing balances for the statement\nperiod)\n- Fees and credits.\n- Information about how you resolve errors and complaints\n\n### Receipts\n\nOne of the most important ongoing obligations you have in overseeing your\nTreasury or Issuing program is providing your customers with money transmissions\nreceipts. Every regulated transaction your customers initiate generates a\ncompliant money transmission receipt URL that you must share with your customer.\nYou can provide these URL receipts in a few different ways, such as emailing\nthem or making them available in your customer’s Dashboard. See the [Regulatory\nreceipts\nguide](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/regulatory-receipts) for\nmore information on how to access hosted receipts. If you plan to charge your\nconnected account owners any fees, whether they’re transactional or monthly\nrecurring, include a description of the fee on the receipt so that they can\nreconcile it to corresponding transactions or monthly statements.\n\n## Going live and marketing\n\nThe following information pertains to marketing and releasing your Treasury or\nIssuing programs to the public.\n\n### General requirements for marketing your account offerings\n\nAny message or communication you provide to the public for financial products or\nservices they don’t currently use must be truthful and fair, and in the interest\nof your potential customers.\n\n### UDAP and correct messaging\n\nFederal regulation prohibits unfair and deceptive acts or practices (UDAP). To\navoid UDAP violations, you must think of the end user first when developing and\ndeploying any marketing materials.\n\nMake sure that marketing materials use clear messaging that fully explains\nproduct features, costs, benefits, and limitations. Don’t leave out key terms or\nfees, and don’t advertise product uses or features that aren’t true.\n\nDoDon’tOnly use statements about products that are true, accurate, and aligned\nwith how users engage with the products.Don’t leave out key information from\nmarketing content. If the information is likely to affect whether someone uses\nthe product, then it’s “key.\"If you make claims that require additional data to\nsupport them, or if an end user needs to know more details to know how a certain\nclaim is true, you must:- Provide documented evidence\n- Disclose that information\nMake exaggerated claims that are hard to prove. Don’t make absolute statements\nthat are disproved by a single exception. For example, “number 1,\" “every,\"\n“only,\" “all,\" “never,\" “always.\"Clearly explain all qualifying limitations and\nrequirements needed by end users to get the product or features that you’ve\nadvertised.Don’t advertise features or programs that only a few applicants\nactually qualify for.All disclosures must meet a “clear and conspicuous”\nstandard:- Font size must be large enough to read.\n- Font color must visibly contrast with the background.\n- Dynamic or video ads must have the disclosure on screen long enough to be\nread.\nDon’t make disclosures hard to read.Disclosures used to explain or modify a\nclaim must be tied to the claim they’re explaining.- Use a hyperlink directly\nlinking to the disclosure (or include the disclosure next to the claim in the\ncopy itself)\n- Use reference text or symbols (an asterisk, for example) directly after the\nclaim and before the disclosure language.\nDon’t bury disclosures in other non-key disclosures or footnotes.Disclose all\naccount fees, costs, benefits, and terms as part of onboarding before your end\nusers take out a product.Don’t advertise products as “free” if you’re charging\nfees.Make sure all images used are properly licensed and that you can document\nthis fact.Don’t use images, formatting, or copy that implies products are\nendorsed by, or affiliated with, government entities or celebrities.\n### Messaging guidelines\n\nUse the following suggested messaging guidelines to convey key aspects of\nIssuing, Treasury, or both programs. Stripe or our banking partners have\nvalidated (proven as true) this content, so you can confidently use this\nmessaging in user-facing materials.\n\n-\n[Issuing](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/compliance-us#issuing-messaging-guidelines)\n-\n[Treasury](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/compliance-us#treasury-messaging-guidelines)\n\nThe following tables include validated content you can provide in your marketing\ncampaigns. You can make non-substantive changes (for example, changing the\ndesign or infusing your brand’s voice) to the suggested messaging as long as the\nkey information remains the same. Any substantive deviations from these\nguidelines require you to submit marketing materials and get approval from\nStripe and our bank partners. Approvals might take up to 10 business days to\nprocess.\n\nYou’re responsible for training employees on these requirements if they engage\nin marketing or sales activities for your Treasury or Issuing program.\n\n#### Issuing messaging guidelines\n\nThe following table provides guidelines for you to follow when developing\nmessaging around your Issuing program.\n\nTopic categoryDoDon’t\nLogo and name usage\n\nYour card program name and your brand name must have equal status, as with plain\ntext: Widget balance® + Stripe.

An email is\ndeemed a commercial message, subject to the CAN-SPAM act, if the primary purpose\nof the email is to convey a commercial advertisement, or to promote a product or\nservice. A transactional email is an email sent to a customer that has a primary\npurpose relating to a particular transaction or relationship between you and the\ncustomer, such as a payment reminder. The CAN-SPAM Act imposes more rigorous\nrequirements on commercial email messages, as compared with transactional\nmessages. Transactional messages aren’t subject to most of the requirements of\nthe CAN-SPAM Act. If a message contains both transactional content and\ncommercial content, the CAN-SPAM Act commercial email requirements might apply,\nif the primary purpose of the message can be considered commercial.\n\nTo facilitate compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act, any employee or staff using or\nhaving access to your email systems and resources for marketing must adhere to\nthe following guidelines:\n\n- Misleading header information. Any email message, whether commercial or\ntransactional, must not contain:- False or misleading header information.\n- A “from” line that doesn’t accurately identify any person (individual or\nbusiness) who initiated the message.\n- Inaccurate or misleading identification of a protected computer used to\ninitiate the message for purposes of disguising its origin.\n- Deceptive subject headings. Any commercial email message must not contain\ndeceptive subject headings. For example, a deceptive subject heading is one that\nlikely misleads the recipient about a material fact regarding the message’s\ncontents or subject matter.\n- Opt-out mechanism. You must provide your customers with the ability to opt-out\nof receiving future commercial messages, and you must honor customer requests to\nopt-out within 10 days. You can’t require a user to pay a fee or provide\ninformation other than an email address to opt-out.\n- Advertisement identification. Any commercial email message must contain clear\nand conspicuous identification that the message is an advertisement or\nsolicitation.\n- Physical address disclosure. Any commercial email message must disclose a\nvalid physical address of the sender.\n\nFailure to comply with CAN-SPAM could result in large fines for each violation.\n\n### Testimonials\n\nIf you’re using testimonials or endorsements in advertising Stripe products to\nyour users, consider the following:\n\n- The person giving a testimonial must be a real person and a true, bona fide\nuser of the service or product they’re talking about.\n- You must obtain and keep their permission in writing to use their quote. You\nmust update that permission every 24 months.\n- Product benefits, costs, or features in any quotes must be verifiable and true\nto what most users can expect to get.\n- If you paid someone for their quote, or gave them anything of value, you must\nput a disclaimer near the quote stating this fact. This includes paid actors, if\ntheir scripting makes it sound like they’re giving a testimonial.\n\n### Prohibited advertising\n\nYou can’t advertise Issuing or Treasury in print, radio, TV, on the internet, or\nin any other format in a manner that promotes any unlawful activity or that\ncauses reputation concerns for Stripe or our bank partners.\n\n### Prohibition on international marketing\n\nTreasury isn’t available to users or merchants located outside the US, so limit\nall marketing for Treasury to US domestic audiences.\n\nFor Issuing, although you can ship cards to international addresses for\nUS-domiciled cardholders, you must not market the Issuing program\ninternationally or to persons outside of the United States. That includes\nadvertising or promoting Issuing through marketing channels such as social\nmedia, email, and paid search results. As with all other aspects of the Issuing\nprogram, your marketing activities must comply with card network rules.\n\n### Required marketing disclosures\n\nYour users must understand the role that Stripe’s bank partners play in offering\nand operating certain financial products—and in many cases, that they’re\nentering into a contractual relationship with these banks.
