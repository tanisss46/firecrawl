# Collect tax in South Africa

## Learn how to use Stripe Tax to calculate, collect, and report tax in South Africa.

In South Africa, Stripe Tax supports calculation and collection of
[VAT](https://www.sars.gov.za/types-of-tax/value-added-tax/) for remote sellers.
You must have no physical presence in the country to collect this tax on Stripe.

## When to register for tax collection

See [Thresholds](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/thresholds) to get insights
about your potential tax registration obligations in South Africa. Stripe also
notifies you with email and Dashboard alerts when you need to register to
collect tax. Learn more about how the [monitoring tool
works](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/monitoring).

A non-resident business supplying goods and services in South Africa becomes
liable to be registered if the total value of taxable sales is more than 1
million ZAR in a 12-month period, or is expected to exceed this amount. Where a
non-resident company is liable to register for VAT purposes, they must appoint a
VAT representative. The obligation to appoint a VAT representative doesn’t apply
to providers of digital services.

Non-residents supplying digital services from a place outside South Africa to
South African customers (both B2B and B2C) must register by the end of any month
if they exceed the threshold of 1 million ZAR in any consecutive 12-month period
and any two of the following three circumstances apply:

- The recipient of the services is a resident of South Africa
- The payment for the services originates from a bank registered under the Banks
Act 94 of 1990 (the Banks Act)
- The recipient of the services has a business, residential, or postal address
in South Africa

For example, if you’re based outside of South Africa and sell digital services
to consumers in South Africa and cross the threshold during any 12-month period
(from February of the past year to January of the current year, for example) you
must register by the end of the month that you crossed the threshold in.

- **Threshold**: 1 million ZAR
- **Period**: 12 months
- **Included transactions**: Any taxable transaction.
