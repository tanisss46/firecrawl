# Removes undocumented fuel fieldsBreaking changes

## What’s new

Removes the following undocumented fuel fields from the [Issuing
Transaction](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/transactions/object) resource
in favor of the `_decimal` equivalents:

- `purchase_details.fuel.unit_cost`
- `purchase_details.fuel.volume`

## Impact

Removes undocumented attributes of the `Transaction`
[object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/transactions/object), replacing
them with equivalent attributes in the form of `*_decimal`.
