The automation process also allows coupons, taxes, and custom\ninformation on the credit memo in NetSuite. You can learn more about how to\nissue credit notes in the\n[Dashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/dashboard/credit-notes) or using\nthe\n[API](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/programmatic-credit-notes).\n\n## Credit notes for open invoices\n\nAfter you finalize a Stripe invoice, you can’t [edit the amount\ndue](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/invoice-edits). If you need to change the\namount after invoice finalization, you can use a credit note. [Credit\nnotes](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/dashboard/credit-notes) are documents\nthat decrease the amount of an `open` or `paid` invoice, but don’t void or\nreplace the original invoice.\n\nWhen you apply a credit note to an open invoice, the connector creates a credit\nmemo in NetSuite and applies it to the invoice after it’s paid. The final\ninvoice in NetSuite includes the adjusted amount due. The connector waits to\napply the credit memo to prevent an irreconcilable state (voided invoice and\ncredit note) in Stripe, which NetSuite doesn’t support.\n\n## Credit notes for paid invoices\n\nWhen you apply a credit note to a paid invoice, the following occurs depending\non the action. You can apply credit notes in multiple ways simultaneously, and\nthe connector reflects the applications in NetSuite.\n\nActionDescriptionNetSuite statusCreate a refundRefund the invoice payment to the\ncustomer’s payment method.The connector creates a refund and credit memo and\napplies them to the payment and invoice.Link a refundLink an existing refund for\nthe invoice payment.The connector creates and applies a credit memo to the\ncustomer refund.Out-of-band creditCredit the invoice for an adjustment amount\nmade outside of Stripe.The connector creates a credit memo for you to manually\napply to a customer refund.Credit the customer balanceCredit the customer’s\ncredit balance, which automatically applies to their future invoices.The\nconnector creates a credit memo when the balance credit gets applied to a future\ninvoice.\n### Out-of-band payments\n\nOut-of-band refunds can occur if your customer pays an invoice outside of Stripe\n(for example, a check or cash) and then receives a credit note. The connector\ncreates an unapplied credit memo in NetSuite that you can manually apply to a\ncustomer refund. The credit memo indicates that the credit represents an\nout-of-band payment. This allows you to create queries to identify and resolve\nthese types of credit memos.\n\n### Customer balance credit notes\n\nIf you issue a credit note for an invoice that has a credit balance applied to\nit, you might see funds credited to a customer’s credit balance instead of their\noriginal payment method.\n\n## Credit notes for previous transactions\n\nIf you have a history of Stripe transactions that you want to exclude from\nNetSuite, your implementation partner can configure a start date for records to\nsync on your account. The connector won’t sync any records before this date,\nincluding credit notes, payments, refunds, chargebacks, invoices, or payouts.\n\nIf you need to issue a credit note for a transaction created before the record\nsync start date, you can do so manually:\n\n- Create the credit note in Stripe.\n- Manually create the credit memo in NetSuite and apply it to the same\ntransaction, invoice, or refund.\n- Manually reconcile the refund to the bank deposit. During the reconciliation\nprocess, the connector automatically skips the refund with the attached credit\nnote.\n\nAlternatively, you can post the credit notes to a single income account:\n\n- Create the credit note in Stripe.\n- The connector creates an entry on the deposit that represents the refund\nattached to the credit note. This entry isn’t tied to the original invoice, and\nthe credit memo isn’t created.\n\n## Credit notes and taxes\n\nIf you calculate tax and use credit notes, you must use the following connector\nrepresentation method: `Taxes as a separate line item`. Representing taxes on\nevery line item isn’t supported because of limitations in NetSuite that prevent\nsetting the tax rate on credit memo line items.\n\n## Data synced from credit notes to credit memos\n\nThe connector syncs credit notes to NetSuite with the credit note ID, creation\ndate, currency, and includes any notes in the memo field. The connector uses the\nNetSuite customer that’s associated with the Stripe customer to create the\ncredit memo. Any manual changes to the NetSuite customer can cause the credit\nmemo to fail.\n\n### Invoice line items\n\nThe connector maps invoice line items as follows:\n\n- **Product price**\n\n- If included on a credit note line item and linked to a NetSuite item, the\nconnector uses that item on the credit memo.\n- If the product price isn’t linked to a NetSuite item, the connector creates an\nitem for the price or uses the generic line item called `Stripe Unallocated\nInvoice Item`.\n- **Description**\n\n- If present on the credit note line item, the connector adds it to the credit\nmemo line item description.\n- If the description is empty, the connector uses the invoice line item\ndescription.\n- **Quantity**: The connector maps the quantity, start date, and end date for\nrevenue recognition calculations.\n- **Amount**: The connector syncs the amount specified on the line item.\n- **Discounts**: The connector syncs any discounts specified on the line item.\n\nFor UK businesses that use the gross amount in NetSuite, the connector uses that\nfield for the credit memo. If you don’t use the gross amount, the connector uses\nthe amount field.\n\n### Custom line items\n\nYou can add a custom line to a credit note that isn’t associated with a specific\nplan or item. The connector creates an item called `Stripe Custom Credit Note\nLine Item` and maps the custom line to this NetSuite item. The description and\namount map to the NetSuite credit memo line. The connector can’t map metadata or\ncustom fields.\n\n### No line items\n\nYou can create a credit note without line items. If the amount is less than the\noriginal invoice total, the connector uses a global credit note item.\n\n### Invoice line items with revenue recognition\n\nThe NetSuite revenue recognition engine can use the information contained in the\ncredit memo to calculate revenue recognition. If associated with an invoice line\nitem, the connector adds the start date and end date from the invoice to the\ncredit memo.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Dashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/dashboard/credit-notes)\n- [API](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/programmatic-credit-notes)\n- [edit the amount due](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/invoice-edits)",
