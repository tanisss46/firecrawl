  "content": "# Stripe Apps\n\n## Extend Stripe with third party services or embed custom user experiences directly in the Stripe Dashboard.\n\nStripe Apps provides the opportunity to become a third-party developer for\nStripe. You can develop and privately distribute or publish your Stripe app on\nthe global [Stripe Apps Marketplace](https://marketplace.stripe.com/). As a\nthird-party Stripe Apps developer, you can create apps to:\n\n- Authenticate users for third-party services using OAuth 2.0 or a restricted\nAPI key (RAK).\n- Use the Stripe API to make calls, listen to events, and automate workflows.\nFor example, you can create an app that automatically initiates a billing flow\nwhen a customer signs a contract, to streamline tasks and reducing manual\naccount reconciliation.\n- Design custom user interfaces that operate directly within the Stripe\nDashboard. For example, users can interact with customer records, balance\nstatements, and payment information in their CRM systems.\n\n#### Note\n\nStripe Apps serve as an extension of Stripe. To learn how to accept payments,\nsee [Payments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments). To accept and send multiparty\npayments, see [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect). To build a lightweight\ntool you can test, see [Developer tools](https://docs.stripe.com/development).\n\n![The types of Stripe Apps you can build as a\ndeveloper](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/overview-v2.7266d8efad9da259a2bfcf634b259f08.png)\n\nThe main types of apps you can develop\n\nAs a Stripe Apps user, you have access to a range of apps on the Stripe Apps\nMarketplace to help bolster or expand your business on Stripe. You can also\nintegrate Stripe into existing third-party services or platforms to synchronize\ndata fields, trigger external workflows, or use Stripe as a payment processor.\n\n## Get
