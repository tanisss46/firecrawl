# Accept a payment using local cards in NigeriaPrivate preview

Stripe-hosted pageDirect API
#### Caution

Stripe automatically presents your customers payment method options by
evaluating their currency, payment method restrictions, and other parameters. We
recommend that you configure your payment methods from the Stripe Dashboard
using the instructions in [Accept a
payment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web&ui=stripe-hosted).

If you want to continue manually configuring the payment methods you present to
your customers with Checkout, use this guide. Otherwise, update your integration
to [configure payment methods in the
Dashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/dashboard-payment-methods).

Integrating with Naira card enables Nigerian customers to pay using
Nigerian-issued cards.

Local cards offer a redirect-based payment flow. When a customer makes a
payment, Stripe redirects them to the local merchant of record service
providerâ€™s checkout page to authenticate and authorize the payment. After the
customer authorizes the payment, Stripe redirects them back to your site.

Enable Naira card by making the following updates to your integration.

When creating a [Checkout
Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions), you must do the
following:

- Add `ng_card` to the list of `payment_method_types`.
- Make sure all `line_items` use the `ngn` currency.

```
Stripe::Checkout::Session.create({
 mode: 'payment',
 payment_method_types: ['card'],
 payment_method_types: ['card', 'ng_card'],
 line_items: [{
 price_data: {
 currency: 'usd',
 # To accept `ng_card`, all line items must have currency: ngn
 currency: 'ngn',
 product_data: {
 name: 'T-shirt',
 },
 unit_amount: 2000,
 },
 quantity: 1,
 }],
 success_url: 'https://example.com/success',
 cancel_url: 'https://example.com/cancel',
})
```
