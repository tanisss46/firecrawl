Visit the [support\nsite](https://support.stripe.com/express/topics/1099-tax-forms) to learn more\nabout how to verify your tax information and receive your forms\n\nIf you’re a business collecting tax, you must file and remit the tax collected\nin every location that you’re [registered\nin](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/registering). The tax authority in each location\ndetermines the rules for reporting and filing taxes. For example, some states in\nthe US want businesses to report at the city, county, or other level when\nfiling, whereas others only need information at a more consolidated or state\nlevel. Additionally, each location mandates their own method and timing of\nremittance, and can vary depending on your volume of sales into that location\n\n## Filing frequency\n\nThe local tax authority specifies the tax filing frequency during the tax\ncollection registration process. Depending on your specific requirements, you\nmight need to remit tax monthly, annually, or on another designated frequency.\nFiling frequencies can vary based on factors such as annual revenue and other\nconsiderations. Contact your local tax authority to confirm your filing\nfrequency, if you’re uncertain.\n\n## Refunds\n\nExports and reports include refunds. If you issue a refund of tax when your\ncustomer returns a purchase, local tax authorities might require an amendment to\nthe original tax return to process the refund. To claim the refund on your tax\nreturn, reach out to your local tax authority.\n\n## Filing with Stripe\n\nStripe Tax works with select filing partners that help automate much of the tax\nfiling process to reduce manual work and eliminate potential errors. Stripe\npartners with three solutions: Taxually, Marosa, and Hands-off Sales Tax. Each\npartner caters to different geographical needs and business types.\n\n#### Note\n\nFor US-based businesses, integrated filing is only available as part of a Stripe\nTax subscription.
