## When to register for tax collection

about your potential tax registration obligations in Arizona. Stripe also
notifies you with email and Dashboard alerts when you need to register to
collect tax. Learn more about how the [monitoring tool
works](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/monitoring).

Remote sellers must register to collect and remit tax in Arizona when, in the
previous calendar year, they exceed a sales threshold of 250,000 USD.

The threshold includes gross sales, except marketplace sales. The threshold
excludes marketplace sales.

## Register to collect tax

Register for sales tax in Arizona at the [tax
authority](https://azdor.gov/business/transaction-privilege-tax). Read more

also use [Stripe to

After you’ve registered to collect tax in Arizona, go to
[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations?location=us-az)

calculation and collection in Stripe for your transactions in Arizona.

Learn [how to add your
registration](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/registering#track-your-registrations-in-the-tax-dashboard)
in the Dashboard.

## How we calculate taxes

If your [origin address](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/set-up#origin-address) is
in the US and differs from your customer’s state, Stripe always calculates tax
based on your customer’s location.

If your customer is in Arizona and your origin address is also in Arizona,
Stripe applies tax based on your origin address, depending on the type of
product or service you sell.

## Report and file your taxes

Stripe provides reports of your completed tax transactions. Go to
[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations) to access these
reports.

### Exports

The tax transaction data export provides a comprehensive and aggregated view of
transactions by location, including a breakdown of individual tax amounts. Learn
more about [tax reporting exports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports#exports).

### Location reports

[Location reports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports#us-location-reports)
offer a summary of transaction and refund data for specific US locations and
align with Arizona filing requirements. You have the option to report on an
annual, quarterly, or monthly basis.

Reporting-specific considerations:

- Some areas of Arizona have a different tax rate for purchases of a certain
value. The different tax rate can be applied to either the total price of the
purchase or only the amount above the triggering price. You won’t see a location
report for Arizona if you have these transactions. Use the
[exports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports#exports) instead for a detailed
tax breakdown of each transaction.
- Native American reservations that are located in Arizona might impose Tribal
taxes when doing business within their borders. A warning message appears when a
report contains a transaction from this location. These taxes are not managed by
the state and require separate filing.

### Filing

Stripe Tax has filing partners—Taxually, Marosa, and Hands-off Sales Tax
(HOST)—to help automate your tax filing. These partners automatically sync your
tax transaction data in real time, eliminating the need for manual data entry or
file transfers. Learn more about [tax
filing](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/filing).
