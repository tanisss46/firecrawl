  "content": "# Pause payments and payouts on connected accounts\n\n## Support risk management by controlling the flow of funds into and out of your connected accounts.\n\nPlatforms can pause payments or [payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts) on\naccounts where they’re liable for negative balances, including Express and\nCustom accounts, through the [Connected Account\ndetails](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard/managing-individual-accounts)\nDashboard page. Unlike [rejecting an\naccount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account/reject), you can pause payments or\npayouts regardless of the connected account’s balance. You can unpause payments\nor payouts at any time through the same page.\n\n![Risk Action\nDropdown](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/risk-action-dropdown.2ae7b4d238c08427d9a9f67fbbeda87f.png)\n\n## Effects of pausing payments or payouts\n\n### Pausing payments\n\nPausing payments blocks creation of any charges. It also makes the\n[transfer](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities#transfers),\n[card_payments](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities#card-payments)\nand other [payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities#payment-methods)\ncapabilities `inactive`.\n\n### Pausing payouts\n\nPausing payouts blocks creation of both automatic and manual payouts. The pause\nalso stops processing of any in-flight payouts, which remain in `pending` status\nfor up to 10 days:\n\n- If you unpause payouts within 10 days of a payout’s creation, the payout\nresumes.\n- If you don’t unpause payouts within 10 days of a payout’s creation, the payout\nis canceled and the funds are returned to the connected account’s balance.\n\n#### Note\n\nYou can pause payments in both live mode and test mode. However, in test mode we\ndon’t enforce it. Pausing payments in test mode deactivates the corresponding\ncapabilities on the account, but that doesn’t block the creation of charges.\n\nAfter performing an action on a connected account, you can view the change in\nthe account’s status, which is reflected in the Accounts API. In the API\nresponse for the connected account, the `charges_enabled` or `payouts_enabled`\nfields return `false` depending on the action taken, and the `requirements` hash\nhas a `disabled_reason` of `platform_paused`.\n\n```\n{\n \"id\": \"{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}\",\n ...\n \"charges_enabled\": false,\n \"payouts_enabled\": false,\n \"requirements\": {\n \"disabled_reason\": \"platform_paused\"\n }\n}\n```\n\n### Filter connected accounts by risk action\n\nBy visiting the [Connected Account\nlist](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard/viewing-all-accounts) page, you\ncan filter for the accounts that you have restricted either payments or payouts\nfor.\n\n![Filter by risk\naction](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/risk-action-filter.e5de33081fc98d114e3082284a251f6f.png)\n\n### Connected account notifications\n\nActioned accounts with access to the Express Dashboard see a notice there,\nexplaining that their platform paused payments or payouts on their account, and\ntelling them to direct any questions to their platform.\n\nActioned accounts without access to a Stripe-hosted Dashboard, including Custom\naccounts, don’t see any communication from Stripe. You’re responsible for\nnotifying them when you pause their payments or payouts.\n\n## Links\n\n- [payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts)\n- [Connected Account\ndetails](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard/managing-individual-accounts)\n- [rejecting an account](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account/reject)\n- [transfer](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities#transfers)\n-\n[card_payments](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities#card-payments)\n- [payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities#payment-methods)\n- [Connected Account\nlist](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard/viewing-all-accounts)",
