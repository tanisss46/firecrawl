  "content": "# Migrate from the Basic Integration to the Mobile Payment Element\n\n## Upgrade your legacy mobile SDK integration before we remove it from the SDK.\n\nEffective November 4, 2024, Stripe’s [iOS\nSDK](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios), [Android\nSDK](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-android), and [React Native\nSDK](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native) no longer support our legacy\nBasic Integration for collecting credit card and wallet payments.\n\n- To use SDK versions published after November 4, 2024, you must remove the\nBasic Integration code references in your app and upgrade to the Mobile Payment\nElement.\n- You can still process payments through older versions of the SDK, but you risk\nmissing critical security enhancements and new features.\n\nUpgrading to the Mobile Payment Element gives you access to:\n\n- Over 100 global payment methods including\n[Link](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/mobile-payment-element-link),\nStripe’s accelerated checkout\n- The ability to display saved payment methods to buyers for future purchases\n- The [Appearance\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/appearance-api?platform=ios), which allows\nyou to customize the look and feel to match your app\n\n![Example of benefits gained when migrating from Basic Integration to Payment\nElement](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/mobile-bi-migration-to-mpe.df130554a0f82a3a3c84a6602944f823.png)\n\nIn iOS, [Basic Integration](https://docs.stripe.com/mobile/ios/basic) includes:\n\n- `STPCustomerContext`\n- `STPPaymentContext`\n- `STPPaymentOptionsViewController`\n- `STPAddCardViewController`\n- `STPShippingAddressViewController`\n\nIn Android, [Basic Integration](https://docs.stripe.com/mobile/android/basic)\nincludes:\n\n- `CustomerSession`\n- `PaymentSession`\n- `PaymentMethodsActivity`\n- `AddPaymentMethodActivity`\n- `PaymentFlowActivity`\n[Migrate to the Mobile Payment\nElement](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/mobile/migrating-to-mobile-payment-element-from-basic-integration#implement-mobile-payment-element)\nThe Basic Integration is generally used in one of two ways:\n\n- **Checkout page**: Users enter their credit card, then click a button in your\napp to complete their purchase.\n- **Wallet**: Users add a credit card to your app, then use that credit card to\npay later in a different flow.\n\nSelect the tab below that matches your use case, either Checkout page or a\nwallet:\n\nCheckout pageWallet\nUse the following integration guides to implement the Mobile Payment Element on\na checkout page in your apps:\n\n- [iOS\nIntegration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment-deferred?platform=ios&type=payment&integration=paymentsheet-flowcontroller)\n- [Android\nIntegration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment-deferred?platform=android&type=payment&integration=paymentsheet-flowcontroller)\n\nThe integration guides linked above differ from the default Mobile Payment\nElement [integration\nguide](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=ios) in a few\nimportant ways.\n\n### Flow Controller\n\nThe Mobile Payment Element has a variant called “Flow Controller” (imported from\nthe SDK as `PaymentSheet.FlowController`). As with the Basic Integration, the\nFlow Controller lets you collect payment details in the sheet, then process the\npayment when your user taps a final pay button in your checkout.\n\n### Intent creation time\n\nWhen migrating from the Basic Integration to the Mobile Payment Element, create\nthe Intent after rendering the Mobile Payment Element by providing an\n`PaymentSheet.IntentConfiguration` object to `PaymentSheet`. Set the `mode`\nproperty in your `PaymentSheet.IntentConfiguration` object to `payment`, and\nprovide the amount and currency for the transaction.\n\n### Set up for future usage\n\nThe Basic Integration lets users add cards to their account in your mobile\napplication. To get this same behavior from `PaymentSheet.FlowController`, set\nthe `setupFutureUsage` parameter in your `PaymentSheet.IntentConfiguration`\nobject to `onSession`.\n\n[Check for other legacy\ndependencies](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/mobile/migrating-to-mobile-payment-element-from-basic-integration#additional-considerations)\nUpgrading to the Mobile Payment Element requires you to update other\ndependencies within your mobile integration. Review the following sections to\nmake sure your migration is comprehensive.\n\n### Migrate from the Charges API\n\nIf your integration still uses the Charges API with tokens, you must migrate to\nthe Intents API. The Mobile Payment Element integration guide linked above\nincludes details on how to use Intents. You can also review [Migrating to the\nPayment Intents API](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents/migration)\nfor more details.\n\n### Convert your configuration\n\nThe Basic Integration uses a configuration object to customize your integration\n(`STPPaymentConfiguration` for iOS, and `PaymentSessionConfig` for Android).\nConvert your Basic Integration configuration to a `PaymentSheet.Configuration`\nto customize Mobile Payment Element.\n\n## Links\n\n- [iOS SDK](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios)\n- [Android SDK](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-android)\n- [React Native SDK](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native)\n- [Link](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/mobile-payment-element-link)\n- [Appearance API](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/appearance-api?platform=ios)\n- [Basic Integration](https://docs.stripe.com/mobile/ios/basic)\n- [Basic Integration](https://docs.stripe.com/mobile/android/basic)\n- [iOS\nIntegration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment-deferred?platform=ios&type=payment&integration=paymentsheet-flowcontroller)\n- [Android\nIntegration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment-deferred?platform=android&type=payment&integration=paymentsheet-flowcontroller)\n- [integration\nguide](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=ios)\n- [Migrating to the Payment Intents\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents/migration)",
