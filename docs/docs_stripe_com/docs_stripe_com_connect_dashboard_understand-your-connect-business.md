## Business insights

The main section of the page displays high-level metrics that you can use to
better understand the health of your payments business, including:

### Top grossing accounts list

A list of your five highest grossing accounts and their total lifetime gross
amounts.

### Account status chart

A snapshot of the current numbers of your connected accounts in **Active**,
**Restricted soon**, and **Restricted**
[statuses](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard#status-badges).

## Tasks

The tasks section of the page displays cards representing platform tasks that
you must complete. The tasks depend on the types of connected accounts that your
platform supports. Each card links to a details page that explains how to
complete that task.

If you have no open tasks to complete, you don’t see the Tasks section.

### Task details page

A task details page contains specific information required for you to complete
the task. It can include actions, deadlines, and links to relevant resources.

A task can have one of the following statuses:

- **Not started**
- **In progress**
- **Complete**

When you complete a task, you can mark it complete by clicking **Complete**.

Here’s an example of the details page for the **Modify your onboarding** task:

## Resources

The Resources section of the overview page contains cards representing
additional Connect resources. Each card links to a Stripe resource where you can
learn more about a particular topic.
