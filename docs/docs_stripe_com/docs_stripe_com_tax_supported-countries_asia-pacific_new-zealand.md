# Collect tax in New Zealand

## Learn how to use Stripe Tax to calculate, collect, and report tax in New Zealand.

In New Zealand, Stripe Tax supports calculation and collection of
[GST](https://www.ird.govt.nz/gst).

## When to register for tax collection

See [Thresholds](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/thresholds) to get insights
about your potential tax registration obligations in New Zealand. Stripe also
notifies you with email and Dashboard alerts when you need to register to
collect tax. Learn more about how the [monitoring tool
works](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/monitoring).

Remote sellers supplying goods or services in New Zealand must register if their
taxable turnover from these transactions exceeded 60,000 NZD within the past
12-month period or will exceed this amount in the next 12 months. These rules
apply to businesses supplying remote services such as digital content or
low-value goods from outside New Zealand to customers who are resident in New
Zealand and aren’t registered for GST. Sales to New Zealand GST-registered
businesses that are subject to reverse charge don’t count towards the threshold.

- **Threshold**: 60,000 NZD
- **Time frame**: Previous or current year.
- **Included transactions**: Any taxable transactions that reverse charge
doesn’t apply to.

## How we calculate taxes

Stripe calculates GST for your transactions in New Zealand.

Generally, most transactions are taxable in the jurisdiction where your customer
is. Stripe assumes the sale of most goods or services to be taxable unless
specifically exempted.

## Report and file your taxes

Stripe provides reports of your completed tax transactions. Go to
[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations) to access these
reports. Learn more about [the different types of
reports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports).

You’re responsible for filing and remitting your taxes to New Zealand. Stripe
doesn’t file taxes on your behalf. However, we do have trusted partners who can
help manage your filing and remittance.
