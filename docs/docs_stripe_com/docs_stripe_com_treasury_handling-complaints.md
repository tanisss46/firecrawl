# Handling complaints

## Learn how to properly handle complaints about Stripe Treasury or Stripe Issuing.

Complaints are any expression of dissatisfaction with a product, service,
policy, or employee related to Stripe Treasury and/or Issuing, except those
expressions made by employees of your company. Proper handling of complaints is
mandatory when offering financial services products.

You must provide your customers with an easily identifiable and accessible way
to submit complaints. Include instructions on how to efficiently submit
complaints close to your customer support contact information or an equally
obvious location. You’re ultimately responsible for resolving complaints, but
Stripe can provide guidance and support when needed.

Stripe expects you to acknowledge all operational (standard) complaints within 5
business days and resolve them within 15 business days from the complaint
submission date. You must maintain records of all complaints and resolutions in
accordance with applicable law. Upon request, you must provide Stripe with
reasonable access to all pending and resolved complaints.

When you or someone representing your platform becomes aware of an executive
complaint regarding Treasury or Issuing products, promptly notify Stripe within
1 business day of the complaint submission date. Executive complaints include
any threats of litigation or complaints from regulators and complaints that
allege Unfair or Deceptive Acts and Practices (UDAP), discrimination, consumer
harm, or legal concerns. Upon receipt of an executive complaint, please refrain
from further interaction with the customer until Stripe reviews the complaint.
Stripe works closely with you to resolve all executive complaints.

In addition, you must report an aggregated list of complaints to Stripe on a
monthly basis. Stripe uses the list to make sure that the product is adhering to
regulatory requirements. Facilitate easy complaint submission by providing clear
and obvious options on your support site or other relevant customer service
product area.

To demonstrate your adherence to these complaint handling requirements, Stripe
asks that you keep thorough records of all complaints. This includes email
interactions and any documentation developed in the course of resolving
complaints.

Given that you’re responsible for managing customer support, as well as
resolving most complaints, it’s important to distinguish between a regular
customer service inquiry and a complaint. The following guidelines help you
distinguish between general customer service inquiries and complaints. If you’re
uncertain, forward the customer inquiry to Stripe to help determine whether the
communication constitutes a complaint.

## Complaint channels

Your platform can receive complaints through various means, including by
telephone, in person, social media, email, a regulatory agency, direct written
communication, and so on. You must forward complaints to Stripe in email. If you
permit your customers to raise complaints through means other than email, either
direct your customer to resend the complaint in an email, or summarize the
user’s complaint and email the complaint to Stripe. You must address all
complaints, regardless of how you receive them.

## Complaint types

The following table provides guidelines to determine the type of complaint you
might receive.

filed a complaint with a regulatory agency
- A person threatening to bring a legal action against your platform, Stripe, or
a banking partner
- Complaints that allege Unfair or Deceptive Acts and Practices (UDAP),
discrimination, or consumer harm
- Product or service complaints, which are complaints about customer service or

the following:

- Disclosures or notices

practices

## Differentiating between complaints and customer service inquiry

A customer service inquiry can be verbal or written, and includes a request to
you for information and assistance related to a Treasury or Issuing program
element. This could include address changes; account inquiries; questions about
a product’s availability in certain jurisdictions; technical inquiries related
to your platform, Stripe’s platform, or a third-party platform that’s integrated
with Stripe’s platform; or a request for refund of fees.

The key distinguishing factor that differentiates an inquiry from a complaint is
the customer’s expression of dissatisfaction, which might be transparent either
in the use of specific phrasing (“trigger words”) or in the customer’s general
tone in communicating.

The following trigger words differentiate a complaint from a customer service
inquiry:

- Abuse or abusive **
- Marital status (married, single, or divorced)
- Angry or mad
- Military or service member
- Annoyed
- National origin **
- Attorney or lawyer
- Opt in or opt out
- Bait and switch **
- Predatory **
- Bias or prejudice **
- Privacy
- Deceived **
- Problem
- Disclosure or disclose
- Race, minority, or color **
- Discrimination or discriminate **
- Redlining or redline **
- Disgraceful **
- Regulator or regulatory
- Exploit or manipulate **
- Religion, age, or disability **
- Fairness or unfair **
- Ridiculous
- Financial injury
- Sex or gender **
- Foul language
- Sexual orientation **
- Fraud or ID theft
- Sue
- Hide or hidden
- Unauthorized
- Lawsuit
- Unbelievable **
- Litigation
- Unfair **
- Low income or poor
- Unhappy or not happy
- Ludicrous

** Complaints containing these trigger words or synonyms might allege unfair or
deceptive acts and practices (UDAP) or discrimination. This list isn’t
exhaustive and Stripe might add other trigger words to this list.

In addition to the preceding trigger words, consider the tone of the
communication and reference the examples below when making a determination and
consider similar circumstances for complaint identification.

- A customer expresses dissatisfaction with you, your Stripe-run products or
services, Stripe, or a bank partner.
- A customer states that they wish to file a complaint.
- A customer states that a business practice or employee interaction is
misleading, unfair, deceptive, abusive, or a combination of these.
- A customer alleges discrimination.
- A customer threatens to file suit against you, Stripe, or a bank partner.
- Customer alleges that you, your Stripe-run products or services, Stripe, or a
bank partner violate a specific law or regulation or questions the legality of a
practice.
- A customer notes multiple or repeated attempts to obtain information or
resolve a concern (use of words like “still,” “repeated,” and so on).
- An attorney sends a complaint letter on behalf of a customer.
- A regulatory or government agency initiates a complaint.

Examples of what isn’t a complaint:

- A customer address correction or change.
- Account inquiries or requests for assistance.
- Inquiries regarding technical assistance (for example, error messages) or
problems interacting with the Stripe platform, its integration with third-party
services, or both.

## Complaints tracking

Stripe requires all Issuing and Treasury platforms to regularly share complaints
received from their connected accounts. You must complete reporting each month
before the tenth calendar day of the following month.

Each platform receives a unique and secure form after onboarding to record
complaints. If your platform can’t locate your complaints form, contact
[complaints-issuing-treasury@stripe.com](mailto:complaints-issuing-treasury@stripe.com).

If you don’t receive any complaints in a month, you must still let Stripe know
by following the steps in the **No complaints attestation** tab in your
platform’s unique complaints form.
