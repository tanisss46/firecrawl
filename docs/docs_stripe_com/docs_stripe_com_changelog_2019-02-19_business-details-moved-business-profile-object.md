# Several fields describing an account's business details have moved to the business_profile subhashBreaking changes

## What’s new

Moves `business_name`, `business_url`, `product_description`, `support_address`,
`support_email`, `support_phone` and `support_url` to the `business_profile`
subhash.

## Impact

This change reorganizes several business-related fields by moving them into a
new `business_profile` subhash within the `Account` object. You need to update
your code to access and update these fields under the new `business_profile`
structure instead of the root level of the `Account` object.
