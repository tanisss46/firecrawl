# Design a no-code integration

## Learn which no-code solutions can help your business.

Use Stripe for your business without writing any code. This guide helps you
understand which no-code products and services best fit your business.

You have to [register](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register) for a [Stripe
account](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/activate) and verify your
email before you use any of these products or solutions. After you register, you
can access the Dashboard to manage and configure your account and business.

## No-code components

The following table describes different components that you can use to set up
Stripe without writing code. You don’t need to use all of the components. Use
what you need now and add or combine features as your business grows.

ComponentDescription[Dashboard mobile
app](https://stripe.com/payments/features#dashboard-mobile-app) A native app for
accessing your Dashboard on your mobile device. You can use the app to accept
in-person payments, generate invoices, and create subscriptions and payment
links. Download on
[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id978516833?pt=91215812&ct=stripe-mobile-app-nocode-docs&mt=8)
or
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stripe.android.dashboard&hl=en_US&gl=US)
to get started.[Product
catalog](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/overview) Represent your
products on Stripe by configuring a product catalog and pricing model. Create
recurring prices to enable subscriptions. Payment Links and subscriptions
require products. You can use invoices without a product catalog. [Learn
more](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/how-products-and-prices-work) or
[go to the Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/products).[Payment
Links](https://docs.stripe.com/no-code/payment-links) Payment Links are reusable
links that take your customers to a prebuilt checkout page. Share links through
social media, SMS, and email or by embedding them on your site. You can use
Payment Links for one-time purchases, donations, tips, or subscriptions. [Learn
more](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links) or [go to the
Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payment-links).[Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/no-code/invoices)
Create and send branded invoices to customers and clients. Optionally, set up
the customer portal to allow your customers to manage their own invoices and
billing information. [Learn more](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing) or [go to
the
Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/invoices).[Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/no-code/subscriptions)
Let your customers sign up for subscriptions with Payment Links or on your
website, or manually create subscriptions. Manage the recurring payments,
subscription-generated invoices, and recovery options in the Dashboard. [Learn
more](https://docs.stripe.com/billing) or [go to the
Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/subscriptions).[Customer
portal](https://docs.stripe.com/no-code/customer-portal) Let your customers
manage their own accounts by setting up the customer portal. They can update
their billing information and payment methods, pay and download invoices, and
manage their subscriptions. [Learn
more](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management) or go to the
[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/portal).
[Buy button](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links/buy-button)

Low code
Create an embeddable buy button to add to your website. Select an existing link
from the Payment Links list view or create a new link, then configure the buy
button design and generate the code that you can copy and paste into your
website.

[Pricing table](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/pricing-table)

Low code
Create a pricing table to display your pricing plans and features in an
embeddable UI component. Design the table in the Dashboard, then copy the code
into your website. Pricing tables require using
[Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout).

[Branding](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/branding)Customize Stripe
product interfaces to reflect your branding. [Learn about custom
branding](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/branding) or [go to the
Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding) to get started.
## Sell and get paid online

To accept payments online without building a website, [create a payment
link](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links/create). You can [share the same
payment link](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links/share) across multiple
channels, like email, SMS, and social media. If you already have a website,
[embed a buy button](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links/buy-button) using the
payment link. From the Dashboard, you can [change the
appearance](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding) of the payment link
page and [enable more payment
methods](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods).

## Get and retain subscribers

You can support the entire billing lifecycle for your customers with
Stripe-hosted pages and automation tools:

- Create your entire billing flow in a few steps.
- Create a [pricing
table](https://docs.stripe.com/no-code/get-started#pricing-table) so customers
can compare different plans and buy one.
- Use [Dynamic payment
methods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/dynamic-payment-methods)
to let your customers pay with their preferred payment method.
- Let customers manage their own subscriptions with a [Stripe-hosted
portal](https://docs.stripe.com/no-code/get-started#customer-portal). Use
revenue recovery features to minimize involuntary churn and maximize your
chances of getting paid.

You can also use Payment Links to offer subscriptions when you [sell and get
paid online](https://docs.stripe.com/no-code/get-started#sell-online).

#### For developers

integration, see the [SaaS use case guide](https://docs.stripe.com/saas).

## Create and send quotes and invoices

Share a price estimate with your customers, then convert an approved quote into
an invoice. Create, customize, send, and revise a Stripe-hosted invoice in a few
steps.

Use our [revenue recovery
features](https://docs.stripe.com/no-code/get-started#recover-failed-payments)

collection.

If your business includes in-person transactions, use your mobile device to
accept payments in person through your Stripe account with [Tap to
Pay](https://docs.stripe.com/no-code/tap-to-pay), manual card entry, or QR codes
in the Stripe Dashboard app. To get started, [register a Stripe
account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register), then download the

app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stripe.android.dashboard&hl=en_US&gl=US).
