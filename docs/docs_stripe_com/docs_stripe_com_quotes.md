# Quotes

## Provide pricing estimates to customers before starting a subscription or invoice.

You can use quotes to combine recurring and one-off line items so you can
provide your customers with a price estimate, including any discounts or taxes.
​​You can convert the quote into a recurring
[subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating) or a
one-time [invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices) after the customer
accepts the quote.

## How it works

With quotes, you can provide estimates and initiate invoices or subscriptions
without adding additional custom logic in your integration. See the [integration
guide](https://docs.stripe.com/quotes/overview) or view the [API
reference](https://docs.stripe.com/api/quotes) for more details.
