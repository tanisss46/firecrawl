# Subscription and cancellation policies

## Learn about subscription fees and cancellation policies.

Stripe offers annual subscription plans for various products. These plans
include a set product usage entitlement and require an annual commitment. Learn
how to manage your subscription, including cancellation, renewal, and billing
processes using this guide.

## Cancel a subscription

All of our subscription plans require a **one-year** commitment. Your annual
contract begins at midnight UTC of the day after you sign up, and runs for 1
year. After you enroll, you’re responsible for paying subscription fees and
potential overage fees incurred for the full term, regardless if you schedule a
cancellation before your contract ends.

Subscription plans automatically renew for another one year term unless you
schedule a cancellation before the renewal date.

To prevent automatic renewal, you must:

- Cancel your subscription at least 24 hours in advance of your renewal date
- Have [administrator
access](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/teams/roles)

To schedule a cancellation of your subscription:

- Navigate to your account’s [settings
page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings).
- Click **Your plans**.
- Find the plan you want to cancel, and click **Manage plan**.
- Click **Cancel**, and review and confirm your cancellation. Your plan’s detail
page displays the scheduled cancellation date.

After your current contract period ends, your account will automatically
transition to a [pay-as-you-go plan](https://stripe.com/pricing).

#### Note

Stripe subscription plans require an annual commitment. When you subscribe, you
agree to pay for the full annual term, including any incurred overage fees.
**Payments are non-refundable**, and we don’t offer prorated refunds if you
cancel before the end of your term.

## Stripe subscription fees

All of our subscriptions require an annual commitment. A subscription fee covers
product usage up to the entitlement limit for your selected plan during your
current term. If usage exceeds your entitlement, overage fees will apply.

To learn more about these fees, see our [pricing](https://stripe.com/pricing).

## Product usage entitlements

Product usage entitlement is the amount of usage included in your subscription
plan. This is the limit you selected when signing up, and it determines how much
of the product you can use without incurring additional charges. If you exceed
this entitlement, overage fees apply.

## Overage fees

Overage fees are additional fees incurred when product usage entitlement is
exceeded. These fees only apply to usage beyond your selected product
entitlement and are billed at the end of your billing period monthly. For Stripe
Tax subscriptions, any fees for non-US tax filings will appear as overages.

The following examples illustrate typical overage fees:

## Charge schedule and bills

You’ll be charged your recurring subscription fee when your subscription starts,
and again at the start of every subsequent billing period thereafter (this
aligns with whichever plan you selected). You’ll be charged for any overage fees
at the end of the month that they were incurred.

### Stripe Billing example:

**Billing Schedule**:

- Contract term: If you sign up on September 14, 2025, your contract runs from
September 15, 2025, at 00:00 UTC – September 14, 2026, at 23:59 UTC.
- Subscription fee: $7,440 USD for the year, billed in monthly installments of
$620 USD plus applicable taxes.
- Billing cycle: The first $620 USD subscription charge occurs on September 15,
followed by October 15, November 15, and so on.

**Overage Fees**:

Overage fees apply if you exceed your product usage entitlement. In this
example, the usage entitlement is 100,000 USD per month. These are charged at
the end of the billing period in which they occur.

- Monthly usage (September 15 – October 14): $150,000 USD processed
- Overage: $50,000 USD beyond entitlement
- Overage charge: $335 USD (50,000 × 0.67%)
- October 15 Bill:- $335 USD overage fee (for September 15 – October 14)
- $620 USD monthly subscription fee (for October 15 – November 14)

### Stripe Tax example:

**Billing Schedule**:

- Contract term: If you sign up on September 14, 2025, your contract runs from
September 15, 2025, at 00:00 UTC – September 14, 2026, at 23:59 UTC.
- Subscription fee: $1,080 USD for the year, billed in monthly installments of
$90 USD plus applicable taxes.
- Billing cycle: The first $90 USD subscription charge occurs on September 15,
followed by October 15, November 15, and so on.

**Overage Fees**:

Overage fees apply if your usage exceeds your product usage entitlement. These
are charged at the end of the billing period in which they occur.

- Monthly usage (September 15 – October 14):- 1,500 calculation API calls
- 300 transactions
- 3 U.S. tax registrations
- 1 U.S. filing
- Entitlement exceeded:- 100 additional transactions → $50 USD overage fee
($0.50 × 100)
- 1 additional U.S. tax registration → $150 USD overage fee
- October 15 Bill:- $200 USD overage fee (for September 15 – October 14)
- $90 USD monthly subscription fee (for October 15 – November 14)

For more details on subscription pricing and overage rates, see [Stripe
Pricing](https://stripe.com/pricing). If you have any questions about your bill,
[contact Stripe](https://support.stripe.com/?contact=true).

## How Stripe charges you

Your subscription fee is deducted from your Stripe account balance. Standard
[terms and conditions](https://stripe.com/legal/ssa) for payments made via your
Stripe Account balance apply.

## Minimum contractual commitment for subscription-based plans

All of our subscription plans require an annual commitment. Your annual contract
starts at midnight UTC of the day after you sign up, and ends 1 year later.
After you sign up for a subscription, *you’re responsible for paying for the
entire year*, even if you schedule a cancellation during your current term.

If you’re looking for something more flexible, we have [pay-as-you-go pricing
plans](https://stripe.com/pricing).

## Automatic subscription renewals

All of our subscription plans automatically renew on the anniversary date for an
additional 1 year term. If you don’t want to automatically renew, you need to
schedule a cancellation of your subscription before the auto-renew date, as
outlined in our [cancellation
policy](https://docs.stripe.com/finance-automation/subscription-pricing/cancel#cancel-a-subscription).

## Accidental cancellations

If you scheduled a subscription cancellation by mistake, you can undo this at
any time before the contract renewal date:

- Navigate to your account’s [settings
page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings).
- Click **Your plans**.
- Find the plan you want to re-subscribe:
- If your plan is scheduled to be canceled, click **Revert cancellation** below
the cancellation details and confirm.
- If your cancellation has already occurred, you need to resubscribe by clicking
**View plans** and following the steps to subscribe again.

After reinstated, your subscription will automatically renew on the original
auto-renew date (your 1 year contract anniversary).

## Changing your plan

You can *upgrade* your plan at any time.

### Stripe Billing

You can *upgrade* your plan at any time. The plan will be effective at the start
of your next billing period. For example, if you’re charged on the 15th of every
month, and you upgrade your plan on October 20, the new upgraded price and usage
entitlement is applied effective November 15.

You can’t downgrade your plan below your initial subscription plan during the
contract period. For example, if you sign up for the plan with 250,000 USD in
Billing volume, you can upgrade to the 500,000 USD Billing volume tier, but
can’t downgrade to the 100,000 USD Billing volume tier during the contract
period. However, you can schedule a downgrade to the 100,000 USD tier to go into
effect for the next annual contract period.

### Stripe Tax

You can upgrade your plan at any time. When you upgrade, your existing plan is
canceled and a new subscription with an annual commitment begins. The new plan
takes effect at the start of your next billing period and any remaining
entitlements from your previous subscription will no longer be available after
this date.

**Example: Upgrading Your Subscription**

If you have an annual Stripe Tax plan at 430 USD per month that started on
September 15, 2024 at 00:00 UTC, and you choose to upgrade to a 1,000 USD per
month plan on October 31 2024:

- **Existing subscription**: Your current plan remains active until November 14,
2024, at 23:59 UTC, at which point it will be cancelled. Any remaining
entitlements from this plan will no longer be available after this date.
- **New subscription**: Your new plan begins on November 15, 2024, at 00:00 UTC
with a new contract term running until November 14, 2025, at 23:59 UTC. Your
updated product usage entitlement starts at this time.

You can schedule a downgrade of your tax subscription and this will take effect
at the end of your current contract period.

To upgrade or downgrade:

- Navigate to your account’s [settings
page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings).
- Click on **Your plans**.
- Find the plan you want to change and click **Manage plan**.
- Click **View plans** to see the options available.
- Choose a new plan and follow the prompts to finalize the change.

## Monthly plans

Currently all Stripe subscriptions require an annual commitment and are billed
monthly. If you need more flexibility, we have [pay-as-you-go pricing
plans](https://stripe.com/pricing).

## Failed and missed payments

Stripe reserves the right to temporarily suspend your access to the Services if
you fail to pay or are in violation of our [standard
terms](https://stripe.com/legal/ssa). If you pay using your Stripe Balance,
standard terms and conditions apply.

## Refund policy for cancellation of pre-paid subscription

We don’t offer prorated refunds on pre-paid subscriptions. All Stripe
subscription plans require an annual commitment. You are responsible for the
full subscription fee, including applicable overage fees for the entire term. We
don’t offer refunds (prorated or otherwise) if you schedule a cancellation
before the end of your current term.

## Taxes on subscription purchases

Taxes are estimated at checkout based on current tax rates. These rates may
change, and some jurisdictions may require self-assessment for tax reporting.

## Taxually Services

Taxually is a Stripe partner that handles tax filing submissions for various
jurisdictions. When you purchase a Stripe Tax subscription, you gain access to
filing services with Taxually aligned with your plan’s entitlements. You’ll need
to set up an account with Taxually and accept their terms in order to use their
services. Stripe will process any applicable fees based on your Stripe Tax
subscription plan.
