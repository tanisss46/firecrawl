# Alma payments

## Offer European customers the ability to pay in 2, 3, or 4 installments while getting paid instantly.

[Alma](https://almapay.com/) is a Buy Now, Pay Later payment method available in
France, Italy, Spain, Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg that gives your
customers payment installment choices.

When customers select Alma as their payment method, Stripe redirects them to
Alma’s website, where they get the ability to choose between 2, 3, or 4
installments to complete their purchase. You are paid immediately.

Alma is only available for payments between 50 EUR and 5,000 EUR.

## Payment flow

Below is a demonstration of the Alma payment flow from your checkout page:

## Get started

You don’t have to integrate Alma and other payment methods individually. If you
use our front-end products, Stripe automatically determines the most relevant
payment methods to display. Go to the [Stripe
Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and enable
Alma. To get started with one of our hosted UIs, follow a quickstart:

- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart): Our prebuilt, hosted
checkout page.
- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart): Our drop-in UI
components.

### Other payment products

The following Stripe products also let you add Alma from the Dashboard:

- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)

If your integration requires manually listing payment methods, learn how to
[manually configure Alma as a
payment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/alma/accept-a-payment).

## Payment options

Depending on the customer’s billing country and the transaction amount, Alma can
present customers with various payment options. Cart ranges and geographic
availability for payment options are determined by Alma and may change at their
discretion. Regardless of the underlying payment option selected, Stripe makes
the full amount of the funds (minus fees) available to you upfront and Alma
collects the purchase amount from your customer, who repays Alma directly. These
options include:

Pay in 2, 3, or 4 (also known as Installments): Customers pay for the purchase
in two,three or four interest-free payments. The total transaction amount is
typically spread equally across the installments, but Alma might occasionally
charge your customer more in the first installment based on the customer’s
purchase power and other credit factors.

The following table lists the available payment options for supported Alma
locations.

## Prohibited business categories

In addition to the industry and business categories listed in [Prohibited and
restricted business](https://stripe.com/restricted-businesses), Alma prohibits
the following categories:

- Sole proprietorships or individual accounts
- Business to Business Services
- Educational services
- Professional services (including, but not limited to, legal, consulting, and
accounting)
- Transportation services
- Travel services
- Telecommunication services and utilities
- Veterinary services

See a [full list of prohibited
activities](https://help.almapay.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360006779359-Which-activities-are-not-eligible-for-payment-with-Alma).
Even if an activity isn’t listed as prohibited, your business might still be
ineligible for Alma due to risk-related reasons.

## Customer terms

Alma requires that you add the following terms to your general terms of sale:

- Customers can make purchases in installments using Alma.
- A customer’s purchase using Alma is subject to Alma’s terms and conditions.
- Non-approval by Alma for a purchase can result in the cancellation of that
purchase.
- A customer using Alma to purchase a good or service has a period of 14
calendar days in which they can withdraw the purchase.

## Refunds

Alma supports full and partial refunds. The refund period is up to 180 days
after the purchase. Refunds for Alma payments are asynchronous and take up to 5
minutes to complete. We will notify you of the final refund status using the
`refund.updated` or `refund.failed` [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks)
event. When a refund succeeds, the
[Refund](https://docs.stripe.com/api/refunds/object) object’s status transitions
to `succeeded`. If a refund fails, the Refund object’s status transitions to
`failed` and we return the amount to your Stripe balance. You then need to
arrange an alternative way of providing your customer with a refund.

## Disputes

Customers must authenticate Alma payments by logging into their Alma account.
This requirement helps reduce the risk of fraud or unrecognized payments. While
Alma covers losses incurred from customer fraud, Alma might contact you and
request to stop or pause shipment before incurring any losses. Please comply
promptly with these requests.

Customers have up to 120 calendar days from the date of purchase to file a
dispute. The dispute process works like this:

- After the customer initiates a dispute, Stripe notifies you through email, the
Stripe Dashboard, and an API `charge.dispute.created` event (if your integration
is set up to receive [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks)).
- Stripe holds back the disputed amount from your balance until Alma resolves
the dispute.
- Stripe requests that you upload compelling evidence that you fulfilled the
purchase order [using the Stripe
Dashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/responding#respond). This evidence
can include:

- A received return confirmation (for shipped goods returned from the customer
to you)
- The tracking ID
- The shipping date
- A record of purchase for intangible goods, such as IP address or email receipt
- A record of purchase for services or physical goods, such as phone number or
proof of receipt
- This information helps Alma determine if a dispute is valid or if it should be
rejected. Make sure the evidence you provide contains as much detail as possible
from what the customer provided at checkout. You must submit the requested
information within 14 calendar days. Alma makes a decision within 25 calendar
days of evidence submission. If Alma resolves the dispute with you winning,
Stripe returns the disputed amount to your Stripe balance. If Alma rules in
favor of the customer, the balance charge becomes permanent.

If you prefer to handle disputes programmatically, you can [respond to disputes
using the API](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/api).

#### Warning

Alma requires merchants to maintain reasonable fraud and dispute rates.
Increases to your fraud and dispute rates might result in losing access to Alma.

## Connect

Alma is available for online marketplaces using [Stripe
Connect](https://stripe.com/connect). These online marketplaces include
businesses such as Deliveroo and ManoMano that collect payments from customers,
and later pay out to sub-accounts or service providers. Alma isn’t available for
platforms that onboard other businesses and enable them to accept payments
directly, such as Shopify or Squarespace.

#### Note

Online marketplaces need to submit an onboarding request from the [Stripe
Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) to get access
to Alma. Stripe sends email updates about the progress of all requests, and the
current status is also reflected on the [Payment methods settings
page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods).

The following [Connect charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges) types,
typically used by online marketplaces, are available to businesses using Alma.
