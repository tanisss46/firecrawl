  "content": "# Multiple configurations for your Connect accounts\n\n## Learn how to allow your connected accounts to display different sets of payment methods to their buyers in different scenarios.\n\nUse this feature if your platform is using [dynamic payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dynamic-payment-methods) and supports\nsetting different types of payment methods for different types of transactions\n(for example, subscriptions versus one-time checkout) or for different invoice\namounts (for example, invoices more than a certain dollar amount can be paid\nusing BNPL).\n\n[Create a new payment method\nconfigurationDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/multiple-payment-method-configurations#create-payment-method-configuration)\nNavigate to the [Payment methods\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods/connected_accounts)\nfor your connected accounts in the Stripe Dashboard. This is where you control\nyour platform level “parent” configurations. Your connected accounts receive a\n“child” configuration for each parent that they can customize within the\nconstraints you set below.\n\nYou start with one parent configuration by default. To create an additional\nconfiguration, click **Add new configuration**, and give it a name.\n\n![Payment method configuration\npage](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/ppc-dashboard-demo-connect.93d78670fd3582900915ab57e3e219ec.png)\n\n[Set the default state for each payment\nmethodDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/multiple-payment-method-configurations#set-payment-method-default-state)\nYou can apply the default setting for each payment method to your new parent\nconfiguration, and control what customizations your connected accounts can make.\nUse the dropdown to select the desired setting:\n\n- **On by default** the payment method is on by default. Connected accounts can\nturn it on and off.\n- **Off by default** the payment method is off by default. Connected accounts\ncan turn it on and off.\n- **Blocked** turns the payment method off for all connected accounts. Connected\naccounts can’t turn it on.\n\n![Configure settings for each payment\nmethod](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/settings-api-wallets.956b27fd0756e064d433aaa5999130fe.png)\n\n[Allow your connected accounts to customize their payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/multiple-payment-method-configurations#allow-payment-method-customization)\nConnected accounts with access to the full Stripe Dashboard can turn payment\nmethods on or off if the payment method has been set to either `On by default`\nor `Off by default`. Your connected accounts see the newly created child\nconfiguration in their **Payment methods** settings. Your connected accounts can\nuse the dropdown menu at the top of the page to choose a configuration to edit.\n\nIf you want your connected accounts to customize their **Payment methods**\nsettings from your platform dashboard instead of the Stripe Dashboard, or if you\nhave connected accounts who don’t have Stripe Dashboard access, you can\nintegrate with the Payment Method Configurations API.\n\nUse the Payment Method Configurations API with the connected account ID and\nchild configuration ID to read the current state of a payment method for a\nspecific connected account on that configuration.\n\n```\ncurl\nhttps://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_method_configurations/{{PAYMENT_METHOD_CONFIGURATION_ID}}\n\\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -H \"Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}\"\n```\n\n```\n{\n \"object\": \"list\",\n \"data\": [\n {\n \"id\": \"{{PAYMENT_METHOD_CONFIGURATION_ID}}\",\n \"object\": \"payment_method_configuration\",\n \"name\": \"My Custom Configuration\",\n \"active\": true,\n \"is_default\": true,\n \"livemode\": false,\n \"parent\": \"{{PAYMENT_METHOD_CONFIGURATION_ID}}\",\n \"acss_debit\": {\n \"available\": false,\n \"display_preference\": {\n \"overridable\": true,\n \"preference\": \"off\",\n \"value\": \"off\"\n }\n },\n \"affirm\": {\n \"available\": false,\n \"display_preference\": {\n \"overridable\": true,\n \"preference\": \"off\",\n \"value\": \"off\"\n }\n },\n \"afterpay_clearpay\": {\n \"available\": false,\n \"display_preference\": {\n \"overridable\": true,\n \"preference\": \"off\",\n \"value\": \"off\"\n }\n },\n ... additional payment methods\n }\n ],\n \"has_more\": false,\n \"url\": \"/v1/payment_method_configurations\"\n}\n```\n\nIf successful, the return list displays each payment method and includes two\nparameters outlining availability and display preference.\n\n- `available` is the combination of\n[capability](https://docs.stripe.com/api/capabilities/object) value (`active`,\n`inactive`, `pending`, or `unrequested`) and `display_preference` value.\n\nYou can use the `available` field to know whether or not a buyer sees this\npayment method at checkout time. If `available` is `true`, that payment method’s\ncapability is active and `display_preference` is on. If `available` is `false`,\nthe payment method either doesn’t have an active capability or the\n`display_preference` value is off, and buyers won’t see it at checkout time. To\nsimplify your integration and take advantage of other features, use payment\nmethods that you manage from the Dashboard at checkout, which automatically\nreads this parameter and shows the right payment methods to buyers.\n- `display_preference` has three components: `overridable`, `preference`, and\n`value`.\n\n- `overridable` is read-only, and indicates whether the connected account’s\npreference can override the default set above.\n- `preference` is writable, and stores the connected account’s preference.\n- `value` is read-only, and reflects the effective `display_preference` value.\n\n#### Note\n\nOnly payment methods that are relevant in the connected account’s country are\nshown in the API response and are configurable. [Check country\nsupport](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/integration-options).\n\nWhen a connected account owner takes action to turn on or off a payment method,\nyou can update the `display_preference` `preference` attribute. This stores the\nconnected account owner’s preference for that payment method and is used to\ndetermine whether buyers see the payment method.\n\n```\ncurl\nhttps://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_method_configurations/{{PAYMENT_METHOD_CONFIGURATION_ID}}\n\\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d \"affirm[display_preference][preference]\"=on\n```\n\n```\n{\n \"id\": \"{{PAYMENT_METHOD_CONFIGURATION_ID}}\",\n \"object\": \"payment_method_configuration\",\n \"name\": \"My Custom Configuration\",\n \"active\": true,\n \"is_default\": true,\n \"livemode\": false,\n \"acss_debit\": {\n \"available\": false,\n \"display_preference\": {\n \"overridable\": true,\n \"preference\": \"off\",\n \"value\": \"off\"\n }\n },\n \"affirm\": {\n \"available\": true,\n \"display_preference\": {\n \"overridable\": true,\n \"preference\": \"on\",\n \"value\": \"on\"\n }\n },\n \"afterpay_clearpay\": {\n \"available\": false,\n \"display_preference\": {\n \"overridable\": true,\n \"preference\": \"off\",\n \"value\": \"off\"\n }\n },\n ... additional payment methods\n}\n```\n\nWhen your connected accounts turn on payment methods with the API, Stripe\nintelligently ranks the payment methods based on the buyer’s location, order\nsize, and other factors to always show the highest converting payment methods\nfirst.\n\n[Use the configuration in your checkout\nflow](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/multiple-payment-method-configurations#use-payment-method-configuration)\nPass the parent configuration ID when rendering your checkout flow to use your\nnew configuration. Stripe automatically looks up the child configuration for the\nassociated connected account and uses their customized settings.\n\nCheckoutPayment Element\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/checkout/sessions \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d mode=payment \\\n -d \"line_items[0][price]\"={{PRICE_ID}} \\\n -d \"line_items[0][quantity]\"=1 \\\n --data-urlencode success_url=\"https://example.com/success\" \\\n --data-urlencode cancel_url=\"https://example.com/cancel\" \\\n -d currency=usd \\\n -d payment_method_configuration={{PAYMENT_METHOD_CONFIGURATION_ID}}\n```\n\n[OptionalApple Pay and Google\nPay](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/multiple-payment-method-configurations#apple-pay-google-pay)\n\n## Links\n\n- [dynamic payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dynamic-payment-methods)\n- [Payment methods\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods/connected_accounts)\n- [capability](https://docs.stripe.com/api/capabilities/object)\n- [Check country\nsupport](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/integration-options)\n- [https://example.com/success](https://example.com/success)\n- [https://example.com/cancel](https://example.com/cancel)",
