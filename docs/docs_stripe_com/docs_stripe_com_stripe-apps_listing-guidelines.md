# App listing guidelines

## Follow the specifications and guidelines to define the contents of your app listing page before publishing to the App Marketplace.

Listing your app in the [Stripe App
Marketplace](https://marketplace.stripe.com/) requires you to follow the
specifications, and we provide guidelines for you to follow. You can also read
the [App review
requirements](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/review-requirements) that set
expectations for the app review process.
