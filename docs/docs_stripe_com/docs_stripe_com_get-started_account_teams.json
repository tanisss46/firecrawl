You must assign each team member at least\none role before you can invite them. Roles protect your sensitive information\nand restrict the actions team members can perform on your account. See the [list\nof actions](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/teams/roles) that each\nrole can and can’t perform before assigning the role to a team member.\n\nYou can invite team members individually, or invite multiple users at the same\ntime by separating their email addresses with a comma or space. You can also\nassign multiple roles to a team member, which gives them the combined set of\npermissions granted by those roles. Invites to your Stripe account expire after\n10 days.\n\n![Invite a team member to access your Stripe\naccount](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/invite-team-members.56ae9525e14e736f8fd9d7045b7e96f1.png)\n\nInvite a team member to access your Stripe account\n\nAfter a team member has accepted their invite, you can edit their role at any\ntime from your account’s [Team](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/team)\nsettings.
