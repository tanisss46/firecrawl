# API Worksheet PaymentsPublic preview

## Use the in-browser Stripe Shell to practice implementing key business processes.

This worksheet covers some of our APIs for collecting payments. API Worksheets

already learned the fundamentals. If you’re training for Stripe’s [Partner
Program](https://stripe.com/partners), these worksheets are a good follow up to
the e-learning course material. If you’re learning how to use Stripe on your
own, consider first exploring our [Quickstart
guide](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart) on implementing a custom
payment flow.
