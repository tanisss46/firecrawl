To finalize, download, or accept quotes in live\nmode for one-time invoices through the API or Dashboard, you must upgrade to\n[Invoicing Plus](https://stripe.com/invoicing/pricing). See which plan [is right\nfor you](https://support.stripe.com/questions/how-to-access-quotes).\n\n​​Quotes allow you to deliver estimated pricing for requested goods or services\nand can help facilitate negotiation before beginning a subscription or\n[invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices).\n\nDraft\n\nOpen\n\nAccepted\n\nCanceled\n\nHow a Quote status changes\n​​We designed the quote statuses to mirror a typical quoting flow that a sales\nagent follows, where they create a quote with line items that specify the items\nfor purchase. This includes applying any discounts or taxes, sending the quote\nto a prospective customer, and provisioning the corresponding services upon\ntheir acceptance.\n\nStatusDescriptionPossible actions`draft`​​Starting status for all quotes—at this\npoint, you can still edit the\nquote.[Finalize](https://docs.stripe.com/quotes/overview#finalize) the quote\ninto `open` or [cancel](https://docs.stripe.com/quotes/overview#cancel) the\nquote.`open`The quote is finalized and is now awaiting action from the customer.\n​​You can only edit the expiration date now.Mark the quote as `accepted` or\n[cancel](https://docs.stripe.com/quotes/overview#cancel) the\nquote.`accepted`​​The customer accepted the quote.

You can no longer accept it.N/A\n## Canceled quotes\n\nWhen a customer rejects a quote or you no longer want it to be valid, you can\ncancel it. You can no longer accept canceled quotes. Quotes that are in a\n`draft` or `open` state automatically cancel when they reach the expiration\ndate. Stripe generates a `quote.canceled` webhook.\n\n## Accepted quotes\n\n​​After the customer agrees to your quote, you can mark it as accepted. Accepted\nquotes generate an invoice, subscription, or subscription schedule\n​​automatically, depending on whether or not there are recurring prices on the\nquote or if the effective date of the quote is in the future.\n\n## Workflow transitions\n\nQuotes can transition between these statuses:\n\nStatusAPI endpointEmitted webhookEnd Status`draft`[POST\n/v1/quotes/:id/cancel](https://docs.stripe.com/api/quotes/cancel)`quote.canceled``canceled``draft`[POST\n/v1/quotes/:id/finalize](https://docs.stripe.com/api/quotes/finalize)`quote.finalized``open``open`[POST\n/v1/quotes/:id/cancel](https://docs.stripe.com/api/quotes/cancel)`quote.canceled``canceled``open`[POST\n/v1/quotes/:id/accept](https://docs.stripe.com/api/quotes/accept)`quote.accepted``accepted`\n### Finalize draft quotes\n\nQuotes are initially created as a `draft`. In this status, you can edit the\nquote and make any required changes. ​​You can finalize a quote as soon as\nyou’re ready to send it to the customer, which moves it to the `open​` status\nwhile you await action from them.\n\nFinalizing a quote also assigns a `number` to it. This number consists of four\nparts: the prefix `QT`, the customer’s invoice prefix, the quote sequence, and\nthe revision sequence. For example, `QT-68BB114-0001-1` is the first quote for a\ncustomer, and the quote is on the first revision. Quote number\n`QT-68BB114-0001-2`is the same quote but on the second revision.\n`QT-68BB114-0002-1` would be the second quote for the customer.\n\nYou can finalize a quote through the API as shown in the following example.\n\n```\ncurl -X POST\nhttps://api.stripe.com/v1/quotes/qt_1HDGlYClCIKljWvsIGaAA06B/finalize \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\"\n```\n\n### Accept a quote\n\nYou can mark a quote as accepted only if it’s in the `open` status. Doing so\ntransitions the quote to the `accepted` status and creates the invoice,\nsubscription or subscription schedule.\n\nIf the quote doesn’t have a recurring price on any of its line items, a `draft`\ninvoice is created from the quote with `auto_advance` set to `false`. You can\nmake modifications to the invoice before finalizing and sending it to your\ncustomer for payment.\n\nIf the quote has at least one recurring price on a line item, then a\nsubscription or subscription schedule is created. A subscription schedule is\ncreated if the effective date on the quote is in the future, otherwise a\nsubscription is created. The first invoice on the subscription is in `draft`\nstatus with `auto_advance` set to `true`.\n\nIn the Dashboard, you can mark a quote as accepted through the **Convert to\ninvoice** and **Convert to subscription** buttons on the quote detail page. You\ncan mark a quote as accepted through the API as shown in the following example.\n\n```\ncurl -X POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/quotes/qt_1HDGlYClCIKljWvsIGaAA06B/accept\n\\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\"\n```\n\n### Cancel a quote\n\nYou can cancel a quote if its status is `draft` or `open`. Cancel a quote\nthrough the Dashboard on the quote detail page, or using the API as shown in the\nfollowing example.\n\n```\ncurl -X POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/quotes/qt_1HDGlYClCIKljWvsIGaAA06B/cancel\n\\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\"\n```\n\n### Download a quote’s PDF\n\nThe PDF method functions differently from the majority of the SDK methods you\nmight be accustomed to that typically return data in JSON format. Instead, the\nPDF method has a unique output.\n\nIt directly returns a stream of data that represents the byte sequences of the\nincoming data.\n\nIn effect, instead of waiting for the entire data set to load before it becomes\navailable, the byte stream can be read in ‘chunks’ or segments as the data\nstreams in.\n\nThis method is especially useful for handling large data or real-time data\nprocessing, where you can start processing incoming data before the entire data\nload is complete.\n\n```\ncurl https://files.stripe.com/v1/quotes/qt_0J1EnX589O8KAxCGEdmhZY3r/pdf \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\"\n```\n\n## Links\n\n- [Invoicing Plus](https://stripe.com/invoicing/pricing)\n- [is right for you](https://support.stripe.com/questions/how-to-access-quotes)\n- [invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n- [POST /v1/quotes/:id/cancel](https://docs.stripe.com/api/quotes/cancel)\n- [POST /v1/quotes/:id/finalize](https://docs.stripe.com/api/quotes/finalize)\n- [POST /v1/quotes/:id/accept](https://docs.stripe.com/api/quotes/accept)",
