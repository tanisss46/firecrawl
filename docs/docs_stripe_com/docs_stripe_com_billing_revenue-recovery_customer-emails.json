  "content": "# Automate customer emails\n\n## Learn how you can use customer emails to recover revenue.\n\nCustomer emails help prevent involuntary churn by notifying customers and giving\nthem a chance to intervene when churn is likely, like when a payment fails.\n\nEnable email notifications for all the use cases that make sense for your\nbusiness. We recommend you minimally provide a way for customers to:\n\n- [Confirm\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/revenue-recovery/customer-emails#payment-confirmation-notifications)\n- [Correct failed\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/revenue-recovery/customer-emails#failed-payment-notifications)\n\n## Configure emails\n\nYou can turn on customer emails in your [subscriptions and emails\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/automatic) Dashboard\nwithout writing any code. All of these emails and hosted pages use your\n[branding settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding).\n\nEmails for the following notification types include a link to a page where the\ncustomer can update their payment method.\n\n- Payment confirmation notifications\n- Failed payment notifications\n- Trial ending reminders\n- Renewal reminders\n- Expiring card notifications\n\nYou can set the link destination to your own custom link or [a Stripe-hosted\npage](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/revenue-recovery/customer-emails#link-to-a-stripe-hosted-page).\nIf you **Use your own custom link** and don’t provide a URL, we use your\nbusiness website.\n\n## Failed payment notifications\n\nNotify your customers about failed payments for subscriptions to encourage them\nto resolve the reason for failure, such as an expired card. Enable **Send emails\nwhen card payments fail** in the [revenue recovery\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/revenue_recovery/emails) page.\n\nWhen you enable this setting, Stripe automatically sends an email to your\ncustomer after each failed payment. The email lets your customer know that their\nrecent subscription payment failed and gives them the opportunity to update\ntheir payment method so it can be retried successfully.\n\n## Unpaid recurring invoice reminders\n\nTo send reminder emails about unpaid invoices, enable **Send reminders if a\nrecurring invoice hasn’t been paid** in the [billing settings\npage](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/automatic), in the **Manage\ninvoices sent to customers** section.\n\nThis sends payment reminders for recurring invoices with a collection method of\n[send_invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-collection_method)\non the configured schedule.\n\n## Trial ending reminders\n\nUnder [Manage free trial\nmessaging](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/automatic), turn on\n**Send a reminder email 7 days before a free trial ends** to send a trial ending\nreminder.\n\nWhen the trial ends without a payment method and the subscription is paused,\ncustomers can activate the subscription on the hosted page. They can add a\npayment method to activate the subscription and pay the first invoice.\n\n## Renewal reminders\n\nUnder [Prevent failed\npayments](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/automatic), turn on\n**Send emails about upcoming renewals**.\n\nStripe sends this email before the current renewal period ends based on the days\nconfigured in the **Upcoming renewal events** section.\n\nThe renewal date in the email uses the customer’s timezone. If the customer’s\ntimezone isn’t defined, it uses the timezone set in your [account\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/account). Otherwise, it defaults\nto UTC.\n\n## Payment confirmation notifications\n\nSome payments might require manual customer intervention, like those that use\n[3D Secure](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure) or the\n[Boleto](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/boleto/accept-a-payment) payment\nmethod. You can [manage payments that require\nconfirmation](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/automatic) in the\nDashboard.\n\n- To automatically send an email to your customer when their payment requires\nconfirmation, enable **Send a Stripe-hosted link for customers to confirm their\npayments when required**. The email includes a link to a Stripe-hosted page\nwhere your customer can confirm the payment.\n- To continue sending emails until your customer confirms the payment or it\nexpires, enable **Send reminders if payment confirmation isn’t completed**. You\ncan customize the intervals at which Stripe sends these reminders. Each reminder\nincludes a link similar to the original email where the customer can confirm the\npayment.\n\n## Expiring card notifications\n\nUnder [Prevent failed\npayments](https://dashboard.stripe.com/revenue_recovery/emails), turn on **Send\nemails about expiring cards**.\n\nThis automatically sends an email 1 month before your customer’s card on file\nexpires.\n\n## Link to a Stripe-hosted page\n\nWith the **Link to a Stripe-hosted page** option, Stripe provides a secure,\nprivate URL to a Stripe-hosted page in the email. Stripe doesn’t include a link\nto the Stripe-hosted page if the subscription is set to manually send an\ninvoice.\n\nOn that page, your customer can update their payment method for the relevant\nsubscription and pay any outstanding invoices if applicable. Otherwise, the new\npayment method is used the next time a scheduled payment is attempted.\n\nHow a customer updates their payment method on the Stripe-hosted page.\n\nAny of the following conditions invalidate the link to the hosted payment page:\n\n- It’s been 30 days since we sent the trial ending email.\n- The [subscription\nstatus](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview#subscription-statuses)\nchanges to `cancelled`, `incomplete_expired`, or `unpaid`.\n- The trial ended and the customer already provided a payment method for the\nsubscription.\n- The subscription’s current renewal period expired.\n\n## Test your configuration\n\nIn [test mode](https://docs.stripe.com/test-mode), Stripe doesn’t automatically\nsend customer emails. To test your customer email settings, use email addresses\nthat belong to your verified [email\ndomain](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/emails) or an active [team\nmember](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/team). If a test mode customer’s\nemail matches either of those conditions, Stripe sends failed payment\nnotifications, upcoming invoice reminders, trial ending reminders, and card\nexpiring reminders in test mode.\n\n## Email logs\n\nYou can find logs for emails sent within the last 30 days on the\n[customer](https://dashboard.stripe.com/customers) page. The logs are updated\ndaily, so they don’t include emails from the current date.\n\nWe log the following types of email notifications:\n\n- Failed payment attempts.\n- Finalized invoices.\n- Receipts for paid invoices.\n- Payments requiring 3D Secure.\n- Expiring cards on file.\n- Unpaid one-off invoices.\n- Created credit notes.\n- Issued refunds.\n- Ending subscription trials.\n- Canceled subscriptions.\n\n## Links\n\n- [subscriptions and emails\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/automatic)\n- [branding settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding)\n- [revenue recovery\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/revenue_recovery/emails)\n-\n[send_invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-collection_method)\n- [account settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/account)\n- [3D Secure](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure)\n- [Boleto](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/boleto/accept-a-payment)\n- [subscription\nstatus](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview#subscription-statuses)\n- [test mode](https://docs.stripe.com/test-mode)\n- [email domain](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/emails)\n- [team member](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/team)\n- [customer](https://dashboard.stripe.com/customers)",
