If you’re getting started with\nStripe Terminal, we recommend [viewing our current reader\nofferings](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/setup-reader).\n\n!\n\nThe Verifone P400 is a countertop reader for Stripe Terminal apps. It\n[connects](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/connect-reader?reader-type=internet)\nto the Stripe Terminal SDK over the internet.\n\nThis reader is compatible with JavaScript, iOS, Android, and React Native SDKs.\nTo view the reader’s parts and features, see the [product\nsheet](https://www.verifone.com/sites/default/files/2018-01/p400_datasheet_ltr_013018.pdf).\n\n## Turn the reader on and off\n\nTo turn on the Verifone P400, securely plug the P400 connector cable into the\nport on the bottom of the reader. The cover slides over the port to hold the\ncable in place. Plug the power adapter into the connector cable and into a power\noutlet.\n\n!\n\nVerifone P400 connector cable\n\nThe Verifone P400 automatically turns on when connected to power. In a\ncountertop deployment, leaving the device on for extended periods is expected.\nIf you need to turn the reader off, remove the power source.\n\n#### Note\n\nEven when it’s not in use, leave the Verifone P400 plugged in to receive\nautomatic software updates.\n\n## Connect the reader to the internet\n\nBecause the Verifone P400 is a smart reader, its reader software communicates\ndirectly with Stripe, managing connectivity through a LAN. The reader must\nconnect to the same local network as your application. If you’re running into\nissues connecting your reader to the internet follow the [troubleshooting\nsteps](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/readers/verifone-p400#troubleshooting)\nto diagnose the issue.\n\n### WiFi Preview\n\nIf you’re setting up a new device, follow the on-screen prompts to connect to\nthe internet using WiFi. To start over, press the red **X** button on the\nkeypad.\n\nTo switch networks, or connect an already online reader to a WiFi network, press\n**0WIFI** (**0-9-4-3-4**) on the keypad and follow the prompts. Attempting to\njoin a new network disconnects the reader from any existing wireless connection.\nThere’s no fallback to the previously connected network.\n\nYour WiFi network must use WPA-Personal or WPA2-Personal encryption and be\npassword protected. WiFi isn’t supported for non-password-protected networks or\nenterprise networks.\n\n#### Caution\n\nConnecting over WiFi is a beta feature. For production use, have an Ethernet\nconnection ready as a backup, in case of degraded networks or connectivity\nissues.\n\n#### Key mapping\n\nTo access characters from the keypad, use this multi-tap key mapping scheme. The\ntable shows which characters each key maps to, in the order they’ll appear.\n\nKeypad Number CharactersKeypad Number\nCharacters0`0-+=_!?@$%^&/\\()[]{}<>~|`6`6mnoMNO`1`1qz.QZ`7`7prsPRS`2`2abcABC`8`8tuvTUV`3`3defDEF`9`9wxyWXY`4`4ghiGHI`*`*,’␣”`:;`5`5jklJKL`#`#`\nFor example, if your network password is **Stripe**, enter\n`7-7-7-7-7-7-7-8-8-7-7-7-4-4-4-4-7-7-3-3-3`.\n\n### Ethernet\n\nConnect an Ethernet cable from your router to the Verifone P400, using the\n**ETH** port (not the **RS232** port).\n\n!\n\nConnecting Ethernet cable to Ethernet port\n\nThe reader obtains an IP address using DHCP. As soon as the network cable is\nplugged in, the reader attempts to establish communication with Stripe.\n\n### Network priority\n\nThe Verifone P400 resets its priority to Ethernet when rebooting. Even if\npreviously configured for WiFi, the reader switches to Ethernet if it detects an\nEthernet cable connection while starting up.\n\nIf you connect to WiFi while an Ethernet cable is connected, the reader switches\nto the WiFi connection. If the reader fails to connect to WiFi on the first\nattempt, it falls back to Ethernet connection. Otherwise, the reader continues\nto prioritize WiFi until rebooted.\n\n## Reader screens\n\nThe reader has a few screens to indicate its connectivity state. The default\nsplash screen indicates that the reader is connected to Stripe and ready for\nprocessing.\n\nYou can [customize the reader’s default splash\nscreen](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/fleet/splash-screen) by setting up\n[locations](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/fleet/locations-and-zones).\n\n!\n\nDefault splash screen\n\n!\n\nDownloading update screen\n\n!\n\nNot connected screen\n\n## Default reader language\n\nThe [Verifone P400](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/readers/verifone-p400)\ninterface displays text in both and the language of the region the\nreader is registered in.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Set up your\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/setup-integration)\n- [Verifone P400\nreference](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/readers/verifone-p400)\n\n## Links\n\n- [viewing our current reader\nofferings](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/setup-reader)\n-\n[connects](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/connect-reader?reader-type=internet)\n- [product\nsheet](https://www.verifone.com/sites/default/files/2018-01/p400_datasheet_ltr_013018.pdf)\n- [troubleshooting\nsteps](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/readers/verifone-p400#troubleshooting)\n- [customize the reader’s default splash\nscreen](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/fleet/splash-screen)\n- [locations](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/fleet/locations-and-zones)\n- [Verifone P400](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/readers/verifone-p400)\n- [Set up your\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/setup-integration)",
