  "content": "# Connect platforms can identify reused card or bank accounts across connected accounts as they now will share the same fingerprintBreaking changes\n\n## What’s new\n\nWhen viewed by a platform, cards and bank accounts created on behalf of\nconnected accounts now have a fingerprint that’s universal across all connected\naccounts. For accounts that aren’t connect platforms, there is no change.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis change provides platform users with a consistent fingerprint for cards and\nbank accounts across all connected accounts. It allows platforms to more easily\nidentify and track unique payment methods across their entire ecosystem of\nconnected accounts.\n\n## Upgrade\n\n- [View your current API\nversion](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#view-your-api-version-and-the-latest-available-upgrade-in-workbench)\nin Workbench.\n- If you use an SDK, upgrade to the corresponding SDK version for this API\nversion.- If you don’t use an SDK, update your [API\nrequests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/versioning) to include `Stripe-Version:\n2018-01-23`\n- Upgrade the API version used for [webhook\nendpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks/versioning).\n- [Test your integration](https://docs.stripe.com/testing) against the new\nversion.\n- If you use Connect, [test your Connect\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/testing).\n- In Workbench, [perform the\nupgrade](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#perform-the-upgrade).
