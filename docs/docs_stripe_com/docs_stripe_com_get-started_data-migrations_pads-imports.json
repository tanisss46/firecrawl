After\nyou collect customer agreement, this\n[mandate](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/acss-debit#mandates) gives your\nbusiness authorization to debit the customer’s bank account on a specified\nschedule. The mandate includes the customer’s institution number, transit\nnumber, account number, name and email.\n\nStripe can only import the PADs that you confirm you hold the mandates for.\nAfter determining mandate status for all, some, or none of the bank accounts,\ninform us so we can instruct you which steps to take next.\n\n## Migration Notification\n\nYou must notify your customers that you’re migrating payment processing to\nStripe.\n\n## Debiting PADs/ACSS\n\nIn our [intake form](https://support.stripe.com/contact/email?topic=migrations),\nchoose how you’ll debit the PADs:\n\n- **Only for automatic** use with invoices, subscriptions, or recurring payment\nschedules.\n- **Only for on-demand** customer-initiated payments.\n#### Note\n\nYou can’t debit these PADs for automatic use with invoices, subscriptions, or\nrecurring payment schedules.\n- **For both** on-demand customer-initiated payments and automatic use with\ninvoices, subscriptions, or recurring payment schedules.\n\n## PADs/ACSS file guidance\n\n- A processor can provide a number of different fields.\n- We advise your processor to provide a full export of all customer and payment\nmethod data to Stripe.\n- Stripe can filter out any unnecessary fields from the previous processor’s\ndata as needed.\n- Stripe can merge multiple received files if either the old customer ID or the\nold source ID is present in both files.\n- Stripe can only import PADs that are pre-authorized because verification is a\nrequirement of ACSS scheme rules.\n\n### File formatting requirements\n\nExport data files must meet the following data standards for us to proceed with\nan import:\n\n- The file must be in CSV format.\n- The file must be UTF-8 encoded.\n- Delimit rows by a single newline character `\n` (not `\\r\n`).\n- Delimit columns by `,`\n- You must wrap all fields containing commas in double quotes `\"`. We recommend\nwrapping all fields in double quotes.\n- Leave empty fields entirely empty (no character in between delimiters). You\nmust *not* denote a missing field with `NULL`, `N/A`, or any other value.\n- Escape any double quotes that are part of the content with another double\nquote per the CSV RFC. For example: `\"``William` `\"\"``Bard of Avon``\"\"`\n`Shakespeare``\"`\n- Fields can’t contain newline characters (`\\r` or `\n`) within a field. Example of what to avoid: `101 1st Ave\nApt 1`\n- All rows must have the same number of columns.\n- Columns support any order.\n- You must encrypt sensitive data files with our [PGP\nkey](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/data-migrations/pan-import#migration-pgp-key)\nbefore submitting through SFTP.\n\n## PADs/ACSS data fields\n\nFieldRequiredAdditional infoOld customer IDRequiredWe create a customer ID for\neach unique old customer ID provided.Institution NumberRequiredThe 3-digit\ninstitution number identifies your bank.Transit NumberRequiredThe transit number\n(5 digits) identifies the branch where you opened your account.Account\nNumberRequiredThe account number (11 digits) identifies your individual\naccount.EmailRequired/Optional1Additional metadata (Optional if full address is\nprovided instead).Address line 1Required/Optional1Additional metadata (Optional\nif email is provided instead).Address line 2Required/Optional1Additional\nmetadata (Optional if email is provided\ninstead).CityRequired/Optional1Additional metadata (Optional if email is\nprovided instead).StateRequired/Optional1Additional metadata (Optional if email\nis provided instead).PostalRequired/Optional1Additional metadata (Optional if\nemail is provided instead).CountryRequired/Optional1Additional metadata\n(Optional if email is provided instead).PhoneOptionalAdditional\nmetadataNameOptionalAdditional metadataStripe customer IDOptionalAdditional\nmetadataOld source IDOptionalAdditional metadataDescriptionOptionalAdditional\nmetadataCustomer metadataOptionalAny additional metadata\n1 Either the customer email address or their full address must be present within\nthe data file to import PADs/ACSS.
