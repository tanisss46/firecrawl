This\ndata can be helpful in optimizing your revenue recovery strategy and keeping\ntrack of changes in performance.\n\n#### Note\n\nData in the revenue recovery overview represents recurring subscription payments\nonly and excludes the first invoice payment following a trial.\n\n## Key performance indicators (KPIs)\n\n- **Failed payments:** The volume of subscription payments that failed on the\nfirst attempt. Use this metric to identify and monitor the volume of failed\npayments over time.\n- **Failure rate:** The percentage of subscription payment volume that failed on\nthe first attempt. If your failure rate is high, you can send proactive\nreminders ahead of payment dates to prevent failed payments.\n- **Recovered payments:** The volume of subscription payments recovered through\nretries or emails managed by Stripe, as well as other recovery methods you may\nbe using. Monitoring the volume of recovered payments can help you measure the\neffectiveness of your recovery strategies.\n- **Recovery rate:** The percentage of subscription payment volume successfully\nrecovered by any means after a failure. If your recovery rate is lower than\nexpected, consider turning on Stripe\n[retries](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/revenue-recovery/smart-retries) and\nfailed payment\n[emails](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/revenue-recovery/customer-emails).\n\n## Breakdowns\n\nThese are specific charts that provide more granular insights on payment\nfailures, recovery methods, and decline codes enabling you to tailor your\nrecovery strategies to fit your needs.\n\n### Recovery breakdown\n\n- **Not recovered:** The volume of subscription payments that failed and could\nnot be recovered.\n- **Recovered:** The volume of subscription payments recovered through retries\nor emails managed by Stripe, as well as other recovery methods you may be using.\nMonitoring the volume of recovered payments can help you measure the\neffectiveness of your recovery strategies.\n- **In recovery:** The volume of subscription payments that have recently failed\nbut are still being retried by Stripe. Youâ€™re likely to see payment volume in\nrecovery for the current month and the previous month as the retry window\nconcludes.\n- **Recovery rate:** The percentage of subscription payment volume that is\nsuccessfully recovered by any means after a failure. You may see a temporary\ndrop in your recovery rate for the current and previous month if not all\nautomatic retries have been attempted yet.\n\n### Recovered volume by method\n\n- **Retries:** The volume of failed payments recovered by Stripe retries.\n- **Emails:** The volume of failed payments recovered by Stripe emails.\n- **Other:** The volume of failed payments recovered by charge attempts made via\nAPI or in the Dashboard. Can include third-party email campaigns, in-app flows,\nother retry algorithms, and other recovery methods.\n\n### Failed volume by decline reason\n\nThis chart shows you the top five decline codes by failed payment volume.\nRecognizing the types of decline codes can help diagnose common issues and\npropose corrective measures to reduce failures. [Learn more about decline\ncodes](https://docs.stripe.com/declines/codes).\n\n## Top customers in recovery\n\nThis table showcases customers whose payments have recently failed and are still\nbeing attempted by Stripe. The table shows the failure amount and how long the\nsubscriber has been a customer. Consider reaching out to these customers\nmanually depending on their value to potentially save revenue.\n\n## Links\n\n- [revenue recovery overview](https://dashboard.stripe.com/revenue_recovery)\n- [retries](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/revenue-recovery/smart-retries)\n- [emails](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/revenue-recovery/customer-emails)\n- [Learn more about decline codes](https://docs.stripe.com/declines/codes)",
