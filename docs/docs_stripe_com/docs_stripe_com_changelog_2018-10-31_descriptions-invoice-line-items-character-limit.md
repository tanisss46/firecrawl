# Descriptions for invoice line items now have a character limitBreaking changes

## What’s new

The `description` field on invoice line items now has a maximum character length
limit of `500`.

## Impact

You must now ensure that line item descriptions are concise and within the 500
limit, potentially requiring the truncation or revision of longer descriptions.
