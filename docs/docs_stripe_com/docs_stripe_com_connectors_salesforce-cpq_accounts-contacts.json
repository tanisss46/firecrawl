  "content": "# Accounts and contacts\n\n## Learn about syncing the Stripe customer objects for your corresponding Salesforce accounts.\n\nAfter you set up the Stripe Billing Connector for Salesforce CPQ and [map your\ndata](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/salesforce-cpq/field-mappings), Stripe\ncreates a `Customer` object when an order finalizes. This happens when you\nassociate an account and a primary contact with a quote from an activated order.\n\nIf you use a parent-child hierarchy for your Salesforce accounts, make sure that\nonly the account that represents the billing entity (customer) correlates to an\nactivated order. Stripe Billing doesn’t currently support separate billing and\nprovisioning entities for subscriptions.\n\n## Field mappings for Stripe customers\n\nWhen you configure the connector to create a Stripe `Customer` object for each\nSalesforce account, there isn’t a default mapping to a primary contact or order\non the account. All customer fields are also optional.\n\nThe connector syncs a Salesforce account’s `Name` and `Description` fields to\nStripe. To sync additional fields, you can [add field\nmappings](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/salesforce-cpq/field-mappings) to\ncustomize the data that’s synced from Salesforce to Stripe.\n\nSalesforce field (Account object)Stripe\ncustomerNotesName[Name](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-name)Phone[Phone](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-phone)Description[Description](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-description)[Email](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-email)By\ndefault, the `Account` object in Salesforce doesn’t have an email field. You can\ncreate a subscription without a payment; however, you must supply an email\naddress for collections.Billing street[Address, line\n1](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-address-line1)This\naddress might affect the customer’s tax calculation, depending on your tax\nconfiguration. If the address is incomplete or differs from the billing address\non the quote or order, you must provide a custom mapping for this data.Billing\ncity[Address,\ncity](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-address-city)Billing\nstate[Address,\nstate](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-address-state)Billing\npostal code[Address, postal\ncode](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-address-postal_code)Billing\ncountry[Address,\ncountry](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-address-country)Phone[Shipping,\naddress,\nphone](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-phone)Shipping\nstreet[Shipping, address, line\n1](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-shipping-address-line1)Shipping\ncity[Shipping, address,\ncity](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-shipping-address-city)Shipping\nstate[Shipping, address,\nstate](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-shipping-address-state)Shipping\npostal code[Shipping, address, postal\ncode](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-shipping-address-postal_code)Shipping\ncountry[Shipping, address,\ncountry](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-shipping-address-country)\n## Update account data\n\nAccount and contact information sync in real time. When you create or update\naccounts in Salesforce, the connector creates and updates the Stripe `Customer`\nobjects with the latest information from Salesforce when an order syncs. Because\nSalesforce is the primary source for account and contact information, any\nupdates you make to a `Customer` object in Stripe aren’t synced to the\ncorresponding account in Salesforce.\n\nStripe doesn’t allow merging of accounts. If you want to merge any customers in\nSalesforce, you must do so before you sync the account to Stripe. `Customer`\nobjects synced to Stripe must have a valid ID in the Stripe ID field on the\naccount.\n\n## Delete accounts\n\nDeleting accounts or account information in Salesforce won’t affect the data in\nStripe. Any subscriptions in Stripe continue to bill and operate as normal. You\ncan’t delete Salesforce accounts with active subscriptions.\n\nDeleting a customer in Stripe is irreversible, cancels all subscriptions, and\ndeletes any saved payment methods. The best practice is to retain the customer\nunless you created it accidentally.\n\n## Merge accounts\n\nSalesforce allows you to merge up to three Salesforce accounts. Merging deletes\nthe dependent Salesforce accounts, and their dependent Salesforce records become\nthe primary Salesforce account’s records.\n\nThe connector doesn’t sync these changes into Stripe. Any Stripe subscriptions\nthat belong to the deleted Salesforce account still belong to the original\nStripe customer that corresponds to the deleted Salesforce account.\n\n#### Note\n\nThe child account is the account that’s merged into the primary account.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Field defaults and custom\nmappings](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/salesforce-cpq/field-mappings)\n\n## Links\n\n- [map your\ndata](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/salesforce-cpq/field-mappings)\n- [Name](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-name)\n- [Phone](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-phone)\n-\n[Description](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-description)\n- [Email](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-email)\n- [Address, line\n1](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-address-line1)\n- [Address,\ncity](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-address-city)\n- [Address,\nstate](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-address-state)\n- [Address, postal\ncode](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-address-postal_code)\n- [Address,\ncountry](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-address-country)\n- [Shipping, address, line\n1](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-shipping-address-line1)\n- [Shipping, address,\ncity](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-shipping-address-city)\n- [Shipping, address,\nstate](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-shipping-address-state)\n- [Shipping, address, postal\ncode](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-shipping-address-postal_code)\n- [Shipping, address,\ncountry](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-shipping-address-country)",
