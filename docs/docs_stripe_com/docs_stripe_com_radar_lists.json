  "content": "# Lists\n\n## Create your own lists of information to block, allow, or review matching payments.\n\nUsers of Stripe Radar for Fraud Teams can create lists of specific types of\ninformation and use them in [rules](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules). For\nexample, you might want to create rules using a list of:\n\n- **Customer IDs for trusted customers**. Use this list to automatically allow\npayments by these customers.\n- **Email addresses you tied to fraud**. Automatically block any payment with an\nemail address on this list.\n- **Suspicious IP addresses**. Place payments into review that have a matching\nIP address.\n\nLists make rules more manageable. Instead of creating individual rules for one\nitem at a time, you can add similar types of information to a list (for example,\nemail addresses) for a rule to use automatically.\n\n## Default lists\n\nStripe Radar includes a set of default lists to help you get started. Each of\nthe following types of information has a separate allow and block list that your\n[default allow and block rules](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules) can\nreference.\n\n- **Card BIN**\n\nThe Bank Identification Number (BIN) of the card being used to make the payment.\nThis is the first six digits of the card number (for example, `424242`).\n- **Card country**\n\nThe two-letter code corresponding to the country where the card was issued (for\nexample, `US`).\n- **Card fingerprint**\n\nThe [fingerprint](https://docs.stripe.com/api#card_object-fingerprint) of the\ncard being used to make the payment. The card fingerprint is a unique Stripe\nidentifier of a particular card number (for example, eRL25uIvx8P3U4). It’s a\nproperty of the [Card](https://docs.stripe.com/api#card_object) object and you\ncan see it in the Dashboard when viewing a payment.\n- **Charge description**\n\nThe [description](https://docs.stripe.com/api#charge_object-description)\nsupplied with the payment.\n- **Client IP country**\n\nThe two-letter code corresponding to the country-level geolocation of the IP\naddress where the payment originates (for example, `GB`).\n- **Client IP address**\n\nThe IP address from which the payment originates (for example,\n`13.112.224.240`).\n- **Customer ID**\n\nThe [customer ID](https://docs.stripe.com/api#charge_object-customer) supplied\nwith the payment (for example, `cus_AeFLnRaI51AbRi`).\n- **Email**\n\nThe first email derived from the charge, card, or customer objects, in that\norder (for example, `jenny.rosen@example.com`).\n- **Email domain**\n\nThe first email domain derived from the `Charge`, `Card`, or `Customer` objects,\nin that order (for example, `example.com`).\n\n#### Note\n\nYou can add and remove items from these lists but you can’t edit or remove the\ndefault lists themselves.\n\n## Custom lists\n\nYou can create lists of your own that contain items that are a specific type of\ninformation. The types of lists you can create are:\n\n- String\n- Case-sensitive string\n- Card fingerprint\n- Card BIN\n- Customer ID\n- Email\n- IP address\n- Country\n\nUse the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/radar/lists) or the\n[API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/radar/value_lists/create) to create lists. To\ncreate a new list in the Dashboard:\n\n- Click **New**.\n- Enter a name for the list (we automatically generate an alias to use as a\nreference when writing rules, but you can override this).\n- Select the type of list to create.\n- Click **Add** to save your new list.\n\nAfter creating your new list, [add a new\nrule](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules/reference#lists) that references it.\n\nYou can edit or remove lists you’ve created by clicking the overflow menu\n(**•••**), and you can edit the list directly by clicking the name of the list.\n\n## Managing list items\n\nYou can view and remove items when viewing a list in the\n[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/radar/lists). Each item includes\ninformation about when it was added and by whom. You can filter items by value,\nauthor, and date added. Each list can contain up to 50,000 items.\n\nYou can add items to your default block list by [refunding and reporting a\npayment as\nfraudulent](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/risk-evaluation#feedback-on-risk-evaluations).\nDoing so takes the following actions:\n\n- Adds the card fingerprint to your default card fingerprint block list. If the\npayment is made using a [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api#customer_object)\nobject, it adds the card fingerprints of any other cards also added to the list.\n- Adds any email address associated with the payment to your default email block\nlist. It takes the email address from:- The `receipt_email` of the payment\n- The `email` of the `Customer` object that the payment was created on\n- Any email addresses found in the customer or payment `description` fields, and\nin the card’s `name` field\n\nWhen refunding a payment because of suspected fraud, make sure to specify this\nreason to help our machine learning systems recognize similar cases in the\nfuture.\n\nYou can also make a [charge\nupdate](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/update#update_charge-fraud_details)\nrequest using the API and set `fraud_details.user_report` to `fraudulent`. This\nalso adds any associated cards and email addresses to your card fingerprint and\nemail block lists.\n\nWhen adding string list items in the Dashboard, you have the option of selecting\nthe length of time before expiration. These items are only active in the list\nfor as long as you specify. After they expire, they’re no longer active in rule\nevaluation.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Rules](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules)\n\n## Links\n\n- [rules](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules)\n- [fingerprint](https://docs.stripe.com/api#card_object-fingerprint)\n- [Card](https://docs.stripe.com/api#card_object)\n- [description](https://docs.stripe.com/api#charge_object-description)\n- [customer ID](https://docs.stripe.com/api#charge_object-customer)\n- [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/radar/lists)\n- [API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/radar/value_lists/create)\n- [add a new rule](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules/reference#lists)\n- [refunding and reporting a payment as\nfraudulent](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/risk-evaluation#feedback-on-risk-evaluations)\n- [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api#customer_object)\n- [charge\nupdate](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/update#update_charge-fraud_details)",
