# Ending a subscription trial now uses the timestamp of that API requestBreaking changes

## What’s new

When ending a trial on a subscription using `trial_end=now`, the updated
subscription now receives a `trial_end` timestamp from the time of the request
rather than being unset.

## Impact

Providing a precise `trial_end` timestamp when ending a subscription trial using
`trial_end=now` lets you track exactly when a trial was ended. This improves
accuracy in subscription lifecycle management, but might require updates to code
that processes trial end events.
