To finalize, download, or accept quotes in live\nmode for one-time invoices through the API or Dashboard, you must upgrade to\n[Invoicing Plus](https://stripe.com/invoicing/pricing). See which plan [is right\nfor you](https://support.stripe.com/questions/how-to-access-quotes).\n\nDashboardAPI\nA quote is a way to show prospective or existing customers the costs for a set\nof products and services. Quotes show the cost of either a one-off\n[invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices) or\n[subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating). When a\ncustomer accepts the quote, ​​Stripe automatically creates all relevant invoices\nand subscriptions. ​​Many sales workflows use this common tool.\n\n[Create a quote](https://docs.stripe.com/quotes/create#create-quote-dashboard)\nTo create a quote in the Stripe Dashboard:\n\n- Go to the [Billing tab](https://dashboard.stripe.com/billing).\n- Click **Quick actions** > **Create quote** (or go directly to the [quote\neditor](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/quotes/create)).\n- Select **+ Add new customer**. At a minimum, enter your customer’s **Name**\nand **Account email**. Click **Add customer**.\n- Under **Items**, add or select a product. (You can also add a coupon.)\n- Choose an expiration date.\n- (Optional) Write a memo, and add a custom header and footer. You can set the\nfuture default text for the header and footer in the [quote\ntemplate](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/quote).\n- To preview the quote PDF (which shows the generated quote number) click\n**Download preview**.\n- Click **Finalize quote**.\n\n![Quote\neditor](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/create-quote-editor.b0567a67946f35c4844e0979f2bc7019.png)\n\nQuote editor\n\nAfter you finalize the quote, send it to your customer:\n\n- To download the quote, go to **Quotes details page** > **Quote PDF**.\n- Use an external email address to send the PDF to your customer for review.\n[Mark a quote as\naccepted](https://docs.stripe.com/quotes/create#accept-quote-dashboard)\nAfter your customer accepts the quote, bill them by converting the quote into an\ninvoice or subscription.\n\nYou can only create one-off invoices if a quote *only* has one-time prices.\n\nIf a quote has at least one recurring price, you can only convert it to a\nsubscription.\n\n### Convert a quote to an invoice\n\n- To mark a quote as accepted and create a draft invoice, go to **Convert to\ninvoice** > **Quotes details**.\n- Use the [invoice editor](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/invoices/create) to\nmodify the draft invoice as needed.\n- Email the invoice or automatically charge the customer.\n\n### Convert a quote to a subscription\n\n- In the quote editor, choose a customer and create or select a product with a\nrecurring price.\n- Enter the quote details and choose to either **Start the subscription\nimmediately** or **Schedule a subscription start date**.\n- Finalize the quote. This marks the quote as **Accepted**.\n- Go to **Convert to subscription** > **Quotes details**.\n- Enter or modify the subscription details, then click **Create subscription**.\n\nIf you schedule the subscription to start immediately, Stripe creates an active\nsubscription along with a draft invoice for the initial payment. Stripe\nfinalizes the draft invoice automatically in 1 hour. Otherwise, the subscription\nbegins on the scheduled start date. Depending on the subscription’s payment\nterms, Stripe collects payment by either charging the customer’s payment method\non file or sending them an invoice.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Invoicing Plus](https://stripe.com/invoicing/pricing)\n- [is right for you](https://support.stripe.com/questions/how-to-access-quotes)\n- [invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n- [subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating)\n- [Billing tab](https://dashboard.stripe.com/billing)\n- [quote editor](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/quotes/create)\n- [quote template](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/quote)\n- [invoice editor](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/invoices/create)",
