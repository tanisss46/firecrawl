  "content": "# Renames and updates subscription schedule renewal propertiesBreaking changes\n\n## What’s new\n\nIncludes multiple changes to subscription schedules:\n\n- Renames `renewal_behavior` to `end_behavior`, and `cancel` and `release`\nvalues.\n- Removes `renewal_interval`.\n\nA side effect of this change is that if you wrote a `renewal_behavior` of `none`\non an old API version, `end_behavior` is now converted to `cancel` when reading\nthe value back. In the event that you’re upgrading your API and set\n`renewal_behavior` as `renew`, with this API version enabled, you’ll see\n`end_behavior` as `renew`. However, you can no longer update `renewal_interval`,\nor set `end_behavior` to `renew`, as it’s in a read-only state.\n\n## Impact\n\nLets you more intuitively control how a subscription schedule ends using the\n`end_behavior` property. The change handles backward compatibility by\nautomatically mapping the old `renewal_behavior` value of `none` to the new\ncancel end behavior.\n\n## Upgrade\n\n- [View your current API\nversion](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#view-your-api-version-and-the-latest-available-upgrade-in-workbench)\nin Workbench.\n- If you use an SDK, upgrade to the corresponding SDK version for this API\nversion.- If you don’t use an SDK, update your [API\nrequests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/versioning) to include `Stripe-Version:\n2019-10-17`\n- Upgrade the API version used for [webhook\nendpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks/versioning).\n- [Test your integration](https://docs.stripe.com/testing) against the new\nversion.\n- If you use Connect, [test your Connect\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/testing).\n- In Workbench, [perform the\nupgrade](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#perform-the-upgrade).
