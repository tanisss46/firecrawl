It sets the day\nof week for `week` intervals, the day of month for `month` and `year` intervals,\nand the month of year for `year` intervals. The default value is either the\nsubscription creation date or the trial end date (if you’re using a trial\nperiod). You can also explicitly set this value at the time you create the\nsubscription.\n\n#### Note\n\nBilling cycle anchors are UNIX timestamps in seconds from the current epoch.\n\nThe following are examples of monthly subscriptions with different billing\ncycles:\n\n- A monthly subscription with a billing cycle anchor date of September 2 always\nbills on the 2nd day of the month.\n- A monthly subscription with a billing cycle anchor date of January 31 bills\nthe last day of the month closest to the anchor date, so February 28 (or\nFebruary 29 in a leap year), then March 31, April 30, and so on.\n- A weekly subscription with a billing cycle anchor date of Friday, June 3 bills\nevery Friday thereafter.\n\nFull billing periods start on the first full\n[invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices) date, which is often the same as\nthe billing cycle anchor and is always interval-aligned with it.\n\n## Specify the billing cycle anchor for new subscriptions\n\n#### Note\n\nThe subscription creation time matches the time of the request. It is not the\nsame as the subscription start date. Learn more about [backdating and billing\ncycle\nanchors](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/backdating#backdating-billing-cycle).\n\nThere are two ways to set the billing cycle anchor on new subscriptions:\n\n- Use `billing_cycle_anchor_config` to calculate the timestamp for you (monthly\nor yearly subscriptions only).\n- Use `billing_cycle_anchor` to accept the timestamp directly.\n\nIf you’re creating a monthly or yearly subscription, we recommend using the\n`billing_cycle_anchor_config` parameter because it automatically factors in\nshort months and leap years for you. If you’re creating a daily or weekly\nsubscription, or if you prefer to set the cycle date of your subscription using\na timestamp, use the `billing_cycle_anchor` parameter directly.\n\n### Use billing_cycle_anchor_config\n\nTo create an integration with monthly and yearly subscriptions, use\n`billing_cycle_anchor_config` on [create\nsubscription](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_subscription) to specify the\nday of the month on which to anchor.\n\nSet `day_of_month` to `31` to create a monthly subscription that cycles at the\nend of the month, even in months with less than 31 days. If a month has less\nthan 31 days, the subscription cycles on the last day of that month.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscriptions \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d customer={{CUSTOMER_ID}} \\\n -d \"items[0][price]\"={{PRICE_ID}} \\\n -d \"billing_cycle_anchor_config[day_of_month]\"=31\n```\n\nYou can also specify `month` to control the month of year for the anchor on\nmulti-month and yearly subscriptions.\n\nTo cycle your yearly subscriptions on the first of July, create a yearly\nsubscription with a `month` of `7` and `day_of_month` of `1`.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscriptions \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d customer={{CUSTOMER_ID}} \\\n -d \"items[0][price]\"={{PRICE_ID}} \\\n -d \"billing_cycle_anchor_config[month]\"=7 \\\n -d \"billing_cycle_anchor_config[day_of_month]\"=1\n```\n\nYou can specify the exact month, day, hour, minute, and second for the billing\ncycle anchor by using `billing_cycle_anchor_config`. If you don’t specify the\nhour, minute, and second, they default to the values of the subscription\ncreation time.\n\nThe billing cycle anchor uses Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). For example, if\nyou create a subscription using `billing_cycle_anchor_config` at 5 PM EST\nwithout specifying the hour, the time is recorded in the system as 10 PM UTC.\n\n`billing_cycle_anchor_config` does not support anchoring on a backdated start\ndate.\n\nFor example, if you have an existing monthly subscription with a\n`billing_cycle_anchor` timestamp that contains the day of the month, hour,\nminute, and second of 15, 12, 30, and 0, you can align a new monthly\nsubscription with it. To do this, set `day_of_month`, `hour`, `minute`, and\n`second` to match those same values, respectively.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscriptions \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d customer={{CUSTOMER_ID}} \\\n -d \"items[0][price]\"={{PRICE_ID}} \\\n -d \"billing_cycle_anchor_config[day_of_month]\"=15 \\\n -d \"billing_cycle_anchor_config[hour]\"=12 \\\n -d \"billing_cycle_anchor_config[minute]\"=30 \\\n -d \"billing_cycle_anchor_config[second]\"=0\n```\n\nIf you use `billing_cycle_anchor_config`, it might result in a\n`billing_cycle_anchor` that’s more than one billing period in the future.\nHowever, the date for the first full invoice always falls within one billing\nperiod from the creation of the subscription or the ending of a free trial.\n\nFor example, assume that you create a two-month interval subscription in\nFebruary and you cycle it at the end of every month by setting `day_of_month` to\n`31`. The next month that has 31 days on two-month intervals from February is\nAugust, which results in a billing cycle anchor on August 31. However, the first\nfull invoice date for this subscription still occurs in February. There’s an\ninitial, prorated period from subscription creation until February 28 (or 29\nduring a leap year), followed by a full two-month billing period.\n\n### Use billing_cycle_anchor\n\nYou can create a subscription with an explicit billing cycle anchor using the\nSubscriptions API or Checkout.\n\nSubscriptions APICheckout\nCall [create subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_subscription),\nsetting a timestamp for `billing_cycle_anchor`.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscriptions \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d customer={{CUSTOMER_ID}} \\\n -d \"items[0][price]\"={{PRICE_ID}} \\\n -d billing_cycle_anchor=1611008505\n```\n\n### Configure proration behavior\n\nRegardless of which API parameter you use, Stripe automatically creates a\nprorated invoice to bill for the period between the subscription creation date\nand the first full invoice date.\n\nIf you don’t want to immediately charge a customer for the period between the\nsubscription creation and the first full invoice date, either:\n\n- [Disable the\nproration](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/prorations#disable-prorations)\nby setting `proration_behavior` to `none`, making the initial period up to the\nfirst full invoice date free. This action doesn’t generate an invoice at all\nuntil the first billing cycle.\n- [Combine a trial with the\nbilling_cycle_anchor](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/trials#combine-trial-anchor)\nby setting `trial_end` to a timestamp representing the date when the free trial\nends. Depending on the duration of the free trial and the number of days until\nthe first full invoice date, this option might result in a prorated invoice\nfollowing the trial period. For example, a free trial is 7 days and the billing\ncycle is monthly on the 1st. If the customer subscribes on the 15th, we generate\na prorated invoice on the 22nd for the period between the 22nd and the 1st, then\ninvoice for the full amount on the 1st of each month thereafter. If a customer\nsubscribes on the 28th, the free trial extends past the 1st, generating a\nprorated invoice until the next month.\n\n## Change the billing cycle on pre-existing subscriptions\n\nUse the [Subscriptions API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/update) or\n[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/subscriptions) to change the billing\ndate of an existing subscription through one of the following options:\n\n- Reset the billing cycle anchor to the current time.\n- Add a [free trial](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/trials) to\nautomatically set the anchor date to the end of the trial. Trials typically\nstart when you create a subscription, but you can also apply them to existing\nsubscriptions, allowing you to credit the customer for the days left in the\nprevious cycle that they already paid.\n- If all the prices are zero-amount, adding one or more paid prices immediately\nresets the billing period. See the [upgrade and downgrade\nguide](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/upgrade-downgrade#handling-zero-amount-prices-and-quantities)\nfor more details on this scenario.\n\n### Reset the billing cycle to the current time\n\nTo reset the billing cycle anchor, make an update request request with\n`billing_cycle_anchor` set to `now`. This sets the billing cycle anchor to the\ntime of the update request. When you reset the billing cycle anchor, Stripe\nimmediately sends an invoice. [Enable\nproration](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/create#create_subscription-proration_behavior)\nto credit the customer for any days already paid in the previous period.\nDisabling proration might result in overcharging your customer.\n\nAPIDashboard\nCall [update the subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/api#update_subscription),\nsetting `billing_cycle_anchor` to `now` and `proration_behavior` to\n`create_prorations` to prevent overcharging the customer for any days they\nalready paid in the previous cycle.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscriptions/sub_49ty4767H20z6a \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d billing_cycle_anchor=now \\\n -d proration_behavior=create_prorations\n```\n\n### Add a trial to change the billing cycle\n\nAdding a non-prorated trial period to an existing subscription allows you to\nconfigure the billing cycle to be any date.\n\nTypically, if you’re using the trial period to change the billing cycle without\nissuing a prorated invoice, you disable proration because the length of the\ntrial period accounts for the portion already paid from the previous billing\ncycle.\n\nFor example, if a customer has an active subscription set to bill next on July\n23, and you introduce a trial period until August 1:\n\n- The customer receives a 0 USD invoice on July 15.\n- The customer isn’t billed on July 23.\n- The customer is billed next on August 1, then on September 1, and so on.\n- The customer already paid through July 23 in the previous cycle, so that\n“free” period isn’t actually free.\n- The period between July 23 and July 31 isn’t charged.\n- The new cycle billed on August 1 is a full cycle at the normal rate.\nAPIDashboard\nCall [update subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/api#update_subscription),\nsetting `trial_end` to a Unix timestamp representing the end date for the trial\n(also the new billing cycle anchor) and `proration_behavior` to `none`.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscriptions/sub_49ty4767H20z6a \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d trial_end=1611008505 \\\n -d proration_behavior=none\n```\n\n## Metered billing\n\nWith [metered billing](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models),\nthe price paid by the customer varies based on consumption during the billing\ncycle. When changing the billing cycle results in ending a subscription interval\nearly, you charge the customer for the usage accrued during the shortened\nbilling cycle.\n\n### Thresholds\n\nIn addition to the regular cycle, you can configure subscriptions to bill\nwhenever the amount due reaches a\n[threshold](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based/alerts-and-thresholds#billing-thresholds).\n\nIf you have a subscription configured to invoice this way, you can set it up to\nreset the subscription cycle when it hits the threshold.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Using trial periods](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/trials)\n- [Update Subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/api#update_subscription)\n\n## Links\n\n- [price](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/overview)\n- [billing cycle\nanchor](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-billing_cycle_anchor)\n- [invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n- [backdating and billing cycle\nanchors](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/backdating#backdating-billing-cycle)\n- [create subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_subscription)\n- [Disable the\nproration](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/prorations#disable-prorations)\n- [Combine a trial with the\nbilling_cycle_anchor](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/trials#combine-trial-anchor)\n- [Subscriptions API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/update)\n- [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/subscriptions)\n- [free trial](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/trials)\n- [upgrade and downgrade\nguide](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/upgrade-downgrade#handling-zero-amount-prices-and-quantities)\n- [Enable\nproration](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/create#create_subscription-proration_behavior)\n- [update the subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/api#update_subscription)\n- [metered billing](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models)\n-\n[threshold](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based/alerts-and-thresholds#billing-thresholds)",
