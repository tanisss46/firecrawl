If you want to view analytics specifically for card payments, see\n[Acceptance analytics](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/analytics/acceptance).\n\n#### Public preview\n\n[Payments analytics](https://dashboard.stripe.com/acceptance) is in public\npreview. If you’re not part of the public preview, you can still access these\nanalytics by navigating to **Reporting** > **Reports** > **Payment methods** in\nthe Dashboard. If you want access to the public preview, you can [join the\nwaitlist](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/analytics).\n\n## Configure your data set\n\nUse filters to control all of the metrics, charts, and tables on this page.\n\n### Specify payment method\n\nThis page displays metrics, charts, and tables specific to a single payment\nmethod. The `Payment methods` filter is set to the payment method with the\nhighest payment volume in the last four weeks by default.\n\n![Payment methods\nfilter](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/filter.d4766f7b745d5444a09de91a2935beea.png)\n\nPayment methods filter\n\nTo change the payment method, select the payment method you want from the list.\nYou only see payment methods with previous payment activity. You can view which\npayment methods you’ve configured in\n[Settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods).\n\n### Specify currency\n\nWhen you don’t apply a currency filter, all payments are shown and converted to\nyour default settlement currency, regardless of whether the original payment was\nin a different currency. If you apply a currency filter, you only see data for\npayments made in the selected currency. To change the currency, click\n**Currency** , and select the currency you want from the list.\n\n### Specify Connect\n\nBy default, metrics include charge activity for all of your connected accounts.\nUse the `Connected accounts` filter if you want to exclude data from your\nconnected accounts. Data from [Standard connected\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/accounts#standard-accounts) is only\nvisible if you enable [Platform\ncontrols](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/platform-controls-for-stripe-dashboard-accounts).\n\n## Download data\n\nTo download these analytics, click **Download** at the top of each chart. The\nCSV file you download matches any filters you selected, or matches your defaults\nif you apply no filters.\n\n## Key metrics\n\nThese metrics include all payments that were accepted for the selected payment\nmethod. You can view both the number of accepted payments and payment volume for\nyour selected period. These metrics don’t currently support data related to\nfailed, pending, or blocked payments.\n\n## Average order value\n\nThe average order value (AOV) is the average amount a customer spends per\naccepted payment. This chart can help you identify which specific payment\nmethods drive incremental spend by your customers. For example, [Buy Now Pay\nLater](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/buy-now-pay-later) methods might\nencourage higher spending by allowing customers to pay over time. Tracking AOV\nover time might also help reveal trends in customer spending behavior. To\ncalculate the AOV, divide the total revenue for a given period (day, week,\nmonth, and so on) by the total number of accepted payments in the same period.\n\n## Payment method share\n\nPayment method share refers to the distribution of different payment methods\nused by customers within a given time period (such as a day, week, or month).\nThis metric helps you understand the frequency that your customers choose\ncertain payment methods. Tracking the share over time allows you to analyze\nshifts in customer preferences between payment methods. Stripe calculates\npayment method share in two ways:\n\n- **Share of payments**: The total number of accepted payments made using the\npayment method, divided by the total number of accepted payments in the same\nperiod.\n- **Share of volume**: The total amount of accepted payment volume processed\nusing the payment method, divided by the total accepted payment volume in the\nsame period.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Glossary](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/analytics/glossary)\n- [Acceptance analytics](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/analytics/acceptance)\n- [Authentication\nanalytics](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/analytics/authentication)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Payment Methods](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payment-methods)\n- [Link](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link)\n- [Buy now, pay later](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/buy-now-pay-later)\n- [Acceptance analytics](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/analytics/acceptance)\n- [Payments analytics](https://dashboard.stripe.com/acceptance)\n- [join the waitlist](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/analytics)\n- [Settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods)\n- [Standard connected\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/accounts#standard-accounts)\n- [Platform\ncontrols](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/platform-controls-for-stripe-dashboard-accounts)\n- [Glossary](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/analytics/glossary)\n- [Authentication\nanalytics](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/analytics/authentication)",
