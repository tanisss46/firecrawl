# Save and retrieve customer payment methods

## Learn more about saved payment methods in the Payment Element.

You can save customer payment methods on the [Customer
object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers) for future use with the Payment
Element’s Saved Payment Method feature. This enables you to:

- Prompt buyers for
[consent](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web&ui=elements#save-payment-methods)
to save payment methods, such as `card`, `us_bank_account`, and `sepa_debit`.
- Save payment methods when buyers provide GDPR-compliant consent for both
one-time payments and recurring transactions.
- Display saved payment methods to buyers for future purchases. Customers can
also remove and update their payment information.
- Configure the Payment Element to require CVC re-collection for a given
transaction.

To integrate saved payment methods on the Payment Element, first learn to
[Design an
integration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element/design-an-integration)
if you’re new to using the Payment Element. If you have an existing Payment
Element integration, look for the **Save and retrieve customer payment methods**
step in the integration guide you followed to enable saved payment methods.

## Use saved payment methods with Link

[Link](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link) is a network of saved payment
methods that work across all Stripe users. You can use Link with Saved Payment
Methods without any additional configuration.

- New customers can save their payment method to a specific business, Link, or
both.
- Customers who have both a saved Link payment method and a saved business
payment method see their business saved payment method displayed after the page
loads.

Reuse a previously saved payment method.

## Re-collect payment details

For additional security, you can specify
[require_cvc_recollection](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-payment_method_options-card-require_cvc_recollection)
to request the Payment Element to re-collect a CVC when a customer is paying
with a card.

```
payment_method_options: {
 card: {required_cvc_recollection: true}
}
```

## Save a payment method for a subscription or recurring transaction

If the **Save payment details for future purchases** checkbox appears and is
selected when you’re confirming a payment, the payment method’s
[allow_redisplay](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object#payment_method_object-allow_redisplay)
value is set to `always`. This means the customer consents to use the payment
method for the subscription and future sessions. If the customer leaves the
checkbox unselected, the `allow_redisplay` value is set to `limited`. This means
you can’t use the payment method for future purchases — it’s limited to the
current subscription you’re setting up.

## Prevent payment method removal from subscriptions

If a payment method is saved for reuse and is also the payment method for an
ongoing subscription, removing that payment method from the Payment Element’s
**Saved** section also removes it from the subscription. We recommend that you
[disable
removing](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_sessions/object#customer_session_object-components-payment_element-features-payment_method_remove)
saved payment methods from the Payment Element to avoid removing a payment
method from an active subscription. Instead, manage payment methods in an
account settings or similar page that shows existing subscriptions.

## Display existing saved payment methods

If existing payment methods are attached to customers in your Stripe account
from a Card Element integration, direct use of the Stripe API, or some other
method, those payment methods won’t render in the Payment Element as their
`allow_redisplay` property is `unspecified`. If the `allow_redisplay` property
is `always`, the payment method renders in the Payment Element.

You can use one of the following methods to display previously saved payment
methods:

- If you collected the proper consent from the customer when saving the payment
method, update `allow_redisplay` to `always`.- Use the [Payment Method update
API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/update) to update an individual
payment method.
- Configure the [Customer Session
API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_sessions/object#customer_session_object-components-payment_element-features-payment_method_allow_redisplay_filters)
to include payment methods where `allow_redisplay="unspecified"`.

## Collect consent to reuse a payment method outside of the Payment Element

The Payment Element uses the state of the **Save payment details for future
purchases** checkbox to determine when a customer has given consent to save a
payment method. If you’re collecting this consent a different way (such as with
the terms and conditions of your website or consent text rendered outside of the
Payment Element), you can override the consent that the Elements instance
provides when confirming the intent.

If your integration uses
[stripe.confirmPayment](https://docs.stripe.com/js/payment_intents/confirm_payment),
[stripe.confirmSetup](https://docs.stripe.com/js/setup_intents/confirm_setup),
or
[stripe.createConfirmationToken](https://docs.stripe.com/js/confirmation_tokens/create_confirmation_token),
pass an explicit
[allow_redisplay](https://docs.stripe.com/js/payment_intents/confirm_payment#confirm_payment_intent-options-confirmParams-payment_method_data-allow_redisplay)
value into the options hash to override the value from the Elements instance.
