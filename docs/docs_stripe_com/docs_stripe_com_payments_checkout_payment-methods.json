To enable and\nmanage your payment method preferences, go to the\n[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods). Stripe\nenables certain payment methods for you by default and might enable additional\npayment methods after notifying you.\n\n## Manually specify payment methods\n\nYou can override Dashboard settings by manually specifying\n[payment_method_types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-payment_method_types)\nwhen creating the Checkout Session. Unless your integration requires that you\nlist payment methods manually, we recommend that you manage payment methods from\nthe [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods).\n\nIf multiple payment methods are passed, Stripe dynamically reorders them to\nprioritize the most relevant payment methods based on the customerâ€™s location\nand other characteristics.\n\n[Learn about payment methodsExplore the available options for global payment\nmethods.](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/overview)[Add\none-click payment buttonsUse one-click payment options, such as Apple Pay or\nGoogle Pay.](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/one-click-payment-buttons)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods)\n-\n[payment_method_types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-payment_method_types)\n- [Learn about payment methodsExplore the available options for global payment\nmethods.](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/overview)\n- [Add one-click payment buttonsUse one-click payment options, such as Apple Pay\nor Google Pay.](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/one-click-payment-buttons)",
