Sales to business\ncustomers in Kazakhstan don’t trigger any tax registration obligations because\nnon-resident businesses aren’t required to collect tax on these sales.\n\n- **Threshold**: 1 transaction\n- **Included transactions**: Business-to-consumer (B2C) sales of digital goods\nor electronically supplied services (digital products)\n\n## Register to collect tax\n\nYou must be a remote seller with no physical presence in Kazakhstan to collect\nthis tax on Stripe.\n\nFind more information on how to register for VAT in Kazakhstan on the\n[government\nwebsite](https://kgd.gov.kz/en/content/taxation-foreign-companies-engaged-electronic-trade-goods-and-provision-electronic-services).\n\nAfter you’ve registered to collect tax in Kazakhstan, go to\n[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations?location=kz) to\nadd your registrations to Stripe in the Dashboard.
