The difference between issuing\na credit note and adjusting the amount of an invoice by [revising\nit](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/invoice-edits) is that a credit note\ndoesn’t void and replace the original invoice. Some example scenarios where you\nmight use credit notes include:\n\n- **You accidentally overbilled a customer**—You accidentally charged your\ncustomer 110 USD instead of 100 USD because of a data entry mistake. Use a\ncredit note to give your customer a 10 USD credit for the overcharge.\n- **You’re short on inventory**—You billed your customer for five items, but\nwhen it’s time to ship them you realize you only have three items left in stock.\nUse a credit note to refund your customer for the two items they didn’t receive.\n- **Discounts**—You and your customer negotiate a discount on an invoice.\nInstead of voiding the invoice and issuing a new one, you can use a credit note\nto adjust the amount owed on the existing invoice.\n\nA credit note reduces the amount due without recording any payment. However, if\na credit note reduces the balance of an `open` invoice to 0, the invoice status\nchanges to `paid`. For information on invoice statuses, see the [Invoicing\noverview](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/overview#invoice-statuses).\n\n#### Note\n\nFor information about working with credit notes using the API, see [Generate\ncredit notes\nprogrammatically](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/programmatic-credit-notes).\n\n## Get started\n\nWhen you issue a credit note for an `open` invoice, it decreases the amount due\non the invoice. When you issue a credit note for a `paid` invoice, you credit\nthe customer’s account balance or give them a refund outside of Stripe.\n\nThe sum of all credit notes issued for an invoice can’t exceed the ​​total\namount of the invoice. For a `paid` invoice, the sum of the refund, credit, and\nout-of-band payment amounts must equal the credit note total.\n\nWhen you create a credit note, you can apply credit amounts in three ways:\n\n- Discount a fixed amount from an invoice line item.\n- Discount a quantity from an invoice line item. The total discount is the\ndiscount quantity times the unit price of that line item.\n- Apply a discount to the total invoice amount by adding a custom discount line\nitem with a description, quantity, and unit price. The total discount is the\nquantity times the unit price.\n\nWe recommend discounting invoice line items when possible, since it associates\neach credit with a line item. Adding a custom discount line item can make\nreporting and tracking difficult, because the credit isn’t associated with a\nreal invoice line item.\n\n#### Note\n\nYou can’t combine discount types on an invoice line item. For example, if you\ndiscount a line item quantity, then a future credit note can only discount that\nline item by quantity, not by amount. If you discount a line item amount, then a\nfuture credit note can only discount that line item by amount, not by quantity.\n\n## Create a credit note\n\nYou can create credit notes for open or paid invoices.\n\n- Open the [Invoices page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/invoices) in the\nDashboard.\n- Select the open or paid invoice you want to add a credit note to.\n- Click **More** and select **Issue a credit note**.\n- Select a reason for the credit note.\n- (*Optional*) Perform the following actions:\n\n- Edit line item credit quantities or amounts.\n- Click **Add item** to add a custom line item.\n- Click **Set item tax** to select a tax rate to use for credit purposes.\n- If the invoice is `paid`, choose whether to refund the customer’s card, credit\ntheir balance, or refund the amount outside of Stripe (for example, cash).\n- Click **Issue credit note** to submit the credit note.\n\n#### Note\n\nOpen invoices can’t have a credit note with a pending\n[payment_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-payment_intent).\n\n!\n\nIssue a credit note in the Dashboard\n\n## Credit balances and discounts\n\nWhen you issue a credit note on an invoice with an applied [customer credit\nbalance](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/customer/balance), funds are\nsometimes credited to the credit balance instead of the initial payment method.\nFor example, if a credit balance of 150 USD is applied to an invoice for 200\nUSD, then the finalized invoice is for 50 USD. If you issue a credit note for 50\nUSD or less, the funds are refunded to the customer’s payment method. Anything\nabove 50 USD is added to the customer’s credit balance and is applied to the\nnext invoice.\n\n[Discounts](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/taxes/tax-rates#discounts) apply\nproportionally to all of the line items on an invoice. For example, applying a\n50% discount to an invoice with 10 line items at 10 USD each changes the amount\nof each line item to 5 USD. If you then apply a credit note for one line item,\nit reduces the invoice amount by 5 USD.\n\nFixed-amount discounts work the same way. If you apply a 10 USD discount to an\ninvoice with 10 line items at 10 USD, each line item is 10% of the sum amount\nand is discounted by 10% * 10 USD = 1 USD. The amount of each line item becomes\n9 USD. If you then apply a credit note for one line item, it reduces the invoice\namount by 9 USD.\n\nIf you want to credit the original line item amount, you can make up the\ndifference by adding a custom discount line item to the credit note. For\nexample, if a discount reduced a line item’s credit amount from 10 USD to 9 USD,\nyou can add a custom discount line item for 1 USD.\n\n## Voiding credit notes\n\nYou can void a credit note only if it’s on an open invoice. Voiding a credit\nnote reverses its adjustment, increasing the amount due on the invoice by the\namount of the credit note.\n\nTo void a credit note in the Dashboard, click the overflow menu () at the top\nright of the credit note, then select **Void credit note**.\n\n## Crediting negative line items\n\nYou can also credit negative invoice line items.\n\nThe following restrictions apply:\n\n- The total amount of the credit note must remain positive.\n- The total amount credited to a negative line item must be negative.\n- The total amount credited to a negative line item can’t be less than the line\nitem amount.\n\nYou also can’t credit a negative amount on a custom credit note line item. We\nonly support negative amounts on credit note line items that are tied to invoice\nline items.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Stripe data](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data)\n\n## Links\n\n- [invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n- [revising it](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/invoice-edits)\n- [Invoicing\noverview](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/overview#invoice-statuses)\n- [Generate credit notes\nprogrammatically](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/programmatic-credit-notes)\n- [Invoices page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/invoices)\n-\n[payment_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-payment_intent)\n- [customer credit balance](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/customer/balance)\n- [Discounts](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/taxes/tax-rates#discounts)\n- [Stripe data](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data)",
