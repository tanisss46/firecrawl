In Stripe, these are referred to as “digital products.” To\ncollect this tax on Stripe, you must be a remote seller without a physical\npresence in the country.\n\n## When to register for tax collection\n\nSee [Thresholds](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/thresholds) to get insights\nabout your potential tax registration obligations in Moldova.

Learn more about how the [monitoring tool\nworks](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/monitoring).\n\nRemote sellers selling services provided through electronic networks (digital\nproducts) to individuals in Moldova have to register for tax from their first\nsale there. Sales to business customers in Moldova don’t trigger any tax\nregistration obligations because non-resident businesses aren’t required to\ncollect tax on these sales.\n\n- **Threshold**: 1 transaction\n- **Included transactions**: Business-to-consumer (B2C) sales of digital goods\nor electronically supplied services (digital products)\n\n## Register to collect tax\n\nYou must be a remote seller with no physical presence in Moldova to collect this\ntax on Stripe.\n\nFind more information on how to register for VAT in Moldova on the [government\nwebsite](https://sfs.md/ro/servicii/nerezidenti) (Romanian content)\n\nAfter you’ve registered to collect tax in Moldova, go to\n[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations?location=md) to\nadd your registrations to Stripe in the Dashboard.

Stripe doesn’t calculate tax for products that don’t use a digital\nproduct tax code.\n\nView the list of supported [digital product tax\ncodes](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes?type=digital). To calculate taxes\nin Moldova, make sure that you [assign a tax\ncode](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/products-prices-tax-codes-tax-behavior#tax-code-on-product)\nto each of your products.\n\n## Report and file your taxes\n\nStripe Tax has filing partners—Taxually, Marosa, and Hands-off Sales Tax\n(HOST)—to help automate your tax filing.
