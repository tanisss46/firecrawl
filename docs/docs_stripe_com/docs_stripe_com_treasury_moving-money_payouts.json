  "content": "# Payouts and top-ups from Stripe Payments\n\n## Learn how to move money between Payments account balances and Treasury financial account balances.\n\nYou can move money from Stripe Payments to Stripe Treasury with\n[payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/payouts#payouts), and\nfrom Stripe Treasury back to Stripe Payments with\n[top-ups](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/payouts#top-ups).\n\n## Financial accounts as external accounts\n\nBefore you can send payouts to a Treasury financial account or receive top-ups\nfrom a Treasury financial account, you must set the financial account as an\nexternal account (BankAccount object) connected to the relevant Stripe account.\n\n- Connected accounts: Use [POST\n/v1/accounts/{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}/external_accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api/external_account_bank_accounts/create)\nwith the financial account `routing_number` and `account_number` to create a\n`BankAccount` object you can use for payouts from a connected account\n- Platform accounts: Use the Stripe Dashboard to create a `BankAccount` object\nyou can use for payouts from, or top-ups to, your platform account\n\nIf there isn’t a default external account set for the `usd` currency, the\nfinancial account becomes the account’s default payout destination. If there is\none, you can make the financial account the default for a connected account by\nsetting\n[default_for_currency](https://docs.stripe.com/api/external_account_bank_accounts/create?lang=node#account_create_bank_account-default_for_currency)\nto true, as in the following example. If you have an automatic payout schedule\nenabled, that changes the target of the payouts to the financial account.\n\n```\ncurl\nhttps://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts/{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}/external_accounts \\\n -u sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2: \\\n -d \"external_account[object]\"=\"bank_account\" \\\n -d \"external_account[routing_number]\"=\"{{FINANCIAL_ACCOUNT_ROUTING_NUMBER}}\" \\\n -d \"external_account[account_number]\"=\"{{FINANCIAL_ACCOUNT_ACCOUNT_NUMBER}}\" \\\n -d \"external_account[country]\"=\"US\" \\\n -d \"external_account[currency]\"=\"usd\" \\\n -d \"default_for_currency\"=\"true\"\n```\n\nIf successful, the response returns the newly created `BankAccount` object.\n\n```\n{\n \"id\": \"{{BANK_ACCOUNT_ID}}\",\n \"object\": \"bank_account\",\n \"account\": \"{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}\",\n \"account_holder_name\": null,\n \"account_holder_type\": null,\n \"available_payout_methods\": [\n \"standard\",\n \"instant\"\n ],\n ...\n \"default_for_currency\": true,\n ...\n}\n```\n\n### Fifth Third financial accounts as external accounts\n\n#### Private preview\n\nAccess to Fifth Third is currently limited to preview users. [Reach out to\nus](mailto:treasury-support@stripe.com) if you’re interested in trying it out.\n\nYou now have the option to set up an external account by specifying the\nfinancial account `id`. You must also request the\n[intra_stripe_flows](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/financial_accounts/object#financial_account_object-features-intra_stripe_flows)\nfeature on your Financial Account.\n\n```\ncurl\nhttps://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts/{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}/external_accounts \\\n -u sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2: \\\n -d \"external_account[object]\"=\"bank_account\" \\\n -d \"external_account[financial_account]\"=\"{{FINANCIAL_ACCOUNT_ID}}\" \\\n -d \"external_account[country]\"=\"US\" \\\n -d \"external_account[currency]\"=\"usd\" \\\n -d \"default_for_currency\"=\"true\"\n```\n\n## Payouts\n\nEvery Stripe platform account and connected account has an account balance (also\ncalled a payments balance or acquiring balance) that stores their money. Those\nfunds aren’t directly accessible for use outside Stripe. Payouts move funds from\nan account balance to an externally accessible Treasury financial account\nbalance or external bank account.\n\nYou can fund a Treasury financial account using automatic or manual payouts. For\nmore information about Treasury accounts, see the [Stripe Treasury accounts\nstructure\nguide](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/account-management/treasury-accounts-structure).\n\nTo learn more about how payouts work with Connect, see the [Pay out money\nguide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/add-and-pay-out-guide).\n\n## Automatic payouts\n\nIf you have connected accounts on your platform with an automatic payout\nschedule, you can change the target of direct payouts from their external bank\naccounts to their financial accounts. It requires the Treasury financial account\nto be set up as a `BankAccount` object; see the [Financial accounts as external\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/payouts#financial-accounts-as-external-accounts)\nsection for more information.\n\n## Automatic payout speeds\n\nBy default, when using automatic payouts, funds from incoming card payments\nbecome available in the financial account balance two business days after the\npayment is received (T+2 schedule). Other payment types, such as ACH payments\ntake longer.\n\nAfter a platform-level credit approval, you can enable T+1 faster payouts on a\nper-account basis for connected accounts. You can set the `interval` and\n`delay_days` parameters with `POST /v1/accounts` to accelerate payout schedules\nautomatically (or you can manually trigger faster payouts as described below).\nContact [treasury-support@stripe.com](mailto:treasury-support@stripe.com) if you\nwant to request access to faster payouts (manual, automated, or both) for the\nconnected accounts on your platform.\n\nT+1 faster payout schedules apply to all payment types, including card payments\nand ACH payments.\n\n### T+1 automatic payout schedule\n\nTo have incoming payments automatically available in the financial account on\nthe next business day, send a request with `interval` set to `daily` and\n`delay_days` set to `1`.\n\nUse [POST\n/v1/accounts/{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-settings-payouts-schedule)\nto update the payout schedule.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts/{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}} \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d \"settings[payouts][schedule][interval]\"=daily \\\n -d \"settings[payouts][schedule][delay_days]\"=1\n```\n\nThe response confirms the updated settings.\n\n```\n{\n ...\n \"settings\": {\n \"payouts\": {\n \"schedule\": {\n \"interval\": \"daily\",\n \"delay_days\": 1,\n },\n },\n ...\n }\n ...\n}\n```\n\n## Manual payouts\n\nYou can use manual payouts to send specific portions of an account balance to\nthat account’s Treasury financial account.\n\nUse [POST /v1/payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payouts/create) with the bank\naccount `id` associated with your financial account specified as the\n`destination` parameter value. If you don’t have a `BankAccount` object\nassociated with your Treasury financial account yet, see the [Financial accounts\nas external\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/payouts#financial-accounts-as-external-accounts)\nsection for more information.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payouts \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d method=standard \\\n -d amount=1000 \\\n -d currency=usd \\\n -d destination={{BANK_ACCOUNT_ID}}\n```\n\nIf successful, the response returns the newly created [Payout\nobject](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payouts/object).\n\n```\n{\n \"id\": \"{{PAYOUT_ID}}\",\n \"object\": \"payout\",\n \"amount\": 1000,\n ...\n \"currency\": \"usd\",\n \"destination\": \"{{BANK_ACCOUNT_ID}}\",\n ...\n \"method\": \"standard\",\n ...\n}\n```\n\n## Manual payout speeds\n\nTwo speed methods are available for manual payouts - `standard` and `instant`.\n\nManual payouts using `standard` speed can only draw on the `available` balance,\nand funds will generally arrive in the financial account in one business day\n(T+1 schedule).\n\nIf your platform is enabled for faster payouts, you can use `instant` manual\npayouts to move funds to a connected account’s financial account within an hour.\nYou can request instant manual payouts at any time, including weekends and\nholidays, and instant manual payouts can draw on the `instant_available` balance\nof a Stripe account. If your platform is not enabled for faster payouts and\nyou’re interested in adding the ability, contact\n[treasury-support@stripe.com](mailto:treasury-support@stripe.com) to request the\nfeature.\n\nTo request an instant manual payout rather than a standard manual payout, change\nthe `method` parameter in the payout request from `standard` to `instant`.\n\n## Testing payouts\n\nYou can simulate a payout to a connected account financial account using test\nmode API keys.\n\nYou can only simulate a payout to a platform financial account using the\nDashboard. While in test mode, click the **Add money** button in the upper right\nof the [Balances](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/treasury) view of your\nDashboard to open the **Add Money** dialog. Follow the prompts to simulate\nsending money from your platform account balance to your financial account\nbalance.\n\n![Stripe Dashboard open to the Treasury balance page in test mode with the Add\nmoney button\nhighlighted.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/test-payout.31e4405710a6d92e3592f570ac86f0be.png)\n\nAdd money button\n\n## Top-ups\n\nAs the owner of a [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect) platform, you can\nuse an eligible Treasury financial account balance to top-up your platform\naccount balance instead of using an external bank account. Your financial\naccount must have the\n[financial_addresses.aba](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/account-management/financial-account-features#available-features)\nfeature active to be eligible. To top-up a platform account balance, you must\nset the platform’s Treasury financial account as the platform’s default external\n`BankAccount` using the Stripe Dashboard as described in the [Adding funds to\nyour platform balance](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/top-ups) guide.\n\nUnlike true external bank accounts, new `BankAccount` objects with Treasury\nfinancial account details owned by the merchant with the BankAccount object are\nautomatically verified upon creation so they don’t require verification with\nmicrodeposits.\n\nAfter you set the Treasury financial account as your platform’s default external\nbank account, use `POST /v1/topups` to create the top-up.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/topups \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d amount=2000 \\\n -d currency=usd \\\n -d description=Top-up \\\n -d statement_descriptor=Top-up\n```\n\nIf successful, the response returns the `Top-Up` object.\n\n```\n{\n \"id\": \"{{TOP_UP_ID}}\",\n \"object\": \"topup\",\n \"amount\": 2000,\n \"currency\": \"usd\",\n \"description\": \"Top-up\",\n ...\n}\n```\n\nLearn more about [adding funds to your platform account\nbalance](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/top-ups) with Stripe Connect.\n\n## Links\n\n- [payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/payouts#payouts)\n- [top-ups](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/payouts#top-ups)\n- [POST\n/v1/accounts/{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}/external_accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api/external_account_bank_accounts/create)\n-\n[default_for_currency](https://docs.stripe.com/api/external_account_bank_accounts/create?lang=node#account_create_bank_account-default_for_currency)\n-\n[intra_stripe_flows](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/financial_accounts/object#financial_account_object-features-intra_stripe_flows)\n- [Stripe Treasury accounts structure\nguide](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/account-management/treasury-accounts-structure)\n- [Pay out money guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/add-and-pay-out-guide)\n- [POST\n/v1/accounts/{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-settings-payouts-schedule)\n- [POST /v1/payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payouts/create)\n- [Payout object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payouts/object)\n- [Balances](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/treasury)\n- [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)\n-\n[financial_addresses.aba](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/account-management/financial-account-features#available-features)\n- [Adding funds to your platform\nbalance](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/top-ups)",
