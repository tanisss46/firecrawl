# Adds requirement for requested_capabilities on custom account creationBreaking changes

## What’s new

In the Accounts API, the `requested_capabilities` property is now required at
creation time for custom accounts in all countries. To learn more, see [Account
capabilities](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities).

## Impact

Forces you to explicitly specify the capabilities you require for a custom
account during the account creation process. This ensures that the necessary
capabilities are properly requested and configured from the start.
