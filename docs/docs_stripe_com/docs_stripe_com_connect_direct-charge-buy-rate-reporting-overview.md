# Platform Reporting for direct charge payment fees paid by connected accounts

Platforms that pay payments fees for direct charges they facilitate on their
connected accounts can use the reports outlined here to understand those fees.

## Financial reports

[Stripe’s financial reports](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-reports) help you
understand and reconcile the activity in your account, in particular the total
costs and earnings of your platform. These reports are available for download in
the Dashboard or through the API.

## Connect margin reports

The [Connect margin reports](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/margin-reports)
show platforms their aggregated and transaction-level payment volumes, fees, and
revenue associated with activity where the platform is responsible for pricing
and fees. Use them to calculate your margins and set your fees appropriately
given your underlying Stripe fees and network costs. These reports are available
for download in the Dashboard.

## Sigma and Data Pipeline

All Sigma and Data Pipeline users have access to [the itemized_fees
table](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data/access-data-in-dashboard). It offers
a comprehensive, granular breakdown of every fee charged to or deducted from
your Stripe balance. You can use it to review itemized details of card, LPM, and
product fees that your platform has paid.
