# Marketing Treasury-based services

## Create precise messaging for your users that complies with regulations.

Many states have statutory prohibitions on references to “banking," “banks," and
“bank accounts” when the entities making these references are not state- or
federally-chartered banks or credit unions. Imprecise terminology of Stripe
Treasury accounts might draw scrutiny from regulators.

## Cash back compliance marketing guidance

As a platform, you can provide your customers with cash back, calculated in
relation to their Treasury balance. We understand that this can be a great value
proposition as part of your product. When you market and disclose cash back to
your potential and existing customers, don’t conflate cash back with yield or
interest. We’ve outlined best practices for your marketing disclosures below. If
you have any questions on how to present cash back in your marketing, reach out
to our compliance team at
[platform-compliance@stripe.com](mailto:platform-compliance@stripe.com)

- Recommended Terms:- Always refer to cash back as “cash back,” “rewards,” or
other terms that don’t imply interest.
- Always disclose prominently in your marketing materials that the cash back
program is subject to change and the conditions under which it might change.
- Notify your existing customers whenever the cash back program has changed.
Prominently display the calculation method in their Dashboard.
- Terms to avoid- Never refer to cash back as “interest” or “yield.”
- Don’t reference the Fed Funds Rate as a benchmark for calculating cash back.
- Don’t imply that cash back is is pass-through interest from a bank partner.

### How to talk about FDIC insurance eligibility

Stripe Treasury balances are stored value accounts that are held “for the
benefit of” our Stripe Treasury users with our bank partners, Evolve Bank &
Trust and Goldman Sachs Bank USA. We disclose to you which of our partners hold
your funds. For FDIC insurance to apply to a user’s balance in a “for the
benefit of” account, we must satisfy the rules for FDIC pass-through deposit
insurance, unlike a bank account directly with an FDIC insured bank.

We understand that FDIC insurance eligibility can be a valuable feature to your
customers. Stripe has approved the variations of the phrase “FDIC Insurance
**eligible**” noted below on marketing materials, as long as certain conditions
are met. **Specifically**, the statement of FDIC insurance eligibility must
always be paired with two disclosures:

- Stripe Treasury Accounts are eligible for FDIC pass-through deposit insurance
if they meet certain requirements. The accounts are eligible only to the extent
pass-through insurance is permitted by the rules and regulations of the FDIC,
and if the requirements for pass-through insurance are satisfied. The FDIC
insurance applies up to 250,000 USD per depositor, per financial institution,
for deposits held in the same ownership capacity.
- You must also disclose that neither Stripe nor you are an FDIC insured
institution and that the FDIC’s deposit insurance coverage only protects against
the failure of an FDIC insured depository institution.
The following terms that incorporate the term “eligible” are approved:Don’t use
the following terms:- “Eligible for FDIC insurance”
- “FDIC insurance-eligible accounts”
- “Eligible for FDIC pass-through insurance”
- “Eligible for FDIC insurance up to the standard maximum deposit insurance per
depositor in the same capacity"
- “Eligible for FDIC insurance up to $250K”
- “FDIC insured”
- “FDIC insured accounts”
- “FDIC pass-through insurance guaranteed”

We have also prepared these FAQs that you can use when your customers have
questions about FDIC insurance eligibility or any of the disclosures:

Is FDIC insurance impacted if a customer holds deposits in other accounts with
the same institution?It can be. It’s your responsibility to know which insured
institutions hold your funds. If you have other business-purpose accounts with
the same institution where Treasury funds are held, the FDIC might aggregate all
of your business account balances with that institution in applying the 250,000
USD limit. The FDIC generally does not, however, aggregate your personal
accounts with your business accounts.Does FDIC insurance eligibility protect
from fraud or financial loss?No, FDIC insurance eligibility is applicable only
in the event of a bank failure.How do I know if the requirements for FDIC
pass-through insurance are met?Stripe Treasury accounts are designed to be
eligible for FDIC pass-through insurance. The FDIC makes the final determination
about the availability of pass-through insurance at the time of a bank’s
failure.
