  "content": "# How Treasury works\n\n## Learn about connected accounts, financial accounts, and moving money with Treasury.\n\n[Stripe Treasury](https://stripe.com/treasury) is a Banking as a Service (BaaS)\nAPI for Stripe [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect) platforms that allows\nyou to embed financial services in your product.\n\nStripe provides the infrastructure in partnership with trusted banks. You can\nuse Treasury to enable your connected accounts to hold funds, pay bills, earn\ncash back, and manage their cash flow.\n\n## Building blocks for financial services\n\nStripe Treasury provides modular components for building a full-featured,\nscalable financial product.\n\nCreate accountsStore fundsMove moneyAttach payment cards\nSet up your connected accounts as Treasury customers, verify their identity, and\nprovision Treasury financial accounts with one of our bank partners.\n\n- ID verification\n- [KYC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer) checks\n- Sanctions screening\n\n## Treasury use cases\n\nThe following are examples of some common Stripe Treasury use cases:\n\nUse caseDescriptionSpend managementBuild a spend management product for your\ncustomers to store funds on your platform and manage spending with branded\ncards.Store and spend accountCreate FDIC insurance-eligible accounts that allow\nbusinesses to store funds, earn cash back, accept checks, and pay contractors\nand vendors with ACH and wire transfers.Programmatic money movementFacilitate\nmoney movement between your platform’s connected accounts and from connected\naccounts to third-party accounts.\n## Treasury account architecture\n\nUsing [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect), you onboard customers to your\nplatform as connected accounts. You can create a Treasury account for each\nconnected account to access your financial products. The following diagram\nillustrates an overview of a platform with Stripe Treasury integration.\n\n![Diagram of a platform integrated with Treasury, showing customers, platform,\nconnected and financial accounts, external bank accounts, payment cards, and\nmoney\nmovement.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/architecture.59cac501261250e0ebe9785c6f9701ce.png)\n\nTreasury account architecture\n\n![Diagram of a platform integrated with Treasury, showing customers, platform,\nconnected and financial accounts, external bank accounts, payment cards, and\nmoney\nmovement.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/architecture.59cac501261250e0ebe9785c6f9701ce.png)\n\n### Connected accounts\n\nConnected accounts are sellers or service providers that use a platform. For\nexample, if you’re a digital storefront platform owner, you provide an\ne-commerce framework that businesses use to establish online stores and collect\npayments. Each business that uses your storefront platform is a connected\naccount.\n\nTreasury only supports connected accounts that don’t use a Stripe-hosted\ndashboard and where your platform is responsible for requirements collection and\nloss liability, including Custom connected accounts. Learn how to [create\nconnected\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/design-an-integration?connect-onboarding-surface=api&connect-dashboard-type=none&connect-economic-model=buy-rate&connect-loss-liability-owner=platform&connect-charge-type=direct)\nthat work with Treasury.\n\n#### Private preview\n\nEnabling Treasury on non-custom connected accounts is a new feature. Email\n[treasury-support@stripe.com](mailto:treasury-support@stripe.com) to request\naccess.\n\nAs a platform with connected accounts, you’re responsible for maintaining a\nminimum API version, communicating terms of service updates to your connected\naccounts, handling information requests from them, and providing them with\nsupport. Because your platform is ultimately responsible for the losses your\nconnected accounts incur, you’re also responsible for vetting them for fraud. To\nlearn more, read the [Treasury fraud\nguide](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/examples/fraud-guide).\n\n### Financial accounts\n\nYou can use the Treasury endpoints of the [Stripe\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api) to create financial accounts, and attach them\nto connected accounts in a one-to-one relationship (unless you’re enrolled in\nthe [Multi FA\nbeta](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/account-management/financial-accounts#create-a-financialaccount)).\n\nYou can fund the financial accounts of your platform’s connected accounts and\nmove money between them. Your connected accounts can also fund their Treasury\nfinancial accounts using a bank external to Stripe. If your platform uses Stripe\nIssuing, you can provide payment cards linked to the financial account balance\nof your connected accounts.\n\nTreasury financial accounts have routing numbers because they’re backed by US\nbanking partners, and balances are eligible for FDIC pass-through insurance.\n\n## Sample integration\n\nFollow our two-part sample integration to see how Treasury works:\n\n- [Use Treasury to set up financial accounts and create cards with\nIssuing](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/examples/financial-accounts)\n- [Use Treasury with SetupIntents and PaymentMethods to move\nmoney](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/examples/moving-money)\n\nStripe Treasury is provided in the US by Stripe Payments Company, licensed money\ntransmitter, with funds held at Stripe’s bank partners, Members FDIC.
