# Issuing and Treasury sample app

## Learn how to onboard customers, issue cards, and make outbound payments.

To see how you can use Issuing and Treasury APIs in your integration, try our
sample app. It lets you onboard as a customer, create cards, test
authorizations, and make outbound payments from a financial account.

Without writing any code, you can also copy the sample app to use with your
platform, following the API logs generated by your actions.
