No new business onboarding or\ntransactions will be possible after June 30, 2024. Read our [support\npage](https://support.stripe.com/questions/june-2024-update-to-giropays-availability)\nfor more details.\n\ngiropay is a German payment method based on online banking, introduced in 2006.\nIt allows customers to complete transactions online using their online banking\nenvironment, with funds debited from their bank account. Depending on their\nbank, customers confirm payments on giropay using a second factor of\nauthentication or a PIN. giropay accounts for 10% of online checkouts in\nGermany.\n\ngiropay redirects customers to their website to [authenticate a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#customer-actions) and\nthere is [immediate\nnotification](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#payment-notification)\nabout the success or failure of a payment.\n\nPayment method propertiesCountry availability- **Customer locations**\n\nGermany\n- **Presentment currency**\n\nEUR\n- **Payment confirmation**\n\nCustomer-authenticated\n- **Payment method family**\n\nAuthenticated bank debit\n- **Recurring payments**\n\nNo\n- **Payout timing**\n\nStandard payout timing applies\n- **Connect support**\n\nYes\n- **Dispute support**\n\nNo\n- **Refunds / Partial refunds**\n\nYes / yes\n\n## Payment flow\n\nThis demo shows the customer experience when using Giropay.\n\n## Get started\n\nYou don’t have to integrate giropay and other payment methods individually. If\nyou use our front-end products, Stripe automatically determines the most\nrelevant payment methods to display. Go to the [Stripe\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and enable\ngiropay. To get started with one of our hosted UIs, follow a quickstart:\n\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart): Our prebuilt, hosted\ncheckout page.\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart): Our drop-in UI\ncomponents.\n\n### Other payment products\n\nThe following Stripe products also let you add giropay from the Dashboard:\n\n- [Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/no-code-guide)\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n\nIf your integration requires manually listing payment methods, learn how to\n[manually configure giropay as a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/giropay/accept-a-payment).\n\n## Disputed payments\n\nThe risk of fraud or unrecognized payments is low because the customer must\nauthenticate the payment with their bank. As a result, you won’t have disputes\nthat turn into chargebacks, with funds withdrawn from your Stripe account.\n\n## Refunds\n\ngiropay payments can be refunded up to 180 days after the original payment date.\n\n## Links\n\n- [support\npage](https://support.stripe.com/questions/june-2024-update-to-giropays-availability)\n- [authenticate a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#customer-actions)\n- [immediate\nnotification](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#payment-notification)\n- [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods)\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart)\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart)\n- [Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/no-code-guide)\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n- [manually configure giropay as a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/giropay/accept-a-payment)",
