You must set up 3DS to see your authentication analytics. To set up\n3DS, see [Authenticate with 3D\nSecure](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure/authentication-flow).\n\n#### Public preview\n\n[Payments analytics](https://dashboard.stripe.com/acceptance) is in public\npreview. If you’re not part of the public preview, you can still access these\nanalytics by navigating to **Reporting** > **Reports** > **Authentication\nanalytics** in the Dashboard. If you want access to the public preview, you can\n[join the waitlist](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/analytics).\n\n## Configure your data set\n\nUse filters to control all the metrics, charts, and tables on this page.\n\nThese metrics and charts exclude:\n\n- 3DS requests that occur during [card\nvalidations](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/card-testing)\n- Payments made with digital wallets such as Apple Pay and Google pay. These\ndigital wallets use device-based authentication methods (such as biometrics)\ninstead of 3DS\n- 3DS requests for [Data\nOnly](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure/strong-customer-authentication-exemptions#data-only)\nauthentication. Data Only doesn’t lead to 3DS challenges or [liability\nshift](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure/authentication-flow#disputed-payments)\nfor your customers.\n\n### Specify currency\n\nThe `Currency` filter is set to your settlement currency by default. To change\nthe currency, click **Currency** , and select the currency you want from the\nlist.\n\n### Specify data as Raw or Deduplicated\n\nYou can also view your data as `Raw` or `Deduplicated`:\n\n- **Raw** (default): Raw data includes all payment attempts, including repeat\nattempts to complete a payment. When Stripe calculates the raw rate, we include\nall attempts except invalid API requests.\n- **Deduplicated**: Deduplicated data only includes the final outcome of payment\nattempts that belong to the same payment. For example, Stripe considers a single\ncustomer repeatedly trying and failing a payment as a single attempt.\n\n### Specify Connect\n\nYou can view the direct charge activity for all of your connected accounts by\ndefault. Use the **Connected accounts** filter if you want to exclude data from\nyour connected accounts. Data from [Standard connected\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/accounts#standard-accounts) is only\nvisible if you enable [Platform\ncontrols](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/platform-controls-for-stripe-dashboard-accounts).\n\n## Download authentication data\n\nTo download these analytics, click **Download** at the top of each chart. The\nCSV file you download matches any filters you selected and by default displays\nyour analytics in your settlement currency. To change the currency, click\n**Currency** (), and select the currency you want from the list.\n\n## Key metrics\n\nThese metrics include all payments where 3D Secure was requested, covering both\nsuccessful and unsuccessful authentication attempts.\n\nMetricDefinitionAuthentication ratePercentage of payments where 3DS was\nattempted, out of all payments.Authentication success ratePercentage of payments\nwhere 3DS was successfully completed out of all 3DS attempts.Challenge\nratePercentage of payments where the customer receives a challenge out of all\n3DS attempts.Challenge success ratePercentage of payments where a 3DS challenge\nwas successfully completed out of all the payments that require and receive a\nchallenge from 3DS.\n### Calculate authentication rates\n\nThe following example explains how Stripe calculates authentication success\nrates:\n\nMetricValueTotal payments requests to Stripe100,000Total payments without\n3DS60,000Total payments with 3DS requests40,000Total 3Ds requests with challenge\nflow20,000Total 3DS requests successful with challenge flow16,000Authentication\nrate40% = (40,000 / 100,000)Authentication success rate87.5% = (35,000 /\n40,000)Challenge rate50% = (20,000 / 40,000)Challenge success rate80% = (16,000\n/ 20,000)\n## 3D Secure authentication outcomes\n\nUse this chart to see all the outcomes for payments authentication through 3D\nSecure. You can toggle this chart by 3DS requests, share of 3DS requests, and\n3DS request volume.\n\nSuccessful 3DS frictionless flowThis outcome represents payments that\nsuccessfully completed 3DS without any additional cardholder input needed,\nincluding payments that were successfully exempted through 3DS.Successful 3DS\nchallenge flowThis outcome includes payments that successfully authenticated\nusing 3DS where the customer provided additional input to verify their identity\nto the card issuer.Failed 3DS challengeThis outcome represents payments where\nthe customer abandoned the authentication flow or the payment was rejected by\nthe customer’s bank.3DS unavailableThis outcome represents situations where the\nbank doesn’t support 3DS or the issuing bank returns an error.3DS not\nactionedThis outcome refers to instances where the customer didn’t enter the 3DS\nflow, or there was an issue with your integration and it didn’t action the\nattempt. To troubleshoot, review your [3DS\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure/authentication-flow)\n## 3D Secure authentication request reasons\n\nUse this chart to see what initiated 3D Secure for your payments to evaluate if\nyou want to make adjustments to the frequency of when 3DS is requested.\n\nAPI requestPayments where you requested 3DS through your Stripe integration. 3DS\ncan be triggered manually using the API. Stripe’s SCA rules run automatically,\nregardless of whether or not you manually request 3DS. You can include\nadditional 3DS prompts but they aren’t required for SCA.Radar requestPayments\nthat match a Radar rule to request 3DS. The default method to trigger 3DS is\nusing Radar to dynamically request 3DS based on risk level and other\nrequirements.Stripe requestStripe requests 3DS because of regulations or\noptimizations using our [Authentication\nengine](https://stripe.com/payments/authentication). Stripe automatically\nattempts to maximize payments success while minimizing fraud.Bank\nrequestPayments where the customer’s bank requests 3DS with the [soft decline\ncode](https://docs.stripe.com/declines/codes) `authentication_required`.\n## Strong Customer Authentication\n\nUse this chart to see which of your payments were considered in scope of [Strong\nCustomer Authentication\n(SCA)](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication) rules. SCA\nrequires businesses in Europe and the UK to use 3DS to help prevent fraud for\n[customer-initiated](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/cits-and-mits#customer-initiated-transactions-(cit))\nonline payments.\n\nStripe might request exemptions on your behalf for qualifying in scope payments\nto minimize friction for your users and to increase your payments success rate.\nStripe won’t attempt to request exemptions in cases where you explicitly request\n3DS using the API. Exempted payments don’t benefit from [liability\nshift](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure/authentication-flow#disputed-payments).\n\n- This chart is only visible if your business is based in Europe.\n- This chart includes payments [within SCA\nscope](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure/strong-customer-authentication-exemptions).\n- This chart includes payments considered as [SCA\nexemptions](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure/strong-customer-authentication-exemptions).\nSCA exemptions are considered in scope of SCA rules.\n- This chart excludes payments outside of SCA scope, such\n[merchant-initiated](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/cits-and-mits#merchant-initiated-transactions-(mit))\npayments.\n- This chart excludes payments from digital wallets like Apple Pay and Google\nPay because they don’t use 3DS.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Glossary](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/analytics/glossary)\n- [Acceptance analytics](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/analytics/acceptance)\n- [Payment methods\nanalytics](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/analytics/payment-methods)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Authentication](https://dashboard.stripe.com/authentication)\n- [3D Secure (3DS)](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure)\n-\n[liability](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure/authentication-flow#disputed-payments)\n- [Authenticate with 3D\nSecure](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure/authentication-flow)\n- [Payments analytics](https://dashboard.stripe.com/acceptance)\n- [join the waitlist](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/analytics)\n- [card validations](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/card-testing)\n- [Data\nOnly](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure/strong-customer-authentication-exemptions#data-only)\n- [Standard connected\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/accounts#standard-accounts)\n- [Platform\ncontrols](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/platform-controls-for-stripe-dashboard-accounts)\n- [Authentication engine](https://stripe.com/payments/authentication)\n- [soft decline code](https://docs.stripe.com/declines/codes)\n- [Strong Customer Authentication\n(SCA)](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication)\n-\n[customer-initiated](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/cits-and-mits#customer-initiated-transactions-(cit))\n- [within SCA\nscope](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure/strong-customer-authentication-exemptions)\n-\n[merchant-initiated](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/cits-and-mits#merchant-initiated-transactions-(mit))\n- [Glossary](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/analytics/glossary)\n- [Acceptance analytics](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/analytics/acceptance)\n- [Payment methods\nanalytics](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/analytics/payment-methods)",
