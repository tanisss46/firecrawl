Products\ndefine what your business offers, whether that’s goods or services. Prices\ndefine how much and how often to charge for products.\n\nYou can create products and prices in Stripe or\n[import](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/getting-started#import-products-prices)\nthem into Stripe through the [API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/products). After\nyou create products and prices, you can use them with [Checkout\nSessions](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create), [Payment\nLinks](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links),\n[Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing),\n[Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/quotes/create), or a custom integration to\ncreate [Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing).\n\n## Products\n\nProducts describe the specific goods or services you offer to your customers.\n\n- If you’re an e-commerce store selling clothing, one of your products might be\na large white t-shirt. In Stripe, you can create a separate product for each\nsize and color combination.\n- If you’re a SaaS platform, you might have basic and premium pricing tiers. In\nthis case, both basic and premium are separate products because they typically\noffer unique attributes or features.\n- If you’re a donation platform that accepts donations for several different\ncauses, each cause is a different product.\n\nEach product has a unique ID. Unlike most Stripe resources, you can choose the\nID of the product yourself. We recommend choosing an ID that makes it easy to\nintegrate Stripe with other systems you use. For example, if you’re selling\nphysical goods, you can use the internal ID from your own systems.\n\nWhen you create a product in Stripe, you have to provide a name. You can\noptionally add other attributes, like a description or image. If you’re using\n[Stripe Tax](https://docs.stripe.com/tax), you can also define a [tax\ncode](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes) for each product, such as pet\ngrooming, e-books, or SaaS. Stripe Tax uses the tax code to automatically\ncalculate and collect sales taxes during purchase.\n\n## Prices\n\nIn Stripe, price objects are more than a numerical amount to pay. Prices include\nadditional information, such as tax behavior, volume tiers, and recurrence\nintervals for subscriptions. You don’t need to create new prices for each\npurchase–if you’re selling a product for one price, you only need to create one\nprice. You can also make this price the [default\nprice](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/manage-prices#default-price) for\nthe product.\n\nPrices can either be one-time or recurring. Subscriptions use recurring prices\nto charge the customer at an interval, such as “once a month.” If you sell the\nsame service at several different subscription intervals, it’s best to create\nmultiple recurring prices for the same product. Learn more about [pricing\nmodels](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models#flat-rate).\n\nA single Price can support multiple currencies. For example, if you sell a\nproduct in the USA for 10 USD, Europe for 9 EUR, and Japan for 1300 JPY, the\nsame Price object can cover all three currencies. Each purchase uses one of the\nPrice’s supported currencies, depending on how you use the Price in your\nintegration. Learn more about [multi-currency\nPrices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models#multicurrency).\n\nBecause a product can have multiple prices associated with it, you’ll need to\nspecify which price to use when creating Checkout Sessions, Payment Links,\nInvoices, Quotes, or Subscriptions.\n\nMost prices define a fixed `unit_amount`, but you can also configure the price\nto function with different tiers or usage-based models. Learn more about [tiered\npricing](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models#tiered-pricing)\nand [usage-based\npricing](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models#usage-based-pricing).\n\nIf you’re using Stripe Tax, you can specify the `tax_behavior` for the price to\ndetermine whether the tax is already included in the amount, or if it needs to\nbe added. Learn more about [tax\nbehavior](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/products-prices-tax-codes-tax-behavior#tax-behavior).\n\n## Working with products and prices\n\n### Create or import products and prices\n\nThe quickest way to get started with products and prices is to create them\nthrough the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/products).\n\nIf you have a large product catalog that you manage using a spreadsheet or other\nsoftware, you might prefer to import the product catalog programmatically using\nthe [Products](https://docs.stripe.com/api/products) and\n[Prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices) API. Learn more about [import\nproducts and\nprices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/getting-started#import-products-prices).\n\nIf you need to charge an amount of money that’s different for each transaction\n(for example, a user-selected donation amount), you can create the product, but\nnot create a price. Instead, you can use the `price_data` parameter when\ncreating Checkout Sessions or Subscriptions to set the particular price.\n\n### Use products and prices\n\nStripe CheckoutPayment LinksSubscriptionsQuotesInvoices\nWhen creating a Checkout Session, specify the price `id` for each line item. The\nCheckout Session uses the price to compute the order total. It also retrieves\nthe product associated with the price, then uses the product’s name and image to\nrender the Checkout page.\n\n## Manage existing products and prices\n\nYou can update product details through the Dashboard or API. For example, you\nmight change the description of a product, or add new product images to use on\nthe [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout) page.\n\nIf you’re no longer selling a product, you can archive both it and the price\nthrough the Dashboard by clicking the **Archive** button, or through the API by\nsetting `active` to `false`. We store the archived product and price information\nindefinitely to maintain records of past transactions.\n\nIn general, you can’t delete products or prices, you can only archive them. In\ncertain cases, you can use the Dashboard to delete a price that has never been\nused, or to delete a product that doesn’t have any prices set.\n\nTo change the price of a product, create a new price for the new amount, then\narchive the existing price by setting `active` to false. Instead of changing the\n`unit_amount` on the existing price, you need to create a new price to make sure\nthat we keep the existing price as an immutable record of past transactions.\n\nYou can set a [default\nprice](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/manage-prices#default-price) on a\nproduct to specify the most common price to present to customers. You can change\nthe default price to another price later, such as if you increase the price of\nyour product.\n\n## Understand product and price compatibility\n\nNot all features of products and prices are compatible with all Stripe APIs.\nConsult the following table for compatibility information.\n\nFeature Checkout Payment Links Quotes Subscriptions Invoices Product\nimagesIgnored*Ignored*Ignored*Product descriptionsIgnored*Ignored*Product tax\ncodesProduct statement descriptorIgnored*Recurring pricesMulti-currency\npricesIgnored*Ignored*Tiered pricesDisallowed*Decimal amounts (for example,\ncharging half-a-cent per unit)Disallowed*Usage-based pricesDisallowed*Customer\nchooses priceDisallowed*Disallowed*Disallowed*\nEntries marked as Disallowed indicate that if a product or price uses this\nfeature, you can’t use that product or price with this Stripe API.\n\nEntries marked as Ignored indicate that the feature has no effect with this\nStripe API, but you can still use the product or price as usual.\n\n## Understand limitations\n\nWe don’t limit the number of customers, coupons, products, prices, or most other\nobjects that you can create in your Stripe account.\n\nWhen using recurring prices with Subscriptions:\n\n- All prices on a Subscription must have the same\n[recurring.interval](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/create#create_price-recurring-interval)\nand\n[recurring.interval_count](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/create#create_price-recurring-interval_count)\n- The maximum interval time period of a price is 3 years\n\n## Links\n\n-\n[import](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/getting-started#import-products-prices)\n- [API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/products)\n- [Checkout Sessions](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create)\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n- [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing)\n- [Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/quotes/create)\n- [Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing)\n- [guide](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/getting-started)\n- [Stripe Tax](https://docs.stripe.com/tax)\n- [tax code](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes)\n- [default\nprice](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/manage-prices#default-price)\n- [pricing\nmodels](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models#flat-rate)\n- [multi-currency\nPrices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models#multicurrency)\n- [tiered\npricing](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models#tiered-pricing)\n- [usage-based\npricing](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models#usage-based-pricing)\n- [tax\nbehavior](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/products-prices-tax-codes-tax-behavior#tax-behavior)\n- [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/products)\n- [Prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices)\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout)\n-\n[recurring.interval](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/create#create_price-recurring-interval)\n-\n[recurring.interval_count](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/create#create_price-recurring-interval_count)",
