  "content": "# Connected account Treasury supportability\n\n## Learn how Stripe evaluates connected accounts for Treasury supportability.\n\n#### Note\n\nThe supportability process described in this document takes effect on January\n28, 2025.\n\nIn order to support Treasury features, a connected account must be a supportable\nbusiness and must [fulfill certain\nrequirements](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/requirements). Stripe reviews\neach connected account using its provided URL and product descriptions to\ndetermine whether it meets Fifth Third Bank’s policy standards. Most connected\naccounts that provide accurate information are supportable without requiring any\naction.\n\nWhen a platform requests the Treasury capability for a connected account, Stripe\nreviews the account for supportability.\n\nMost supportability reviews complete instantaneously, but some are inconclusive\ndue to insufficient information. To reduce the chance of inconclusive reviews,\nmake sure that your connected account onboarding process collects [valid URLs\nand comprehensive product descriptions using many\nsentences](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/fifth-third#request-fifth-third-bank-access-for-new-or-existing-connected-accounts).\n\n## API Visibility\n\nIf a connected account has any outstanding Treasury requirements, they’re\nvisible in the requirements hash as [currently_due\nrequirements](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-requirements-currently_due).\n\nThe following example [retrieves\ninformation](https://docs.stripe.com/api/capabilities/retrieve) about a\nconnected account’s `treasury` capability, including any outstanding\n`currently_due` requirements.\n\n```\ncurl\nhttps://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts/{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}/capabilities/treasury\n\\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\"\n```\n\n### Supportability statuses in the API\n\n- **Supportable**: If a connected account has no outstanding requirements, and\nour review determines that its business is supportable, its\n[capabilities.treasury](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-capabilities-treasury)\nis set to `active`. The account can then access Treasury features.\n- **In Review**: If a connected account has no outstanding requirements for the\n`treasury` capability, but we’re still evaluating whether its business is\nsupportable, its\n[capabilities.treasury](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-capabilities-treasury)\nis set to `pending`. Also, the `business_profile.mcc` requirement appears in the\ncapability’s\n[requirements.pending_verification](https://docs.stripe.com/api/capabilities/object#capability_object-requirements-pending_verification)\nhash. The account can’t access Treasury features until Stripe determines that\nits business is supportable.\n- **Unsupportable**: If our review determines that a connected account’s\nbusiness is not supportable, its\n[capabilities.treasury](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-capabilities-treasury)\nis set to `inactive`. Also, the capability’s `requirements` hash has a\n[disabled_reason](https://docs.stripe.com/api/capabilities/object#capability_object-requirements-disabled_reason)\nof `rejected.unsupported_business` and includes the `business_profile.mcc`\nrequirement in its\n[currently_due](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-requirements-currently_due)\nhash. The account can’t access Treasury features.\n\n## Dashboard Visibility\n\nThe [Accounts to review\npage](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard/review-actionable-accounts) in\nyour Dashboard helps you monitor the risk and onboarding status of all of your\nconnected accounts. To identify accounts that require action related to their\nTreasury capability, click **More filters**, then click **+ Treasury capability\nstatus**. Select the statuses you want to identify, then click **Apply** to\nfilter the accounts list on that status.\n\nTo see what actions an account requires, open its details page by selecting it\nin the list. Use the **Actions required** list at the top of the Activity\nsection to [address the outstanding\nrequirements](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard/managing-individual-accounts#actions-required).\nIf an account has any outstanding requirements for Treasury, the Treasury\ncapability appears as **Inactive** in the Settings section.\n\n### Supportability statuses in the Dashboard\n\n- **Supportable**: If a connected account has no outstanding requirements, and\nour review determines that its business is supportable, the Treasury capability\nappears as **Active** in the Settings section of the account details page. No\nactions for the Treasury capability appear in the **Actions required** list. The\naccount can access Treasury features.\n- **In Review**: If a connected account has no outstanding requirements for\nTreasury, but we’re still evaluating whether their business is supportable, we\ndisplay a banner at the top of the account details page. Also, the Treasury\ncapability appears as **pending** in the Settings section of the page. Your only\naction is to monitor the account for the evaluation’s outcome.\n- **Unsupportable**: If our review determines that an account conducts a\n[prohibited or restricted\nbusinesses](https://stripe.com/legal/restricted-businesses), a task appears in\nthe **Actions required** list in the Activity section of the account details\npage. This task outlines the business classification we assigned to the\nconnected account and provides an option to appeal the decision. To appeal,\neither provide additional business details about the account or confirm that it\nno longer offers any products or services included in the prohibited and\nrestricted businesses list. If, after your appeal, Stripe determines that the\naccount still conducts a prohibited or restricted business, the Treasury\ncapability appears as `inactive` in the Settings section of the account details\npage. Hovering your cursor over the capability displays a tooltip explaining\nthat the account has been rejected due to its classification as an unsupported\nbusiness.\n\n## Links\n\n- [fulfill certain requirements](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/requirements)\n- [valid URLs and comprehensive product descriptions using many\nsentences](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/fifth-third#request-fifth-third-bank-access-for-new-or-existing-connected-accounts)\n- [currently_due\nrequirements](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-requirements-currently_due)\n- [retrieves information](https://docs.stripe.com/api/capabilities/retrieve)\n-\n[capabilities.treasury](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-capabilities-treasury)\n-\n[requirements.pending_verification](https://docs.stripe.com/api/capabilities/object#capability_object-requirements-pending_verification)\n-\n[disabled_reason](https://docs.stripe.com/api/capabilities/object#capability_object-requirements-disabled_reason)\n- [Accounts to review\npage](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard/review-actionable-accounts)\n- [address the outstanding\nrequirements](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard/managing-individual-accounts#actions-required)\n- [prohibited or restricted\nbusinesses](https://stripe.com/legal/restricted-businesses)",
