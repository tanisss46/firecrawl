The scheduled\npayments feature lets your customers take action immediately so that they won’t\nforget to pay. Your customers can also go back to the Hosted Invoice Page at any\ntime and update their payment method and or scheduled date.\n\n#### Note\n\nThe scheduled payments feature is currently only available in the US.\n\n![Allow your customer to schedule their\npayments](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/hip-scheduled-payment-web-mobile.0729fa213232ddd1c6470c88d9ad661b.png)\n\nAllow your customers to schedule their payments\n\n## Get started\n\nFrom the [Invoice\ntemplate](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/invoice), you can enable\nor disable scheduled payments for all invoices, including those that are\noutstanding. You can’t leverage the Stripe API to toggle the scheduled payments\nfeature, or receive webhooks when an end merchant schedules a payment.\n\n![Turn on the scheduled payments feature for your\ncustomers](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/settings-scheduled-payments.313042ca8b7e49ee4fa08a0c3c50b8cf.png)\n\nTurn on the scheduled payments feature for your customers\n\nIf your customer chooses to schedule their payment, the invoice appears on your\n[Invoices page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/invoices) under **Scheduled**.\nA badge also appears next to the invoice that indicates the invoice’s scheduled\nstatus. Hovering over the badge tells you the invoice’s scheduled and estimated\ndelivery dates.\n\n## End customer features\n\nAn end customer that receives a Stripe invoice and pays it through the Hosted\nInvoice Page can:\n\n- Choose whether to initiate payment now, or on a future date.\n- See the invoice due date using the calendar popup.\n- Know the estimated date a payment will reach your account.\n- Be warned if the payment delivery is past the due date.\n- Cancel or edit the scheduled payment before the due date.\n\n#### Note\n\nYour customers can still choose to schedule payments past the due date.\n\n![A past due payment\ndelivery](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/hip-scheduled-payment-past-due.a868bc3e45e003425cf46cdf2711342b.png)\n\nA past due payment delivery\n\n## Email notifications\n\nStripe sends email notifications to your customers when a payment has been\nscheduled, and 3 days before the payment initiates (to make sure that they have\nenough funds). Both emails contain a link to the Hosted Invoice Page for\nreference.\n\n#### Note\n\nIf a customer doesn’t have an associated email, they won’t receive payment\nreminders.\n\nAfter Stripe initiates the payment, the customer receives an email receipt. You\ncan also configure Stripe to send email notifications upon failed payment\nattempts, or if your customer’s card on file is about to expire. To learn more,\nsee [Send email reminders](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/send-email).\n\n![Invoicing email\nnotifications](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/hip-scheduled-payment-reminder.69e7aefd8919ce80950bca3727ebfe46.png)\n\nInvoicing email notifications\n\n## Limitations\n\nYour customer faces certain limitations when they use the scheduled payments\nfeature.\n\n### Collection method\n\n- The scheduled payments feature is supported only when\n[collection_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-collection_method)\nis set to `send_invoice`.\n\n### Payment methods\n\n- Only credit cards are supported.\n- Apple and Google Pay aren’t supported.\n- International cards might be declined due to regulatory requirements for\nstep-up authentication (3DS). (We email the customer in these instances.)\n\n### Invoice due dates\n\n- The scheduled payments feature isn’t available if the invoice is due the same\nday, next day, or is already past due.\n- You can’t schedule a payment that’s 60 days or more out from the current date.\nFor example, you can’t schedule a payment for February 21, 2022, if the current\ndate is December 23, 2021.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Hosted Invoice Page](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/hosted-invoice-page)\n- [Use the Dashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/dashboard)\n- [How invoicing works](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/overview)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Hosted Invoice Page](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/hosted-invoice-page)\n- [Invoice template](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/invoice)\n- [Invoices page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/invoices)\n- [Send email reminders](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/send-email)\n-\n[collection_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-collection_method)\n- [Use the Dashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/dashboard)\n- [How invoicing works](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/overview)",
