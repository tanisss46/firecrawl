You\nreceive the full amount (minus a fee) as if it were a normal charge, and the\ncustomer’s bank handles collecting the money over time.\n\nStripe supports installment payments for Stripe Mexico accounts using the\nPayment Intents and Payment Methods APIs, Checkout, Invoicing, and Payment\nLinks.\n\nPayment Element support for meses sin intereses is in private preview. To get\naccess, contact [Stripe support](https://support.stripe.com/?contact=true).\n\nPayment method propertiesCountry availability- **Customer locations**\n\nMexico\n- **Presentment currency**\n\nMXN\n- **Payment confirmation**\n\nCustomer-initiated\n- **Payment method family**\n\nCards\n- **Recurring payments**\n\nYes\n- **Payout timing**\n\nStandard payout timing applies\n- **Connect support**\n\n[Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/mx-installments#connect-compatibility)\n- **Dispute support**\n\nYes\n- **Manual capture support**\n\nYes\n- **Refunds / Partial refunds**\n\nYes / yes\n\n## Get started\n\nGet started with accepting\n[installments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/meses-sin-intereses/accept-a-payment).\n\n## Connect\n\nYou can use [Stripe Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/how-connect-works)\nwith installments to process payments on behalf of connected accounts. As a\nplatform, you can set the default installment configuration for your connected\naccounts in Mexico. Standard connected accounts can override these settings in\nthe Dashboard.\n\n## Connectors and plugins\n\nA variety of connectors and plugins that integrate with Stripe also support\ninstallments. These connectors provide no-code and low-code solutions for\naccepting a wide range of local payment methods using Stripe, including\ninstallments.\n\nFor example, the [latest version of the Stripe Connector for Adobe\nCommerce](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/adobe-commerce/payments/install#upgrade)\nhas built-in support for accepting payments with installments. For information\nregarding setup instructions and features for specific plugins, contact the\nplugin developers directly.\n\nIf you use a plugin that doesn’t yet support installments, you can [contact our\nsupport team](https://support.stripe.com/) to let us know, and we’ll do our best\nto see if we can enable installments for that plugin.\n\n## Fees\n\nWhen you accept a payment with installments, an additional fee is added to the\nstandard credit card transaction fee. The fee varies according to the number of\ninstallments, or months, applied to the transaction.\n\nInstallment Plan DurationDefault Minimum Transaction AmountAdditional Fee %3\nmonths300.00 MXN5%6 months600.00 MXN7.5%9 months900.00 MXN10%12 months1,200.00\nMXN12.5%18 months1,800.00 MXN17.5%24 months2,400.00 MXN22.5\n## Requirements\n\nThere are restrictions on which transactions and cards can use meses sin\nintereses.
