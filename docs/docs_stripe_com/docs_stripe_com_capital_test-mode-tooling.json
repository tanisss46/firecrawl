You can send test offers to the email\naddress of the authenticated account user.\n\n## Create a test mode offer\n\n- Go to the [Capital\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/connect/capital).\n- Toggle **Test Mode** to an active status.\n- To generate a test offer, click **Create** and select the parameters for the\noffer creation.\n\n- For the connected account, select an existing connected account by searching\nfor the account’s ID or leave it blank and Stripe will generate an account for\nyou.\n- You’ll also able to select the type of offer and if it’s a refill, the test\naccount, and the offer terms (amount, fee, and repayment rate).\n- If you prefer to create a new connected account, visit the [Connected Accounts\nOverview Page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/connect/accounts/overview).\n- You might see a message that the connected account needs to add a bank account\nor debit card. For test mode offers, you don’t need to link the bank account.\n\n!\n\nConnected Accounts Overview Page\n\nCreate a new connected account\n\nCreating a connected account\n\nView account details of your newly created connected account:\n`https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/connect/accounts/:merchant_id`\n\n- Click **Create Financing Offer** to create the offer for the test connected\naccount.\n\nThe result is that the financing offer in test mode hasn’t been delivered yet.\nYou can see each financing offer for your customers and\n[Metrics](https://docs.stripe.com/capital/reporting) in the [Capital\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/connect/capital).\n\nNext, you must enable email delivery and access to the offer.\n\n## Enable email delivery and offer access\n\nTo access the offer, mark the offer as delivered. We require offers to be in a\ndelivered state to confirm successful receipt and to maintain a record that\noffers aren’t cherry-picked nor restricted in a discriminatory manner. Users\nwon’t be able to access offers that are in an undelivered state.\n\nYou can mark offers as delivered in two ways:\n\n- You can select the delivered status when you create the test mode financing\noffer since actual offer delivery in an email isn’t necessary for test mode.\n- If you created a test mode financing offer with an undelivered status, you can\nclick the actions dropdown for that offer in the Financing offers table and\nselect **Mark delivered**.\n\n!\n\nMarking offer as Delivered\n\nFor multiple offers, select the checkbox in the upper left corner of the column\ntitles to select all the rows, and then click **Mark delivered** in the top\nright corner.\n\n!\n\nMarking Finance Offers as Delivered (Bulk)\n\n## Send test offer email\n\nAfter you’ve enabled email delivery, you can send a test offer email to your\ninbox. Stripe sends test mode offer emails to the authenticated user to prevent\nreal users from receiving unwanted test mode emails.\n\nIn the actions dropdown for the offer, select **Send offer email** and you’ll\nreceive the Stripe-sent test offer email that uses your platform’s [Connect\nbranding](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/stripe-dashboard/branding).\n\n!\n\nSelect Send Offer Email action\n\n## Accepting the test offer as a user\n\nIf you use Stripe-sent test offer emails, you must complete an account claim and\nverification process for security reasons. Use the following test mode values to\npass this security check:\n\n- **Mobile number**: Use the test phone number option.\n- **Email**: Add any email address as long as the top-level domain is valid. For\nexample, `me@mycompany.com` works in test mode, but `test@test.test` doesn’t\nwork.\n- **Verify your phone number**: Use the test code option.\n\nAfter you pass this verification process, you can view the test offer and apply\nfor the test loan as if you were the user.\n\nYou can also access the offer by clicking the ** Dashboard link** option and\nloading the copied link in your browser.\n\n## Approve or reject the offer\n\nAfter you accept the test offer as the user, the offer transitions to an\naccepted status in the Stripe Dashboard. To test the loan disbursement:\n\n- Go to the Financing Reporting page.\n- Navigate to the test offer’s detailed Financing page and click **… > approve\nand disburse funds**.\n- Click **Approve** to initiate the disbursal of funds.\n\n## Financing reporting\n\nNow that you have a financing with a `paid_out` status, retrieve the link for\nthe active Financing reporting page. This page displays key details around the\nfinancing loan such as outstanding balance, repayment activity, and the ability\nto make manual payments or download the contract.\n\nTo retrieve this link:\n\n- Navigate to the test offer’s detailed Financing page and click **… > \nDashboard link**.\n- Load this copied link in your browser and pass through the standard\nverification steps to access the active Financing reporting page.\n\n## Activate automatic offers to finalize integration\n\nAfter sending test and pilot offers, you can enable Stripe to send automatic\noffers to all eligible and pre-approved users. Stripe disables automatic offers\nby default to allow you to manually generate and test offers. To enable\nautomatic offers:\n\n- Go to the [Capital Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/capital).\n- Select **Manage offers** and confirm that you want to activate automatic\noffers. The result is that all eligible users with an email automatically\nreceive a financing offer as soon as it’s available.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/connect/capital)\n- [Connected Accounts Overview\nPage](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/connect/accounts/overview)\n- [Metrics](https://docs.stripe.com/capital/reporting)\n- [Connect\nbranding](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/stripe-dashboard/branding)\n- [Capital Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/capital)",
