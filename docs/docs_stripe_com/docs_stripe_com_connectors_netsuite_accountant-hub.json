Some benefits include:\n\n- Automatic creation of entries for customers, invoices, income, and accounts\nreceivable. When using Stripe Billing subscriptions, Stripe provides revenue\nrecognition data for invoice line items.\n- Automatic application of payments and refunds to the corresponding invoices\nand credit memos.\n- Integration of the dispute lifecycle into NetSuite, including automation of\nthe income, cash, and fees associated with won or lost disputes.\n- Automatic bank reconciliation on the transaction level, including the amount\nand date of the deposit.\n\n### Onboarding\n\n[Getting startedWork with an official implementation partner to choose your plan\nand set up
