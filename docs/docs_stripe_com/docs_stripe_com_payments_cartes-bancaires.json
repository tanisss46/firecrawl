  "content": "# Cartes Bancaires (CB)\n\n## Learn about Cartes Bancaires, a common payment method in France.\n\nCartes Bancaires is France’s local card network. More than 95% of these cards\nare co-branded with either Visa or Mastercard, meaning you can process these\ncards over either Cartes Bancaires or the Visa or Mastercard networks.\nBusinesses processing co-badged cards in the EEA must provide customers a choice\nof which network they prefer at checkout time. See our [guide for co-badged\ncards compliance](https://docs.stripe.com/co-badged-cards-compliance) for more\ninformation.\n\nCartes Bancaires can have a positive effect on your acceptance rate in France.\nIf a charge is declined on the Cartes Bancaires network for a technical reason,\nStripe [automatically retries the\ncharge](https://stripe.com/payments/features#authorization) on Visa or\nMastercard’s networks.\n\nPayment method propertiesBusiness locationsProduct support- **Customer\nlocations**\n\nEurope\n- **Presentment currency**\n\nEUR\n- **Payment confirmation**\n\nCustomer-initiated\n- **Payment method family**\n\nCards\n- **Recurring payments**\n\nYes\n- **Payout timing**\n\nStandard payout timing applies\n- **Connect support**\n\nYes\n- **Dispute support**\n\n[Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/cartes-bancaires#disputes)\n- **Manual capture support**\n\nYes\n- **Multicapture support**\n\nYes\n- **Refunds / Partial refunds**\n\nYes / Yes\n\n## Availability\n\nIf your business isn’t based in France, Cartes Bancaires won’t be fully enabled\nuntil your account has processed 50 EUR from Cartes Bancaires eligible cards.\nFrench Stripe accounts with the “type of business” set as “Particulier /\nMicro-entrepreneur / Auto-entrepreneur” are eligible for Cartes Bancaires after\nproviding their business tax ID in the Dashboard settings.\n\n## Disputes\n\nAs with Visa and Mastercard, cardholders can dispute Cartes Bancaires charges.\nBecause Cartes Bancaires dispute rules are more stringent, there are fewer\nreasons that a cardholder can dispute a charge, which on average leads to a\nlower dispute rate compared to Visa and Mastercard. Businesses can’t contest\nCartes Bancaires disputes—the dispute fee is 0 Euro on Cartes Bancaires.\n\n## Integration\n\nIf you can already [accept card\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment), you can accept\nCartes Bancaires. See the [co-badged cards compliance\nguide](https://docs.stripe.com/co-badged-cards-compliance) to learn how to best\nhandle customer priority selection, and to find multiple test cards that you can\nuse to test your integration as soon as it’s active. If you require that Cartes\nBancaires is never the default network for any payments, please contact\n[support](https://support.stripe.com/contact).\n\n## Links\n\n- [guide for co-badged cards\ncompliance](https://docs.stripe.com/co-badged-cards-compliance)\n- [automatically retries the\ncharge](https://stripe.com/payments/features#authorization)\n- [Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/cartes-bancaires#disputes)\n- [accept card payments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment)\n- [support](https://support.stripe.com/contact)",
