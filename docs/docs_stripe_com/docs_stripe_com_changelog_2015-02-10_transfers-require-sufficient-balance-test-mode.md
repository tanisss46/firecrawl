# Transfers now require a sufficient account balance in test mode to better simulate live modeBreaking changes

## What’s new

Updates test mode transfers to require sufficient funds in your available test
mode balance (for consistency with live mode transfers). Add funds directly to
your available test mode balance, bypassing the pending balance, by creating a
charge using the special test card number *4000 0000 0000 0077*.

## Impact

Test mode transfers now require sufficient funds, aligning with live mode
behavior.
