# Stripe Tax

## Automate sales tax, VAT, and GST compliance on all your transactions—low or no code integrations available.

You can integrate Stripe Tax with [Payment
Links](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/payment-links) or [Checkout Sessions
API](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/taxes) and use it for
[subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/subscriptions) and
[invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/invoicing). You can also create [custom
payment flows](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/custom) or integrate Stripe Tax as a
platform with [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/connect).

If you work for a platform that pays you through Stripe, you need a 1099 form to
file your taxes. Visit the [Support
site](https://support.stripe.com/express/topics/1099-tax-forms) to learn more
about how to verify your tax information and receive your forms.
