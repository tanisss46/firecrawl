As a platform, you can use Stripe tax to offer\npre-integrated tax compliance to your connected accounts.\n\nUse this guide if your connected accounts are responsible for collecting,\nfiling, and reporting taxes.\n\n- [Set up your connected accounts for\ntax](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-for-platforms#check-set-up)\n- (Optional) [Assign tax codes to the product\ncatalog](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-for-platforms#assign-product-tax-codes)\n- [Integrate tax calculation and\ncollection](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-for-platforms#enable-tax-collection)\n- [Access Stripe Tax\nReports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-for-platforms#access-reports)\n[Set up your connected accounts for\ntax](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-for-platforms#set-up)\nAs a platform, you must make sure that a connected account has their [tax\nsettings and registrations set up](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/set-up) before\nenabling tax calculations. This can be achieved by:\n\n### Connected account using the Stripe Dashboard\n\n### Creating a tax interface within your platform\n\n### Using Connect embedded components within your platform\n\nYour platform must then check whether connected accounts have configured Stripe\nTax to enable tax calculations.\n\n#### Note\n\n[Sign\nin](https://dashboard.stripe.com/login?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.stripe.com%2Ftax%2Ftax-for-platforms)\nto check if your connected accounts are ready to use Stripe Tax.\n\nOn the Dashboard, you can [filter the accounts that are ready to use Stripe\nTax](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/accounts/overview?connected_merchant%5Btax_settings_status%5D=active).\nYou can also export the accounts from the [connected account overview\npage](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/accounts/overview) with the following\nStripe Tax-related columns:\n\n- **Tax Settings Status**: the value `active` indicates that the account is\nready to use Stripe Tax. The value `pending` indicates that some required fields\nare\n[missing](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax/settings/object#tax_settings_object-status_details-pending-missing_fields).\n- **Tax Threshold Status**: the value `exceeded` indicates that the account’s\ncalculated sales or transactions are over the location’s threshold, and the\nbusiness likely needs to register for tax. For more information, see [Monitor\nyour obligations](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/monitoring).\n- **Tax Registration Status**: the value `active` indicates that the account has\nat least one active [tax registration](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/registering).\n\nYou can also check whether an account has configured Stripe Tax by [using the\nTax Settings API](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/settings-api#checking-settings).\n\n[Assign tax codes to the product\ncatalogOptional](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-for-platforms#assign-product-tax-codes)\nTo calculate taxes, Stripe Tax requires classifying products into their tax\ncodes. One way to do this is to [supply a preset tax code for each connected\naccount](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/settings-api#updating-settings), which is\nprobably sufficient if your connected accounts typically sell a single category\nof items.\n\nHowever, you might offer your users more control by allowing them to map Tax\nCodes to each product. You can retrieve a list of [supported product tax\ncodes](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes) from the Stripe [Tax Code\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_codes). You can also allow a subset of this\nlist if your connected accounts only sell specific types of products.\n\n[Integrate tax calculation and\ncollection](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-for-platforms#enable-tax-collection)\nYou need to integrate with Stripe Tax to calculate taxes as part of your\ncheckout flow.\n\n### Payment Links\n\n### Payment Links for one-time payments\n\n### Payment Links for subscriptions\n\n### Checkout\n\n### Checkout Sessions for one-time payments\n\n### Checkout Sessions for subscriptions\n\n### Billing\n\n### Subscriptions\n\n### Invoicing\n\n### Custom flows using the Stripe Tax API\n\n### Payment Intents\n\n### Off-Stripe payments\n\nAfter you implement it, Stripe automatically starts collecting tax in\njurisdictions where the user has an active registration.\n\n#### Note\n\nIndependent of the integration, your connected account receives a credit for the\ncollected tax amount by default.\n\n[Access Stripe Tax\nReports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-for-platforms#access-reports)\nYour connected accounts can use [Stripe Tax\nreports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports) to help them correctly file and\nremit tax.\n\n### Connected account use the Stripe Dashboard\n\n### Use the Stripe API\n\n## See also\n\n- [Calculate tax in your custom checkout\nflow](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/custom)\n\n## Links\n\n- [50 countries](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries)\n- [tax settings and registrations set up](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/set-up)\n- [Sign\nin](https://dashboard.stripe.com/login?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.stripe.com%2Ftax%2Ftax-for-platforms)\n- [filter the accounts that are ready to use Stripe\nTax](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/accounts/overview?connected_merchant%5Btax_settings_status%5D=active)\n- [connected account overview\npage](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/accounts/overview)\n-\n[missing](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax/settings/object#tax_settings_object-status_details-pending-missing_fields)\n- [Monitor your obligations](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/monitoring)\n- [tax registration](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/registering)\n- [using the Tax Settings\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/settings-api#checking-settings)\n- [supply a preset tax code for each connected\naccount](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/settings-api#updating-settings)\n- [supported product tax codes](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes)\n- [Tax Code API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_codes)\n- [Stripe Tax reports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports)\n- [Calculate tax in your custom checkout\nflow](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/custom)",
