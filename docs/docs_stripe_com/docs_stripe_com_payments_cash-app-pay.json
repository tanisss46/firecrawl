  "content": "# Cash App Pay payments\n\n## Learn about Cash App Pay, a digital wallet popular with US customers.\n\nCash App is a popular consumer app in the US that allows customers to bank,\ninvest, send, and receive money using their digital wallet.\n\nCash App Pay is a payment method available to all Cash App customers for single\nuse and recurring payments to businesses. Cash App Pay uses the customer’s\nstored balance or linked debit card to fund the payment. The customer can\nconfirm the payment in one of two ways:\n\n- During checkout from a mobile device, your site redirects customers to the\nCash App mobile application for authentication. The payment is authenticated\nduring the redirect. No additional action is needed in the Cash App mobile\napplication to complete the purchase. The customer is then redirected back to\nyour site.\n- During checkout from a desktop web application, the customer scans a QR code\nwith their mobile device to authenticate the transaction.\nPayment method propertiesBusiness locationsProduct support- **Customer\nlocations**\n\nUS customers (excluding accounts in US territories).\n- **Presentment currency**\n\nUSD\n- **Payment confirmation**\n\nCustomer-initiated\n- **Payment method family**\n\nWallet\n- **Billing support**\n\nYes\n- **Payout timing**\n\nStandard payout timing applies\n- **Connect support**\n\n[Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/cash-app-pay#connect)\n- **Dispute support**\n\n[Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/cash-app-pay#disputes-and-fraud)\n- **Manual capture support**\n\nYes\n- **Refunds / Partial refunds**\n\n[Yes / Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/cash-app-pay#refunds)\n\n## Payment flow\n\nBelow is a demonstration of the Cash App payment flow from your checkout page:\n\n## Get started\n\nTo get started, see [Accept a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/cash-app-pay/accept-a-payment).\n\nYou don’t have to integrate Cash App Pay and other payment methods individually.\nIf you use our front-end products, Stripe automatically determines the most\nrelevant payment methods to display. Go to the [Stripe\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and enable\nCash App Pay. To get started with one of our hosted UIs, follow a quickstart:\n\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart): Our prebuilt, hosted\ncheckout page.\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart): Our drop-in UI\ncomponents.\n\n### Other payment products\n\nThe following Stripe products also let you add Cash App Pay from the Dashboard:\n\n- [Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/no-code-guide)\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n- [Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview)\n\n## Branding\n\nBoost conversion by letting your customers know you accept payments with Cash\nApp Pay by including their approved [brand\nassets](https://developers.cash.app/docs/api/resources/Cash-App-Pay-assets) on\nyour website.\n\n## Payment limits and options\n\nWhile there are no business level minimum or maximum limits enforced, Cash App\nsets variable customer level limits for sending and receiving money. This limit\nis based on a number of factors such as verification status of the customer’s\naccount and transaction history. Use Cash App Pay for lower value orders (for\nexample, below 2000 USD) to reduce the likelihood of a decline.\n\nCash App Pay uses either the customer’s Cash App balance or linked debit card to\nfund the transaction. By default, Cash App Pay uses the customer’s Cash App\nbalance if the balance can cover the entirety of the order amount. Otherwise, it\nuses the customer’s linked debit card. A Cash App customer can’t combine payment\noptions for a single order (for example, using the balance for part of the order\namount and debit card for the remainder).\n\n## Prohibited and restricted business categories\n\nIn addition to the categories of [businesses restricted from using Stripe\noverall](https://stripe.com/legal/restricted-businesses), the following\ncategories are prohibited from using Cash App Pay:\n\n- B2B businesses\n- Financial services\n- Businesses accepting Cash App Pay for gift card purchases\n\nPlatforms focused on fundraising, donations, and alcohol sales must seek\nadditional approvals from Stripe. Contact us for additional information.\n\n## Refunds\n\nReturns are subject to the return policy that you display on your website. If\nyour business allows returns, you can [refund](https://docs.stripe.com/refunds)\nCash App Pay transactions as you normally would for card payments. Cash App Pay\nsupports partial or full refunds for up to 90 days after the original purchase,\nand processes them asynchronously. After Stripe initiates a refund, Cash App Pay\nissues the refund to the customer’s original form of payment (either their Cash\nApp balance or linked debit card).\n\nStripe notifies you of the final refund status using the\n[refund.updated](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-refund.updated)\nor\n[refund.failed](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-refund.failed)\n[webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) event. When a refund succeeds, the\n[Refund](https://docs.stripe.com/api/refunds/object) object’s status transitions\nto `succeeded`. If the refund fails, the Refund object’s status transitions to\n`failed` and Stripe returns the amount to your Stripe balance. In these cases,\nyou need to arrange an alternative way of providing your customer with a refund.\n\n## Disputes\n\nCustomers must authenticate Cash App Pay payments by logging in to their Cash\nApp account. This requirement helps reduce the risk of fraud or unrecognized\npayments. Cash App takes financial liability for any losses due to customer\nfraud.\n\nCustomers can dispute Cash App Pay payments in certain cases—for example, if\nthey’re unaware of the transaction, don’t receive the goods or services, receive\nduplicate charges for the same transaction, or cancel the transaction without\nreceiving a refund. Customers have 120 calendar days to file a dispute from the\ndate of the original charge, or in situations where they didn’t receive goods,\n120 calendar days from the expected receipt date.\n\nIf the Cash App Pay payment used the customer’s linked debit card as the\nunderlying source for payment, customers can initiate a dispute in one of the\nfollowing ways:\n\n- Directly with their issuing financial institution.\n- Directly with Cash App. This is the only option for payments that use the Cash\nApp stored balance as the underlying source.\n\nAfter the customer initiates a dispute, Stripe notifies you using:\n\n- Email notification\n- The Stripe Dashboard\n- An API\n[charge.dispute.created](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-charge.dispute.created)\nevent (if your integration is set up to receive\n[webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks))\n\nWhen a customer creates a dispute, Stripe deducts the amount of the dispute and\nassociated dispute fee from your Stripe balance until Cash App Pay resolves the\ndispute. Stripe requests that you upload compelling evidence that you fulfilled\nthe purchase order using the [Stripe\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/responding#respond). This evidence\ncan include:\n\n- Received return confirmation (for shipped goods returned from the customer to\nyou)\n- Tracking ID\n- Shipping date\n- Record of purchase for intangible goods, such as IP address or email receipt\n- Record of purchase for services or physical goods, such as phone number or\nproof of receipt\n\nIf you prefer to handle disputes programmatically, you can [respond to disputes\nusing the API](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/api).\n\nYou must submit the requested information within 13 calendar days. Cash App Pay\nmakes a decision within 58 calendar days of dispute creation. If Cash App Pay\nresolves the dispute with you winning, Stripe returns the disputed amount to\nyour Stripe balance. If they rule in favor of the customer, the balance charge\nbecomes permanent.\n\n## Statement descriptors\n\nEvery Cash App Pay payment appears on the customer’s bank statement with the\n`CashApp*` prefix attached to the merchant name. The merchant name is set to the\n[company.name](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-company-name)\nfield.\n\nUnlike cards, Cash App Pay does not support a dynamic statement descriptor to be\nset at the transaction level. This means that the `statement_descriptor` value\nin a PaymentIntent request is ignored for Cash App Pay payments.\n\n## Connect\n\nIf you use [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect), take the following into\nconsideration before you enable and use Cash App Pay:\n\n### Request Cash App Pay capabilities for your connected accounts\n\nSet the `cashapp_payments` capability to `active` on your platform account, and\nfor any connected accounts you want to enable for Cash App Pay. You can do this\nwithout code by navigating to the [Stripe\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and making\nsure Cash App Pay is on by default for your connected accounts, or you can\n[request the account\ncapability](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities#requesting-unrequesting).\n\n### Business of record and statement descriptors\n\nThe [charge type](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges) of Connect payments\nmight change the default statement descriptor and the business name that appears\non the customer’s bank statement. The charge type can also change the business\nof record shown on:\n\n- The Cash App customer interface\n- Customer confirmation emails from Cash App\n- The mandate when [saving payment\ndetails](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/cash-app-pay/set-up-payment)\nCharge typeDescriptor taken fromDirectConnected\nAccountDestinationPlatformSeparate charge and transferPlatformDestination (with\n`on_behalf_of` using a platform saved payment method)PlatformSeparate charge and\ntransfer (with `on_behalf_of` using a platform saved payment\nmethod)PlatformDestination (with `on_behalf_of` not using a platform saved\npayment method)Connected AccountSeparate charge and transfer (with\n`on_behalf_of` not using a platform saved payment method)Connected Account\nA “platform saved payment method” is a payment method created through\nPaymentIntent or SetupIntent without using the `on_behalf_of` parameter. Thus,\nthe saved payment method belongs to the platform account.\n\nTo save a customer from repeated authentications for Destination `on_behalf_of`\ncharges, platforms often save a payment method for the customer, then use it for\noff session Destination `on_behalf_of` charges.\n\n### PaymentMethod cloning\n\nYou can save a customer’s Cash App Pay payment method for recurring purchases\nbut the saved Cash App Pay payment method can only be used with the business of\nrecord that the customer authorized off-session use for. This means that Connect\nusers can’t\n[clone](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges-multiple-accounts#clone-and-create-direct-charges)\nCash App Pay payment methods across different connected accounts when the\nconnected accounts act as the business of record.\n\n## Links\n\n- [pricing details](https://stripe.com/pricing/local-payment-methods)\n- [Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/cash-app-pay#connect)\n- [Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/cash-app-pay#disputes-and-fraud)\n- [Yes / Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/cash-app-pay#refunds)\n- [Accept a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/cash-app-pay/accept-a-payment)\n- [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods)\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart)\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart)\n- [Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/no-code-guide)\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n- [Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview)\n- [brand\nassets](https://developers.cash.app/docs/api/resources/Cash-App-Pay-assets)\n- [businesses restricted from using Stripe\noverall](https://stripe.com/legal/restricted-businesses)\n- [refund](https://docs.stripe.com/refunds)\n-\n[refund.updated](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-refund.updated)\n-\n[refund.failed](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-refund.failed)\n- [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks)\n- [Refund](https://docs.stripe.com/api/refunds/object)\n-\n[charge.dispute.created](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-charge.dispute.created)\n- [Stripe Dashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/responding#respond)\n- [respond to disputes using the API](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/api)\n-\n[company.name](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-company-name)\n- [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)\n- [request the account\ncapability](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities#requesting-unrequesting)\n- [charge type](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges)\n- [saving payment\ndetails](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/cash-app-pay/set-up-payment)\n-\n[clone](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges-multiple-accounts#clone-and-create-direct-charges)",
