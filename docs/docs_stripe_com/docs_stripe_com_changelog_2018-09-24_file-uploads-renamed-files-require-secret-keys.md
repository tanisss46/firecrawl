# Renames the FileUpload object to Files, which now require secret keys to download filesBreaking changes

## What’s new

Renames `FileUpload` to `File` for all objects. Additionally, the `url`
attribute now contains an authenticated URL, eliminating the need to use your
secret API key to download the file’s contents. You can [create a file
link](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_file_link) to obtain a
publicly-accessible URL for the file.

## Impact

This change renames `FileUpload` objects to `File` objects and introduces
authenticated URLs for file access, requiring secret API keys for downloads. You
now have more secure file management, with the ability to create public file
links when needed.
