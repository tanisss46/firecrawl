  "content": "# Instant Payouts for Connect\n\n## Offer connected accounts immediate access to their funds with instant payouts.\n\nAvailable in: \nWith Instant Payouts, Connect platforms and marketplaces can allow their users\nto access their balances immediately following a successful charge. Instant\nPayouts are available at any day or time, including weekends and holidays, and\nfunds typically settle in the associated bank account within 30 minutes.\n\nYou can use Instant Payouts to:\n\n- Attract and retain new users\n- Realize additional revenue by [assessing a\nfee](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/instant-payouts#monetization-and-fees)\n\nFunds acquired from card payments are available for Instant Payouts as soon as\nthe charge is complete. ACH or bank debits are only available for Instant\nPayouts after the payment has settled.\n\n## Eligible connected accounts\n\nInstant Payouts are only available for connected accounts that are in the same\ncountry as the platform and must use the local currency.\n\n### External Account eligibility\n\nTo receive Instant Payouts, a user must have an eligible external account. An\nexternal account in the context of Stripe Connect refers to a bank account or\ndebit card associated with a connected account, and eligiblity varies by\ncountry.\n\nIf you’re responsible for connected accounts (including Custom and Express\naccounts), that might not be able to refund negative balances, enable\nStripe-hosted onboarding and dashboard interfaces to collect debit card details.\nTo enable this, navigate to your [External Account\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/payouts/external_accounts),\nand under **Allow debit cards?**, select **Yes**.\n\nCountryEligible External Account TypeUSDebit card; some bank accounts ([check\nsupported banks](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts/instant-payouts-banks))Canada,\nSingapore, AustraliaDebit card ([check supported\nbanks](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts/instant-payouts-banks))United Kingdom,\nEuropean UnionBank account ([check supported\nbanks](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts/instant-payouts-banks))\nYou can verify Instant Payout eligibility for your user by calling the [External\nAccounts API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/external_account_bank_accounts/list)\nwith the Connected Account ID. The response returns the account’s 10 most\nrecently active External Accounts, and those with `instant` in the\n`available_payout_methods` parameter are eligible for Instant Payouts. You can\npaginate through the results if you need to review more than the default display\nof 10.\n\n```\n{\n \"object\": \"list\",\n \"data\": [\n {\n \"object\": \"bank_account\",\n \"available_payout_methods\": [\n \"standard\",\n \"instant\"\n ],\n ...\n }\n ],\n}\n```\n\n### Invite users to add eligible accounts\n\nIf your user doesn’t have an External Account eligible for Instant Payouts, you\ncan prompt them to add an eligible account through the [Account\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/update#update_account-external_account).\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts/{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}} \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d external_account={{BANK_ACCOUNT_TOKEN_ID}}\n```\n\n## Monetization and fees\n\nSome marketplaces and platforms choose to monetize Instant Payouts, offering the\nconvenience for a fee. If you monetize Instant Payouts, Stripe supports two\nmethods of fee collection: Application Fees and account debits\n\n### Application Fees\n\nWith [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees), Stripe\ncollects the fee you determine and initiates the Instant Payout synchronously.\nStripe recommends applying an application fee because it’s a single, seamless\ntransaction:\n\n- Users can’t pay out more than their available balance\n- Fees can be refunded through the API or the Dashboard\n- Monetization options include fixed or variable fees with minimums and maximums\n- Fees are paired to your Instant Payouts revenue with the [Payout\nObject](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payouts/object), helping with reporting and\nreconciliation. You can view your collected fees in the [Payments\ntab](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/application_fees) on the Dashboard\n\nTo use Application Fees, set your pricing structure using the\n[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/payouts/instant-payouts).\n\n#### Caution\n\nApplication Fees for Instant Payouts rely on the [Balance API\nnet-of-fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/balance/balance_object#balance_object-instant_available-net_available)\nfield. Turning this on without using the new field could break your API\nintegration.\n\n### Account Debits\n\nYou can [directly debit](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-debits) your\nconnected account’s Stripe balance and credit your platform account’s Stripe\nbalance to collect fees. After the Instant Payout, call the [Charge\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_charge), specifying the connected\naccount ID as the `source` parameter. Consider the following limitations when\nusing account debits to collect Instant Payout fees:\n\n- You must get legally binding consent from your connected accounts.\n- Account debits carry an [additional cost](https://stripe.com/connect/pricing).\n- Debiting an account can’t make the connected account balance become negative\nunless you have [reserves\nenabled](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-balances#understanding-connected-reserve-balances)\n(on by default for all new platforms created after January 31, 2017) and have a\nbank account in the same currency as the debit.\n- If the connected account has already paid out their available balance in full,\nyou might be delayed in collecting the fee.\n- Reconciliation requires maintaining an internal database of debits and related\npayouts.\n\n## Initiate an Instant Payout\n\nYou can initiate Instant Payouts either manually on your users’ behalf or you\ncan use the Stripe APIs to compose user interfaces to allow your users to\ninitiate an Instant Payout. In circumstances where you initiate Instant Payouts\non your users’ behalf, you may only do so in accordance with instructions and\nauthorizations given by your users.\n\nAPIEmbedded ComponentsDashboard- Call [retrieve\nbalance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/balance/balance_retrieve), expanding\n[instant_available-net_available](https://docs.stripe.com/api/balance/balance_object#balance_object-instant_available-net_available).\n\nThe property `instant_available.net_available` is the connected account’s\ninstant balance net of platform fees for each instantly available destination.\nYou must use this field if you’re monetizing with [Application\nFees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/instant-payouts#application-fees). This\namount is calculated from the platform’s Application Fee pricing structure set\nin the Dashboard.\n\nThe property `instant_available.amount` is the connected account’s gross\nbalance, not including any platform fees.\n\nThe following example shows a platform setting 2% pricing for any USD Instant\nPayout:\n\n```\ncurl -G https://api.stripe.com/v1/balance \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -H \"Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}\" \\\n -d \"expand[]\"=\"instant_available.net_available\"\n```\n\n```\n{\n \"object\": \"balance\",\n \"available\": [\n {\n \"amount\": 500,\n \"currency\": \"usd\",\n \"source_types\": {\n \"card\": 500\n }\n }\n ],\n \"instant_available\": [\n {\n \"amount\": 500,\n \"currency\": \"usd\",\n \"net_available\": [\n {\n \"amount\": 490,\n \"destination\": \"ba_abc123\",\n \"source_types\": {\n \"card\": 490\n }\n }\n ],\n \"source_types\": {\n \"card\": 500\n }\n }\n ],\n ...\n}\n```\n\n#### Note\n\nFunds from card charges are available immediately, but funds from bank debits\n(such as ACH) aren’t available immediately.\n\nKey considerations:\n\n- `net_available` only appears when included as an [expanded\nparameter](https://docs.stripe.com/expand).\n- `net_available` only appears for connected accounts. You’ll receive an error\nexpanding this for your platform.\n- A hash in `net_available` only appears for instantly-available external\naccounts. External accounts that aren’t valid instant payouts destinations won’t\nappear.\n- External accounts can have different `net_available` balances based on\nexternal account properties and platform-set pricing rules.\n- Call [create payout](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payouts/create) with\n`method=instant`. Use the amount field corresponding with your monetization\nstrategy, either `instant_available.amount` or\n`instant_available.net_available[0].amount`. Use the `destination` from the\nbalance endpoint to pay out to an intended external account.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payouts \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -H \"Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}\" \\\n -d amount=490 \\\n -d currency=usd \\\n -d method=instant \\\n -d destination={{BANK_ACCOUNT_TOKEN_ID}}\n```\n\n#### Caution\n\nInstant payouts to ineligible external accounts will fail, so [confirm\neligibility](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/instant-payouts#external-account-eligibility)\nbefore surfacing the capability to your connected accounts.\n\n- View your [application\nfee](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fee/retrieve) that was created by\nthe payout.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/application_fees/{{APPLICATION_FEE_ID}} \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\"\n```\n\n## Eligibility and daily volume limits\n\nYour account has a maximum amount it can pay out instantly per day across all\nconnected accounts. Your users can’t initiate Instant Payouts after you reach\nyour daily limit. Daily limits reset at midnight US Central Time (CT).\n\n## Pricing\n\nIrrespective of your monetization decisions, Stripe charges marketplaces and\nplatforms a 1% fee for all Instant Payouts. Each Instant Payout transaction has\na minimum and maximum amount dependent on the currency. These fees are assessed\nas part of your overall Connect fees.\n\nCountryInstant Payout minimumInstant Payout maximumUS0.50 USD9,999 USDCanada0.60\nCAD9,999 CADSingapore0.50 SGD9,999 SGDUnited Kingdom0.40 GBP9,999\nGBPAustralia0.50 AUD9,999 AUDEuropean Union0.40 EUR9,999 EUR\n## Manage risk and eligibility\n\nWhen platforms and marketplaces are liable for losses, you’re liable for\nuncovered negative balances due to refunds or disputes.\n\nStripe recommends setting risk parameters to protect your platform from\nunintended losses. We provide a number of [best practices for managing fraud and\nrisk](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/risk-management/best-practices#fraud),\nsuch as setting trust thresholds like the following:\n\n- Minimum processing volume\n- Days active\n- Chargeback rate\n\n## Marketing\n\nYour marketing of Instant Payouts to Connected Accounts must clearly and\nconspicuously disclose any fees you intend to apply for Instant Payouts.\n\nMake sure your marketing is consistent with Stripe’s marketing of the product,\nwhich states that: “You can request Instant Payouts 24/7, including weekends and\nholidays, and funds typically appear in the associated bank account within 30\nminutes”. Some Instant Payouts might not settle within 30 minutes, and instead\nmight take longer to be credited to the relevant bank account.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Instant Payouts for Stripe Dashboard\nusers](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts/instant-payouts)\n- [External Account\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/payouts/external_accounts)\n- [check supported banks](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts/instant-payouts-banks)\n- [External Accounts\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api/external_account_bank_accounts/list)\n- [Account\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/update#update_account-external_account)\n- [configured with\nproperties](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/update-to-typeless-connect)\n- [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees)\n- [Payout Object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payouts/object)\n- [Payments tab](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/application_fees)\n-\n[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/payouts/instant-payouts)\n- [Balance API\nnet-of-fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/balance/balance_object#balance_object-instant_available-net_available)\n- [directly debit](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-debits)\n- [Charge API](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_charge)\n- [additional cost](https://stripe.com/connect/pricing)\n- [reserves\nenabled](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-balances#understanding-connected-reserve-balances)\n- [retrieve balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/balance/balance_retrieve)\n- [expanded parameter](https://docs.stripe.com/expand)\n- [create payout](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payouts/create)\n- [application fee](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fee/retrieve)\n- [best practices for managing fraud and\nrisk](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/risk-management/best-practices#fraud)",
