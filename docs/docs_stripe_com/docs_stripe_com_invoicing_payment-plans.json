This can expand your\nbilling flexibility. For example, you could first collect a deposit and then the\nbalance amount of a transaction at a later date. Alternatively, you could break\nup dues into more favorable terms for your customers by splitting them up into\nmultiple, smaller increments over time. Stripe reminds your customers of\nupcoming payments that they have to make and shows them a history of past\npayments that they’ve already made. You can use both the Dashboard and the API\nto generate payment plans.\n\n## Limitations\n\nPayment plans are currently a preview feature and have a few important\nlimitations. Make sure that the following limitations don’t conflict with your\nuse case:\n\n- Payment plans aren’t supported by Stripe Revenue Recognition or the Stripe\nConnector for NetSuite.\n- Invoices with payment plans aren’t reflected accurately by Stripe Tax\nobligations monitoring. Consult with your tax advisor.\n- Stripe Tax doesn’t support partial refunds, so tax liability won’t be\nreflected accurately. Consult with your tax advisor.\n- Payment plans don’t auto-charge customers with saved payment details.\nCustomers must return to the payment page to make subsequent payments. You can’t\nuse them with `charge_automatically` invoices.\n- Stripe automatically emails reminders to your customers to complete subsequent\npayments. We send these emails 1 week before payments are due by default.\nSending these emails overrides any email reminder schedules and settings for\none-off invoices. You can turn off the email reminders by disabling the setting\nfor [Send finalized invoices and credit notes to\ncustomers](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/automatic).\n- For Connect users, application fees can’t be set on payment plan-enabled\ninvoices. You can only set fees on PaymentIntents.\n- Additional fields associated with payment plans aren’t available in Sigma.\n- Some Billing Analytics charts (Top Subscribers, Collections) only register\ninvoices that are fully paid. Other charts are unaffected.\n- Subscription invoices can’t have payment plans applied.\n\n#### Note\n\nIf you want to enable [buy now, pay\nlater](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/buy-now-pay-later) for B2C invoices,\nread our [buy now, pay later guide](https://stripe.com/guides/buy-now-pay-later)\nfor more information.\n\n## Interested in getting early access to invoice payment plans?\n\nPlease provide your email address below and our team will contact you soon.\n\nCollect EmailSign upRead our [privacy\npolicy](https://stripe.com/privacy).DashboardAPI\nThis guide shows how to set up and manage payment plans without any code using\nthe [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/dashboard).\n\n[Create an invoice in the Dashboard add line item\ndetails](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/payment-plans#create-invoice)\nIn the Dashboard, [create an\nInvoice](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/dashboard#create-invoice) and add\nrelevant details such as the customer, desired line items, and their prices and\nquantities.\n\n![Create an invoice with the\nDashboard](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/invoice-payment-plans-create-invoice.ea35a3ec40146a37ee1c95ae1849cf7d.png)\n\nCreate an invoice with the Dashboard\n\n[Enable the invoice to collect dues in multiple\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/payment-plans#enable-multiple-payments)\nAfter entering customer and line item details, select **Request in Multiple\nPayments** under **Payment Collection** in the invoice editor to enable payment\nplans on the invoice.\n\nBy default, Stripe sets up a payment plan where the amount due is evenly divided\ninto four payments due over 4 months.\n\n![Enable multiple payments in the\nDashboard](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/invoice-payment-plans-collect-multiple-payments.b9a022fdf84d089a35bc4b4026d035cf.png)\n\nEnable multiple payments in the Dashboard\n\n[Configure individual payments and due\ndates](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/payment-plans#configure-payment-plan)\nTo customize the payment plan, click **Edit payment plans**. You can customize a\npayment plan in the following ways:\n\n- Change due dates or amounts due\n- Add or subtract payments,\n- Relabel the names of individual payments\n\nToggle inputs between absolute values and percentage by selecting the gear next\nto the percentage / fixed amount column.\n\nYou can use **Quick actions** as a shortcut to evenly redistribute amounts\nacross payments or even out amounts that don’t add up to the total amount due\nfor the invoice. By selecting **Use as deposit**, the first payment is relabeled\nas a deposit and the redistribution of amounts due only affects subsequent\npayments. You can’t exit this view unless the sum of all payments is equal to\nthe total amount due on the overall invoice.\n\n![Configure the payment plan through the\nDashboard](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/invoice-payment-plans-configure.17a9ccb6f7b3877c9bf8f83142ec7572.png)\n\nConfigure the payment plan through the Dashboard\n\n[Finalize the\ninvoice](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/payment-plans#finalize-invoice-dashboard)\nAfter customizing the payment plan, finalize and send the invoice by clicking\n**Review invoice**. You can’t finalize an invoice if the amounts of the\nindividual payments don’t add up to the total amount due on the invoice (if, for\nexample, line items were changed after the payment plan was set up).\n\n## Post-finalization actions on invoices\n\nYou can still revise, void, or mark as uncollectible a finalized invoice with a\npayment plan, only before the first payment is received. Additionally, payment\nplans can only be “marked as paid” outside Stripe for the entire remaining\namount due of the invoice, and not for a partial amount.\n\n## Tracking partially paid invoices\n\nPayment plan invoices that have been partially paid display a `partially paid`\nstatus across the Stripe Dashboard. However, if any invoice payments aren’t made\nby their due date, the `overdue` status takes precedence. To view invoice status\nwith the API, review the\n[amounts_due](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-amounts_due)\nand\n[payments](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-payments)\nfields for details.\n\n## Links\n\n- [invoice’s](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n- [Send finalized invoices and credit notes to\ncustomers](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/automatic)\n- [buy now, pay later](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/buy-now-pay-later)\n- [buy now, pay later guide](https://stripe.com/guides/buy-now-pay-later)\n- [privacy policy](https://stripe.com/privacy)\n- [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/dashboard)\n- [create an\nInvoice](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/dashboard#create-invoice)\n-\n[amounts_due](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-amounts_due)\n-\n[payments](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-payments)",
