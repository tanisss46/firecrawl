## When to register for tax collection

about your potential tax registration obligations in Iowa. Stripe also notifies
you with email and Dashboard alerts when you need to register to collect tax.

works](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/monitoring).

Remote sellers must register to collect and remit tax in Iowa when, in the
previous or current calendar year, they exceed a sales threshold of 100,000 USD.

The threshold includes gross sales, including marketplace sales.

If your business is under the threshold, you can voluntarily register for an
Iowa Retailer’s Use Tax (RUT) permit. If you’ve already registered for the RUT
and exceed the economic threshold, cancel your RUT and register for an Iowa
sales tax permit.
