  "content": "# Tax ID Additional Verification\n\n## Learn how to use Stripe Tax ID Additional Verification to collect and verify the Tax ID of your users.\n\nConnect [dynamically requires onboarding\ninformation](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information)\nto keep your [accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/accounts) compliant, but\nyou can influence what information Connect requires in your platform by adding\nadditional verifications (AVs) to accounts. Requesting an additional\nverification requires your connected accounts to provide certain information,\nwhich is then verified.\n\nPlatforms might be subject to IRS fines up to 290 USD per submission if they\nfile 1099s with incorrect information (for example, name or tax ID mismatches).\nThe Tax ID AV provides a way for platforms to collect certified tax IDs\nthroughout the year directly from your connected accounts before issuing 1099s,\nto make sure the appropriate 1099 tax forms use the correct Taxpayer\nIdentification Number (TIN).\n\nThe Tax ID Additional Verification performs a name and TIN check either at the\npersonal level or business level based on [required verification information for\ntaxes](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information-taxes).\n\n## How it works\n\nThe Tax ID Additional Verification allows you to enforce the mandatory\ncollection and verification of tax ID requirements for a connected account.\nPlatforms add requirements for Tax ID collection/verification for a connected\naccount using the [Accounts\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api/connected_accounts).\n\nFor Custom Connect platforms, after you add the requirements on a connected\naccount, your platform can [Create an account\nlink](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links/create) to redirect the user\nfrom your platform to [Connect\nOnboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/express-accounts). Alternatively,\nyou can collect the requirements directly from your platform, and then send it\nto Stripe using [Update an\naccount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/update). For Express Connect\nplatforms, Stripe sends the Express connected accounts an email to complete the\nmissing or invalid requirements using the [Express\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/express-dashboard).\n\nAfter Stripe receives the user’s TIN, we automatically verify it by comparing it\nwith the IRS database. If the IRS database confirms the TIN is a match, the\nrequirements are considered satisfied. If the IRS database doesn’t return a TIN\nmatch with the connected account’s tax details, then enforcement limits are\ntriggered.\n\nPlatforms have full customization in setting **enforcement limits** to determine\nwhen Connected Accounts are required to provide a verified TIN. You can set the\nfollowing enforcement limits to impose disablement of payouts or payouts or\npayments if a verified TIN isn’t on file:\n\n- **Upfront**: Block payouts or payments if a verified TIN isn’t on file\nimmediately.\n- **Volume**: Block payouts or payments if a verified TIN isn’t on file after\nprocessing *x* USD.\n- **Time**: Block payouts or payments if a verified TIN isn’t on file after *x*\ndays.\n- **Combo**: Block payouts or payments if a verified TIN isn’t on file after *x*\ndays or after processing *x* USD.\n\n## Get started\n\nCurrently, access to Stripe’s Tax ID Additional Verification is limited to US\npreview users.
