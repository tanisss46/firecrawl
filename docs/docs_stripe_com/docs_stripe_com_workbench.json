  "content": "# Workbench\n\n## Use Workbench to debug, manage, and grow your Stripe integration.\n\n#### Note\n\nWorkbench replaces the existing [Developers\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/development/dashboard), and we enable\nWorkbench by default for all new Stripe accounts. Configure the setting from the\n[Developers](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/developers) settings in the\nDashboard.\n\nWorkbench provides developer tools to help you debug, manage, and grow your\nStripe integration from your browser, anywhere in the Dashboard. For example,\nusing Workbench you can:\n\n- Review a summary of recent integration errors\n- Inspect API objects, request logs, events, and webhook deliveries\n- Create and manage your webhook endpoint configuration\n- Run API requests using the built-in command line environment, or build them\nwith the API Explorer\n\n**Share your ideas:** improve Workbench by clicking **Share feedback** at the\ntop of the tool with feature requests, bug reports, and feedback.\n\n## Get started\n\nTo use Workbench, you [need a Stripe\naccount](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register). Only users with the\n**Administrator** or **Developer** role have full access to all Workbench tools.\n\n- Sign in to the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/). From the\n**Developers** menu, click [Workbench](https://dashboard.stripe.com/workbench).\n- You can drag the top handle of the Workbench pane to resize it, or you can\nclick the maximize icon () to leave or enter full-screen mode.\n- Click the minimize icon () to collapse Workbench to a taskbar at the bottom of\nthe page, or the expand icon () to reopen the pane. The taskbar lets you quickly\ninspect API objects and includes a notification tray that alerts you to critical\nAPI errors and event activity.\n- To hide the Workbench taskbar, click the collapse icon () to minimize the\ntaskbar to an icon on the right of the Dashboard. Hover over the icon to display\nthe notification tray. Click the icon to reopen the full Workbench pane.\n\nWorkbench includes multiple tools in each tab. Learn more about the\nfunctionality of each tab and how to use it below.\n\n#### Note\n\nTo open or minimize Workbench from anywhere in the Dashboard, press the tilde\nkey (**~**) on your keyboard.\n\n### Use Workbench tools\n\nWhile using Workbench, keep these tools in mind:\n\n- Click ** link** to generate a shareable URL of the current Workbench view.\n- Click **Send feedback** to share ideas or questions with the core development\nteam.\n\n## Overview of your Stripe integration\n\nSee an overview of your account’s API activity in the\n[Overview](https://dashboard.stripe.com/workbench/overview) tab.\n\n- The **API keys** widget displays a list of standard and restricted keys on\nyour account. Click **Manage** to create or update your API keys.\n- The **API versions** widget displays a breakdown of the API versions specified\nby recent API requests to your account. Click **Upgrade available** to [upgrade\nthe default API\nversion](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#how-can-i-upgrade-my-api) of your\nStripe account.\n- The **API requests** and **Webhooks** graphs visualize recent API activity on\nyour account. Choose a time period from the dropdown and the graphs will update\nto reflect that interval.\n- **Recent errors** summarizes the most recent errors on your Stripe account.\n\n!\n\nThe Overview tab shows a quick snapshot of your account’s API activity.\n\n## View recent errors\n\nThe [Errors](https://dashboard.stripe.com/workbench/errors) tab summarizes\nrecent errors for your Stripe account. You can learn more about how to resolve\neach type of API error, and review recent API request logs for each error.\nChoose a time period from the dropdown to see errors from that interval.\n\n!\n\nThe Errors tab summarizes recent API errors and highlights related request logs.\n\nOn the left-hand pane, API errors are grouped by error type. Select an error\ngroup to learn more about the error’s details and impact on your integration.\n\n- The number of **Occurrences** shows how frequently this error has occurred in\nthe specified time period.\n- The **Path** specifies the API endpoint used for requests resulting in this\nerror.\n- The **Source** specifies the user agent used for requests resulting in this\nerror.\n- The **Logs** section summarizes requests logs for the specified API errors.\nClicking on one reveals more details in the **Requests** tab, which provides a\ncomplete and detailed view of relevant request logs.\n\n## Use the Inspector to learn about API objects\n\nUse the [Inspector](https://dashboard.stripe.com/workbench/inspector) to explore\na JSON view of API objects on your Stripe account. To inspect an object, you\ncan:\n\n- Enter an object ID from the **Inspector** tab.\n- Visit a Dashboard page for any object (for example, a `Payment`, `Customer`,\nor `Subscription`) and click the **Inspector** icon (), or open the\n**Inspector** tab in Workbench.\n\n!\n\nThe Inspector shows a JSON view of the API object, and any related API objects,\nrequest logs and events.\n\nWhen inspecting an API object, the Inspector provides several details:\n\n- The left-hand pane shows a **Data map** with a hierarchy of related API\nobjects.\n- The **Overview** tab provides a JSON view of the object.\n- The **Logs** tab shows request logs related to the object.\n- The **Events** tab summarizes recently generated events related to the object.\n\nWhen in a [sandbox](https://docs.stripe.com/sandboxes), the **Edit in API\nExplorer** button preloads the API object into the API Explorer on the **Shell**\ntab. From there, you can update API properties to modify the object.\n\nIf the **Auto-inspect** toggle is on, the Inspector automatically updates to\nshow currently-visible objects as you browse the Dashboard .\n\n## View API request logs\n\nThe [Logs](https://dashboard.stripe.com/workbench/logs) tab includes a list of\nrecent API requests and responses for your Stripe account. Workbench highlights\nrecent errors with suggestions on how to resolve them. You can filter API\nrequests by:\n\n- Date of the request\n- HTTP status (for example, `200`)\n- HTTP method (for example, `POST` or `DELETE`)\n- API endpoint (for example, `/v1/checkout/sessions`)\n- IP address that created the request\n- Source (direct API requests or Dashboard)\n- Account (or specifically when using Connect, the platform or connected\naccounts)\n- API version (for example, `2020-08-27`)\n- Error code (for example, `resource_missing`)\n- Error type (for example, `invalid_request_error`)\n- Error parameter (for example, `line_items[*][price]`)\n\nWorkbench doesn’t automatically refresh this tab in real-time as your account\nreceives new API requests. Click **Refresh logs** to fetch the latest request\nlogs from your Stripe account.\n\n!\n\nThe Logs tool presents a timeline of API activity, with filters for time\nendpoint, response code, and other properties.\n\n## Review recent events on your Stripe account\n\nThe [Events](https://dashboard.stripe.com/workbench/events) tab includes a list\nof recent events on your Stripe account. Click **Refresh events** to fetch the\nlatest events from your Stripe account. You can filter events by:\n\n- Date of the event\n- Delivery status (delivered or failed)\n- Event type (for example, `customer.subscription.created`; you can also use\nwildcards (for example, `customer.*`)\n- API resource (for example, `cus_123`)\n\n!\n\nThe Events tab shows recent activity on your Stripe account. Events can be\ndelivered to webhook endpoints.\n\nClick an event in the list on the left to review the event’s details, payload,\nand attempted deliveries on the right:\n\n- Filter the delivery attempts for a specific event by choosing the\n**Succeeded** or **Failed** tab.\n- From the overflow menu (), click **View webhook endpoint** to see which event\ndestination this event was sent to.\n- Click **Resend** on a delivery attempt to resend that event to the webhook\nendpoint.\n\nLearn more about [managing webhook\nendpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/workbench/event-destinations) with Workbench.\n\n## Manage webhook endpoints\n\nYou can create a new webhook endpoint for Stripe to deliver events to in the\n[Webhooks](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks) tab.\n\n- URL endpoints using webhooks\n- Your local machine using the [Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli)\n\n### Create a new endpoint\n\nClick **Create new endpoint** to configure a new webhook endpoint that Stripe\nsends events to. Select the API version that Stripe uses to generate webhook\nevents and the event types to listen for, and specify an HTTPS URL where your\nserver hosts the webhook endpoint.\n\nOn the left, Workbench lists any configured webhook endpoints. The **Overview**\nsummarizes the activity on that configured endpoint, and **Event deliveries**\nprovides a complete list of attempts by Stripe to deliver events to that\nendpoint. Click **Retry now** next to any delivery attempt so Stripe can\nredeliver the event to that endpoint.\n\n!\n\nSet up a new webhook endpoint or route events to your local development machine.\n\n## Run API commands using Shell and Explorer\n\n[Shell](https://dashboard.stripe.com/workbench/shell) provides a command line\ninterface to manage your Stripe resources within Workbench, similar to the\n[Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli). See [Shell and API\nExplorer](https://docs.stripe.com/workbench/shell) for the full list of\navailable commands.\n\n#### Note\n\nShell is read-only in live mode. Switch to a\n[sandbox](https://docs.stripe.com/sandboxes) to run API requests that create,\nmodify, or delete API objects.\n\nWhen using Workbench, a minimal Shell is always available in the pane, or you\ncan use the **Shell** tab to launch a full-screen session. From the **Shell**\ntab, click **New pane** to split the pane into multiple shell sessions.\n\nClick **API Explorer** to reveal the interactive command builder on the right.\nChoose the API resource and HTTP method to show the required and optional\nparameters for that request. The **Headers** tab allows setting some HTTP\nheaders, such as the [Stripe-Account\nheader](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/authentication#stripe-account-header)\nwhich allows making API requests to a connected account. Click **Run** to\nexecute the API request.\n\nFilling in parameters in the API Explorer automatically constructs the\ncorresponding Shell command. Select a programming language, then click **Print\nSDK request** to see the corresponding SDK code for the API request.\n\n!\n\nShell and the API Explorer help you experiment with Stripe’s API from Workbench.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Use cases](https://docs.stripe.com/workbench/guides)\n- [Manage event\ndestinations](https://docs.stripe.com/workbench/event-destinations)\n- [Try the Shell and API Explorer](https://docs.stripe.com/workbench/shell)\n- [Keyboard shortcuts in\nWorkbench](https://docs.stripe.com/workbench/keyboard-shortcuts)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Developers Dashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/development/dashboard)\n- [Developers](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/developers)\n- [related set of guides](https://docs.stripe.com/workbench/guides)\n- [need a Stripe account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register)\n- [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/)\n- [Workbench](https://dashboard.stripe.com/workbench)\n- [Overview](https://dashboard.stripe.com/workbench/overview)\n- [upgrade the default API\nversion](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#how-can-i-upgrade-my-api)\n- [Errors](https://dashboard.stripe.com/workbench/errors)\n- [Inspector](https://dashboard.stripe.com/workbench/inspector)\n- [sandbox](https://docs.stripe.com/sandboxes)\n- [Logs](https://dashboard.stripe.com/workbench/logs)\n- [Events](https://dashboard.stripe.com/workbench/events)\n- [managing webhook\nendpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/workbench/event-destinations)\n- [Webhooks](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)\n- [Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli)\n- [Shell](https://dashboard.stripe.com/workbench/shell)\n- [Shell and API Explorer](https://docs.stripe.com/workbench/shell)\n- [Stripe-Account\nheader](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/authentication#stripe-account-header)\n- [Keyboard shortcuts in\nWorkbench](https://docs.stripe.com/workbench/keyboard-shortcuts)",
