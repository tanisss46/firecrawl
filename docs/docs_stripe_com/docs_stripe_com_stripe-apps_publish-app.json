  "content": "# Publish your app to the Stripe App Marketplace\n\n## Make your app discoverable to any user by publishing it on the Stripe App Marketplace.\n\nTo share your app beyond your own team, publish it to the [Stripe App\nMarketplace](https://marketplace.stripe.com/). This makes it available for\ninstallation on any Stripe account, not just your own.\n\nPublication comes with some restrictions:\n\n- Your account must be\n[activated](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/activate).\n- You can only publish one app per account.\n- Currently to publish an app on the Stripe Marketplace, you can’t be a Platform\naccount.\n- Stripe can only support language listings at this time. To support\nadditional languages, reach out to Stripe.\n- Published apps must pass a review process. For more information, see the [app\nreview requirements](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/review-requirements)\nand [app listing\nguidelines](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/listing-guidelines).\n- If you need to remove your app from the Stripe App Marketplace later, you must\ncontact Stripe for removal.\n\nThese restrictions only apply to apps that you share with public users in the\nStripe App Marketplace. If your app only needs to be available to your own [team\nmembers](https://docs.stripe.com/dashboard/teams), learn to [upload and install\nyour app](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/upload-install-app) instead.\n\n## Before you begin\n\n- If you’ve already [installed your app in live\nmode](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/upload-install-app), you must\n[uninstall\nit](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/upload-install-app#uninstall-your-live-app)\nto switch to publishing your app.\n- Choose a Stripe account to associate with your app. You can only publish one\napp per account.\n- To understand the process for getting your app approved for listing, see [app\nreview requirements](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/review-requirements).\n[Update the distribution\ntype](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/publish-app#set-your-distribution-type)-\nSet your app to the public distribution.\n\n```\nstripe apps set distribution public\n```\n\nThis command updates the manifest file with a `distribution_type` field set to a\n`public` value.\n\n```\n{\n \"id\": \"com.example.app\",\n \"version\": \"1.2.3\",\n \"name\": \"Example App\",\n \"icon\": \"./example_icon_32.png\",\n \"distribution_type\": \"public\"\n}\n```\n\n[Add\npermissions](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/publish-app#add-permissions)\nTo add your app’s required permissions:\n\n- Determine which objects your app calls on the Stripe API. If you’re [migrating\nan extension to an app](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/migrate-extension),\nyou must determine which objects your extension (not your app) calls on the\nStripe API to understand which permissions to include.\n- See the [list of\npermissions](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/reference/permissions) you can\nadd to your [app\nmanifest](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/reference/app-manifest).\n- You can add a permission to the `permissions` array in your `stripe-app.json`\napp manifest file using the following command:\n\n```\nstripe apps grant permission \"PERMISSION_NAME\" \"EXPLANATION\"\n```\n\nPopulate the prompts with your permission’s information:\n\n- `PERMISSION_NAME`: The name of the permission you’d like to add. See [possible\npermission names](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/reference/permissions).\n- `EXPLANATION`: Explanation for enabling access. Users see this explanation\nwhen they install your app.\n\nRepeat this step for each new permission that you want to add to your\napplication.\n\n### Your app manifest file should look like this:\n\nTo remove a permission, you can also use the CLI:\n\n```\nstripe apps revoke permission \"PERMISSION_NAME\"\n```\n\n[Upload in test\nmode](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/publish-app#upload-in-test-mode)\nTo upload your app, run the following command from your project root directory:\n\n```\nstripe apps upload\n```\n\nStripe validates your app manifest, then uploads and installs your app to your\nStripe test account.\n\nAfter this step:\n\n- Any team member can access your app in [test\nmode](https://docs.stripe.com/test-mode) at\n[https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/).\n- Your app can [store\nsecrets](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/store-secrets) in test mode.\n- You can access your app’s signing secret to connect it to a\n[backend](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/build-backend).\n[Submit app for\nreview](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/publish-app#submit-app-for-review)-\nUpload a new version of your app after [setting the distribution\ntype](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/publish-app#set-your-distribution-type).\n\nAfter you make your distribution choice, Stripe automatically applies it to all\nfuture app versions.

From the Stripe App\nMarketplace, users are redirected to this URL to install your app.\n#### Note\n\nThe URL must link to a page that can initiate the onboarding and installation\nprocess with clear instructions.\n- **Testing credentials**: If your app requires sign in, provide at least one\ntest account to allow Stripe to test and review your app. See the [example\ntesting\ncredentials](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/review-requirements#test-plan-and-credentials).\n#### Caution\n\nStripe **does not** permit you to use real (non-test) accounts for the app\nreview process.\n- **Testing guidance**: Provide user scenarios to allow Stripe to simulate the\nuser’s intended installation and usage of your app. To increase your chances of\npassing app review, see [example testing\nguidance](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/review-requirements#test-plan-and-credentials).\n- **Contact emails**: Provide the email of the recipient for app review updates,\nand the email of a contact for resolving security incidents.\n\nAny changes you make after starting the review process are subject to an\nadditional review period.
