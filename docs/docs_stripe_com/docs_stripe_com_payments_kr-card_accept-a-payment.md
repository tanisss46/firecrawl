# Accept a payment using local cards in South Korea

## Enable your users to pay using locally issued cards from South Korea.

Stripe-hosted pageDirect API
#### Caution

Stripe automatically presents your customers payment method options by
evaluating their currency, payment method restrictions, and other parameters. We
recommend that you configure your payment methods from the Stripe Dashboard
using the instructions in [Accept a
payment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web&ui=stripe-hosted).

If you want to continue manually configuring the payment methods you present to
your customers with Checkout, use this guide. Otherwise, update your integration
to [configure payment methods in the
Dashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/dashboard-payment-methods).

Integrating with South Korean cards lets South Korea-based customers pay using
all local issuer-branded cards issued by South Korean card issuers.

When a customer makes a payment, theyâ€™re redirected to the checkout page of our
local processor partner to authenticate and authorize the payment. After the
customer authorizes the payment, Stripe redirects them back to your site.

[A Checkout
Session](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/how-checkout-works) must
satisfy all of the following conditions to support South Korean payment methods:

- [Prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices) for all line items must be
expressed in Korean won (currency code `krw`).
- The minimum amount accepted is 100 KRW.

payment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/kr-card/accept-a-payment#accept-a-kr-card-payment)
Enable South Korean cards by making the following updates to your integration.

When creating a [Checkout
Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions), you must do the
following:

- Add `kr_card` to the list of `payment_method_types`.
- Make sure all `line_items` use the `krw` currency.

```
Stripe::Checkout::Session.create({
 mode: 'payment',
 payment_method_types: ['card'],
 payment_method_types: ['card', 'kr_card'],
 line_items: [{
 price_data: {
 currency: 'usd',
 # To accept `kr_card`, all line items must have currency: krw
 currency: 'krw',
 product_data: {
 name: 'T-shirt',
 },
 unit_amount: 2000,
 },
 quantity: 1,
 }],
 success_url: 'https://example.com/success',
 cancel_url: 'https://example.com/cancel',
})
```

[Test your
integration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/kr-card/accept-a-payment#test-integration)
While testing your Checkout integration, select **Local cards** and click
**Pay**. This redirects you to a Stripe-hosted page where you have the choice to
authorize or fail the payment. If you authorize the payment, the PaymentIntent
switches from `requires_action` to `succeeded`. Failing the test payment makes
the PaymentIntent switch from `requires_action` to `requires_payment_method`.
