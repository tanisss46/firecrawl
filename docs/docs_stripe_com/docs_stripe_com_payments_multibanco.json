If your business is\nbased in Europe or the United States, you can accept Multibanco payments from\ncustomers in Portugal using the [Payment Intents\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents).\n\nTo complete a transaction, customers receive a voucher that includes Multibanco\nentity and reference numbers. Customers use these voucher details to make a\npayment outside your checkout flow through online banking or from an ATM.\n\nPayment confirmation might be delayed by several days due to the initiation of a\nbank transfer when a customer pays for a Multibanco voucher. Bank transfers can\nencounter delays, particularly over weekends, contributing to the delay in\npayment confirmation.\n\nPayment method propertiesBusiness locationsProduct support- **Customer\nlocations**\n\nPortugal\n- **Presentment currency**\n\nEUR\n- **Payment confirmation**\n\nCustomer-initiated\n- **Payment method family**\n\nVoucher\n- **Recurring payments**\n\n[Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/multibanco#billing)\n- **Payout timing**\n\n[Standard payout timing](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts#payout-speed) applies\n- **Refunds / partial refunds**\n\n[Yes / Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/multibanco#refunds)\n- **Connect support**\n\n[Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/multibanco#connect)\n- **Dispute support**\n\n[No](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/multibanco#disputes)\n- **Manual capture support**\n\nNo\n- **Minimum charge amount**\n\n0.50 EUR\n- **Maximum charge amount**\n\n99,999 EUR\n\n## Payment flows\n\n### Online banking flow\n\n!\n\nSelects Multibanco at checkout\n\n!\n\nReceives voucher details (incl. entity, reference, and amount)\n\n!\n\nLogs into online banking\n\n!\n\nUses voucher details to complete the payment with online banking\n\n!\n\nReceives confirmation of funds sent\n\n### ATM flow\n\n!\n\nSelects Multibanco at checkout\n\n!\n\nReceives voucher details (incl. entity, reference, and amount)\n\n!\n\nUses voucher details to complete the payment at an ATM\n\n!\n\nReceives confirmation of funds sent\n\n## Get started\n\nYou don’t have to integrate Multibanco and other payment methods individually.\nIf you use our front-end products, Stripe automatically determines the most\nrelevant payment methods to display. Go to the [Stripe\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and enable\nMultibanco. To get started with one of our hosted UIs, follow a quickstart:\n\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart): Our prebuilt, hosted\ncheckout page.\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart): Our drop-in UI\ncomponents.\n\n### Other payment products\n\nThe following Stripe products also let you add Multibanco from the Dashboard:\n\n- [Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/no-code-guide)\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n- [Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview)\n\nIf you prefer to manually list payment methods, learn how to [manually configure\nMultibanco as a payment\nmethod](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/multibanco/accept-a-payment).\n\n## Disputes\n\nThe risk of fraud or unrecognized payments is low with Multibanco because the\ncustomer must push funds from their bank account. As a result, there’s no\ndispute process that can result in a chargeback and funds withdrawn from your\nStripe account.\n\n## Refunds\n\nYou can refund Multibanco payments in the\n[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments) or using the [Refunds\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api/refunds).\n\nThe refund period for Multibanco is up to 365 days after the original payment.\nFull and partial refunds are supported. Customers typically receive refunds in\ntheir bank accounts within 1 day. However, this time frame varies by bank.\n\nIf a Multibanco [Refund](https://docs.stripe.com/api/refunds/object) object’s\n`status` transitions to `succeeded`, the\n[destination_details.multibanco.reference](https://docs.stripe.com/api/refunds/object#refund_object-destination_details-multibanco-reference)\nproperty contains a refund identifier that you can provide the customer.\n\n## Billing\n\nUse [Stripe Billing](https://stripe.com/billing) to create Multibanco supported\n[invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices) and\n[subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating).\nMultibanco invoices and subscriptions only support the `send_invoice`\n[collection\nmethod](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-collection_method).\n\n## Connect\n\nYou can use [Stripe Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/how-connect-works)\nwith Multibanco to process payments on behalf of a connected account. Connect\nusers can use Multibanco with the following charge types:\n\n- [Direct](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges)\n- [Destination](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges)\n- [Separate charges and\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n### Enable Multibanco for connected accounts that use the Stripe Dashboard\n\nConnected accounts that use the Stripe Dashboard can enable Multibanco in their\n[Payment methods\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) in the\nDashboard.\n\n### Enable Multibanco for connected accounts that use the Express Dashboard or a dashboard that isn’t hosted by Stripe\n\nRequest the `multibanco_payments` capability on any connected account you want\nto enable Multibanco for. Follow the instructions to [enable payment methods for\nyour connected accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities).\n\n## Links\n\n- [Payment Intents API](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents)\n- [pricing details](https://stripe.com/pricing/local-payment-methods)\n- [Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/multibanco#billing)\n- [Standard payout timing](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts#payout-speed)\n- [Yes / Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/multibanco#refunds)\n- [Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/multibanco#connect)\n- [No](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/multibanco#disputes)\n- [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods)\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart)\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart)\n- [Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/no-code-guide)\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n- [Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview)\n- [manually configure Multibanco as a payment\nmethod](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/multibanco/accept-a-payment)\n- [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments)\n- [Refunds API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/refunds)\n- [Refund](https://docs.stripe.com/api/refunds/object)\n-\n[destination_details.multibanco.reference](https://docs.stripe.com/api/refunds/object#refund_object-destination_details-multibanco-reference)\n- [Stripe Billing](https://stripe.com/billing)\n- [invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n- [subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating)\n- [collection\nmethod](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-collection_method)\n- [Stripe Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/how-connect-works)\n- [Direct](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges)\n- [Destination](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges)\n- [Separate charges and\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n- [enable payment methods for your connected\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities)",
