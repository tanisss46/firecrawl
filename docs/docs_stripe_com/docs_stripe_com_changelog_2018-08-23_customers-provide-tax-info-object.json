  "content": "# Customers now provide a tax_info object with their tax ID detailsBreaking changes\n\n## What’s new\n\nIn both requests and responses, changes the\n[Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers) object `business_vat_id`\nattribute from a string to hash called `tax_info`, consisting of `tax_id` and\n`type`.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis change restructures the customer’s VAT information from a simple string to\na more detailed hash structure.
