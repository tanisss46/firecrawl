To use Alipay on Stripe, your business can’t be\n[restricted from using Stripe](https://stripe.com/restricted-businesses) or\nappear on Alipay’s [prohibited business list](https://stripe.com/legal/alipay).\nIf you’re not sure if your business is a prohibited business, or have questions\nabout how these requirements apply to you, please [contact\nsupport](https://support.stripe.com/contact/login).\n\nFor more information about Alipay eligibility for your account, navigate to your\n[Payment methods\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods).\n\n## Get started\n\nYou don’t have to integrate Alipay and other payment methods individually. If\nyou use our front-end products, Stripe automatically determines the most\nrelevant payment methods to display. Go to the [Stripe\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and enable\nAlipay. To get started with one of our hosted UIs, follow a quickstart:\n\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart): Our prebuilt, hosted\ncheckout page.\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart): Our drop-in UI\ncomponents.\n\n[Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links) also supports adding\nAlipay from the Dashboard.\n\nIf you prefer to manually list payment methods, learn how to [manually configure\nAlipay as a payment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/alipay/accept-a-payment).\n\n## Disputes\n\nAlipay payments have a low risk of fraud or unrecognized payments because the\ncustomer must authenticate the payment, so no dispute process exists that could\ncreate chargebacks and withdraw funds from your Stripe account. If an Alipay\nuser contacts them about a problem with a transaction, they might direct that\nuser to you for a resolution.\n\n## Refunds\n\nYou can refund Alipay payments up to 90 days after the original payment. Refunds\nfor Alipay payments are asynchronous and take up to 5 minutes to complete.\nStripe notifies you of the final refund status using the `refund.updated` or\n`refund.failed` [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) event. When a refund\nsucceeds, the status of the [Refund](https://docs.stripe.com/api/refunds/object)\nobject transitions to `succeeded`. If a refund fails, the status of the Refund\nobject transitions to `failed` and Stripe returns the amount to your Stripe\nbalance. You then need to arrange an alternative way of providing your customer\nwith a refund.\n\n## Supported currencies\n\nYou can create Alipay payments in the currencies that map to your country. The\ndefault local currency for Alipay is `cny` and customers also see their purchase\namount in `cny`.\n\nCurrencyCountry`cny`Any country`aud`Australia`cad`Canada`eur`Austria, Belgium,\nBulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany,\nGreece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands,\nNorway, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden,\nSwitzerland`gbp`United Kingdom`hkd`Hong Kong`jpy`Japan`myr`Malaysia`nzd`New\nZealand`sgd`Singapore`usd`United States\nIf you have a bank account in another currency and would like to create an\nAlipay payment in that currency, you can [contact\nsupport](https://support.stripe.com/email). Support for additional currencies is\nprovided on a case-by-case basis.\n\n## Connect\n\nAlipay has partial [Connect](https://stripe.com/connect) support depending on\nthe [charge type](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges).\n\nDestination chargesSeparate charges and transfersDirect charges`on_behalf_of`\nFor connected accounts with standard Dashboard access, individual connected\naccounts can enable Alipay in the Dashboard.\n\nFor connected accounts without standard Dashboard access, the platform needs to\nrequest the `alipay_payments` capability.
