They apply to\nboth the platform and its connected accounts. Offer your Treasury-based\nfinancial services only to businesses that meet the requirements.\n\n## Fraud management process\n\nStripe requires that Treasury platforms maintain a fraud risk management\nprocess. The process must include proactive measures to prevent and monitor\nunauthorized or fraudulent activity, and take steps to remediate it. This\nincludes:\n\n- Establishing processes to identify and understand the business of your\ncustomers.\n- Implementing robust tools to prevent unauthorized access to customer accounts.\n- Educating Connected Accounts on how fraud can occur, and establishing a robust\nprocess for alerting Connected Accounts when suspected fraud occurs.\n- Conducting root cause analyses after fraud incidents occur to identify\nopportunities to improve controls.\n\nSee the [Treasury Fraud\nguide](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/examples/fraud-guide) for best practices\non implementing and maintaining a fraud risk management program.\n\n## Supported countries\n\nStripe Treasury is available only to platforms and connected accounts located in\nthe United States. To be considered a US business, you must be able to\ndemonstrate:\n\n- Your business physically operates from an address within the United States and\nthat address can’t be a PO box, highway contract box, or private mailbox.\n- Your business has at least one account representative that lives at an address\nwithin the United States. That address can’t be a PO box, highway contract box,\nor private mailbox.\n\nBusiness owners that reside in certain countries outside of the US are\npermissible, but might require enhanced review. Additionally, you can’t use the\nFinancial Account to send or receive funds to or from sources outside the United\nStates. Stripe prohibits using Treasury for any dealings, engagement, or sale of\ngoods or services linked directly or indirectly with jurisdictions Stripe has\ndeemed high risk, such as Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, and the Crimea,\nDonetsk, and Luhansk regions.\n\n## Business use cases only\n\nStripe Treasury is available only to platforms with B2B use cases. Stripe\ndoesn’t offer financial accounts to consumers or provide Treasury features for\nconsumer purposes.\n\n## Connected account types\n\nTreasury only supports connected accounts that don’t use a Stripe-hosted\ndashboard and where your platform is responsible for requirements collection and\nloss liability, including Custom connected accounts. Learn how to [create\nconnected\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/design-an-integration?connect-onboarding-surface=api&connect-dashboard-type=none&connect-economic-model=buy-rate&connect-loss-liability-owner=platform&connect-charge-type=direct)\nthat work with Treasury.\n\n#### Private preview\n\nEnabling Treasury on non-custom connected accounts is a new feature. Email\n[treasury-support@stripe.com](mailto:treasury-support@stripe.com) to request\naccess.\n\nAs a platform with connected accounts, you’re responsible for maintaining a\nminimum API version, communicating terms of service updates to your connected\naccounts, handling information requests from them, and providing them with\nsupport. Because your platform is ultimately responsible for the losses your\nconnected accounts incur, you’re also responsible for vetting them for fraud. To\nlearn more, read the [Treasury fraud\nguide](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/examples/fraud-guide).\n\n## Supported countries of residence\n\nStripe Treasury currently supports businesses in the US only, but the business\nowners and authorized persons of those businesses can reside in over 150\ncountries. Some countries of residence, however, can require a more detailed\nreview before you can onboard them to your platform.\n\nStripe prohibits using Treasury for any dealings, engagement, or sale of goods\nor services linked directly or indirectly with jurisdictions Stripe has deemed\nhigh risk, such as Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, and the Crimea, Donetsk, and\nLuhansk regions.\n\n## Prohibited and restricted business types\n\nThe businesses and business practices in the following categories are either\nrestricted or prohibited from using Stripe Treasury.
