# Onboarding overview

## Take your integration live.

Use this guide to develop and launch an integration using Stripe
[Issuing](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing) (in the US, EU, or UK) or
[Treasury](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury) (US only). To successfully go live,
your offering must be a business we support, and you must integrate systems and
establish business processes.

Before you go live, you must:

- **Get your use case approved:** Submit information pertaining to your use
case, familiarize yourself with the compliance requirements, and explore test
mode.
- **Obtain live mode access:** Build in the production environment, manage the
necessary operational responsibilities, and complete the required compliance
tasks.
- **Get ready to launch your BaaS offering:** Test the program out with your
employees using real funds.

benefits providers.

## Milestone 1: Get your use case approved

Start by submitting an [intake form](https://stripe.com/contact/sales) that
includes a high-level overview of what you’re looking to use Stripe Issuing and
Treasury for. If you’re a funded business with a dedicated team of developers,
or simply working with a single developer, include those details in the form.

After you submit the form, our team will reach out within 5 days to let you know
if your use case is a good fit. We also let you know if we think your desired
product or products don’t [serve your use
case](https://support.stripe.com/questions/supported-business-use-cases-for-stripe-issuing)
well. During the call, an assigned Stripe account representative asks you more
about your use case and motivation as part of our supportability assessment. We
also advise you on best practices and how to build a [compelling financial
services offering](https://stripe.com/guides/building-a-fintech-company).

Following the call, we’ll inform you whether we can support your business within
5 business days (certain use cases can take longer). While you wait, you can
build a [test mode](https://docs.stripe.com/test-mode) integration to explore
the product’s capabilities, and familiarize yourself with our compliance
requirements. If we deem your use case supportable, your account representative
provides you with any necessary agreements, and once signed, configures your
program.

## Milestone 2: Obtain live mode access

To obtain live mode access, you must complete the required compliance tasks. In
parallel, we recommend you build your integration in a production environment
and operationalize required processes.

### Build your integration

At any time, you can explore an integration in test mode using our [sample
app](https://docs.stripe.com/baas/start-integration/sample-app). After you sign
the legal agreement, Stripe configures your program to the capabilities required
for your business model. After you receive approval, you can begin submitting
live mode transactions.

### Manage operational responsibilities

Prior to go-live, you need to take care of various operational responsibilities:

- **Customer support:** Understand what types of customer inquiries you need to
handle and [equip your support
team](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/customer-support) with the appropriate
information and tools.
- **Compliance management:** Set up the necessary compliance processes outlined
in the [compliance
section](https://docs.stripe.com/baas/start-integration/onboarding-overview#complete-compliance-tasks).
- **Physical cards:** If your use case requires [physical
cards](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/cards/physical), you can order [standard
cards](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/cards/physical) if you want to go to
market quickly. Or you can [fully
customize](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/cards/physical/order-custom-bundle)
your cards with unique artwork and materials, if physical cards are a core part
of your business.
- **Mobile wallets:** If your use case necessitates Apple Pay, [review the
steps](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/cards/digital-wallets) required for
approval.

### Complete compliance tasks

You need to complete a set of compliance tasks before you can launch your
integration. Stripe must also review and approve your fees, terms of service,
marketing material, and user interfaces. To help in this process, we provide a
workflow tool to manage compliance submissions and feedback as well as to help
you stay organized.

- **Implement all requirements for a public launch**

You must submit screenshots of your marketing, onboarding, and account servicing
flows using the [compliance intake
form](https://form.asana.com/?k=8K51UWmWhttehNFD5qBLdg&d=974470123217835) to
demonstrate compliance. Before you build user-facing marketing, onboarding, and
account servicing pages, review the following content guidelines:

- [Unfair and Deceptive Acts or Practices
(UDAP):](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/compliance#udap-and-correct-messaging)
Keep your advertising clear and honest.
- [Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography And Marketing
(CAN-SPAM):](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/compliance#can-spam) Comply with
commercial email messaging.
- [Messaging and
marketing:](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/compliance#issuing-messaging-guidelines)
Use the right terms to accurately reflect the account structure and benefits,
including [Treasury-specific
messaging](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/marketing-treasury).
- [Prohibition on international
marketing:](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/compliance#prohibition-on-international-marketing)
Limit to US-based merchants.
- Required agreements and disclosures for
[Treasury](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/compliance#treasury-terms),
[Issuing](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/compliance#issuing-terms), and [other
features](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/compliance#fees-credits-rewards-terms):
Appropriately disclose fees and required identifying information.

Stripe requires that you submit screenshots to demonstrate the following:

- You include all required agreements and disclosures in your onboarding flow,
and make them available outside of onboarding.
- Customers have a channel to [submit
complaints](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/handling-complaints) to you and to
[initiate transaction
disputes](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/purchases/disputes).
- [Regulatory
emails](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/compliance-us/issuing-regulated-customer-notices)
are sent when required for Issuing accounts.
- [Regulatory
receipts](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/regulatory-receipts) are
provided when required for Treasury transactions.
- If you choose to provide [account
statements](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/compliance#statements), you must
submit evidence they meet statement requirements.
- **Get approved to launch to the public**

After you submit your screenshots, Stripe reviews and approves within two weeks
or requests additional revisions. If there are any adjustments that need to be
made to your submissions, we let you know, so that you can resubmit with the
needed adjustments.

## Milestone 3: Get ready to launch your BaaS offering

Now you’re ready to request your first virtual or physical card. Using real
funds, test the program out by having designated employees complete initial
transactions.

### Operationalize ongoing activities to remain compliant

Once live, you need to dedicate resources to ongoing operational requirements:

- **Marketing reviews:** Learn how to [submit new marketing material or user
interfaces](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/compliance#going-live) for
approval.
- **Customer complaints:** Receive and resolve customer complaints, and [report
them to
Stripe](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/handling-complaints#complaints-tracking)
each month.
- **Dispute handling:** Set up [dispute
handling](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/purchases/disputes) processes for your
card program.
- **Lost or stolen cards:** Allow customers to report lost or stolen cards so
you can cancel them immediately and (optionally) [request
replacements](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/cards/replacements#replacements-for-lost-or-stolen-cards).
- **Recordkeeping:**
[Record](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/compliance#recordkeeping) all
marketing materials, customer data, and [regulatory
receipts](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/regulatory-receipts),
and disclosures you make for at least 5 years.
