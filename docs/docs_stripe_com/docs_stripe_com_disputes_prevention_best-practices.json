By employing some of these best\npractices as part of your overall strategy, you can avoid excessive chargebacks\nand reduce potential customer burden and losses.\n\n## Tools for everyone\n\nThese are tools that any Stripe user—whether or not they’re a developer, and\nwhether or not they use any specialized Stripe tools like\n[Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar)—can leverage to reduce fraud and dispute\nincidents.\n\n### Be clear and transparent with your customers\n\nClear and frequent contact with your customers can help prevent many of the\n[reasons](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/categories) for disputes. By\nresponding to issues and processing refunds or replacement orders quickly, your\ncustomers are far less likely to take the time to dispute a payment. Make your\ncustomer service contact information easy to find, keep customers updated\nthroughout their order process, and provide updates about deliveries.\n\n#### Caution\n\nInclude a clear description of your refund and cancellation policies in your\nterms of service. You can require your users to agree to your terms of service\nto increase the likelihood that card issuers respect your policies in the event\nof a dispute.\n\n- Require ToS Agreement\nIn general, make your terms of service and policies easy to find on your\nwebsite, and require customers to agree to them. Rather than only linking to\nthem during checkout, provide a full version of them on the checkout page or as\na pop-up with a requirement to agree to them prior to submitting the order.\n- Show complete policy\nCard issuers can be very specific about how you present your policies. If you\nhave a checkbox your customer must accept that only contains a link, the issuer\nmight reject it as unsatisfactory evidence that your customer was aware of your\npolicies. There must be reasonable evidence that you presented your customer\nwith a full copy of your policies prior to their purchase.\n- Track shipping\nWhen shipping physical goods to customers, use carriers and services that\nprovide online tracking and delivery confirmation whenever possible. Provide\nthis information to your customers as soon as it’s available (if you need to\nsubmit tracking information as dispute evidence, be aware that card issuers\ndon’t follow links so screenshots must be provided).\n- Use clear statement descriptors\nSet a recognizable name for your [statement\ndescriptor](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/activate#public-business-information)\nthrough your [account\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/account/?support_details=true).\nWe recommend using your website domain or business name to make sure customers\ncan easily identify their purchase when they look at their statement.\n\nStatement descriptors are limited to between 5 and 22 characters. They must\ncontain at least 5 letters and can’t use the special characters `<`, `>`, `\\`,\n`'`, or `\"`.\n- Separate your business accounts\nAvoid using the same Stripe account for separate businesses. Each Stripe account\nshould represent a single business, which allows for separate statement\ndescriptors and contact information. If you need to process payments for\nmultiple businesses, create [additional\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/multiple-accounts) for\neach.\n\n### Consider proactively refunding suspicious payments\n\nYou should immediately refund any payment you’re [sure is\nfraud](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/identifying-fraud) (unless\nyou’re covered by some form of liability shift, such as with [3D\nSecure](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure/authentication-flow#disputed-payments)).\nIf you know you’re going to receive a fraud dispute on it, you can save yourself\nthe [dispute\nfee](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/how-disputes-work#dispute-fees), the\nincrease to your [dispute\nrate](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/measuring#dispute-rate-usage), and the\npotential loss of product by fully refunding the fraudulent payment.\n\n#### Caution\n\nWhile customers can’t dispute fully refunded payments, they can still dispute\npartially refunded payments. Card network rules even allow for a payment that\nhas been partially refunded to be disputed for the full payment amount.\n\nHowever, sometimes you might suspect a payment is fraud, but your suspicions\nfall short of absolute certainty. Sometimes it makes sense to aggressively\nrefund every charge that falls into this gray area and sometimes it doesn’t.\n\nYou might want to pursue an aggressive refund strategy if any of the following\napply:\n\n- **Order not yet fulfilled**. The loss of your product could be prevented by a\nrefund. That is, if you haven’t already committed your product or service in\nsome irreversible way by the time you suspect fraud, you might want to be more\naggressive in refunding. Whereas if your product or service was\nirretrievable—for example, the product already shipped, or the service has\nalready been used—it might make more sense *not* to refund, and to wait and see\nif it does turn out to be fraud.\n- **Excessive disputes**. Your recent dispute activity has been\n[excessive](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/measuring#excessive-dispute-activity)\nby card network definitions, which could put your account standing with Stripe\nat risk or put you at risk of being identified into a chargeback monitoring\nprogram.\n- **Chargeback monitoring program**. You’re already in a [chargeback monitoring\nprogram](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/monitoring-programs) and need to exit\nthe program.\n- **New or small business**. Your business has small enough payment volume (say,\nfewer than 100 payments per month) that one or two fraud disputes can have a\nvery outsized impact on your [dispute\nrate](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/measuring#dispute-rate-usage), even if\nyou otherwise have little dispute activity.\n\nIf none of the above apply, you might want to be more conservative with how\nfrequently you proactively refund charges you suspect are fraudulent.\n\n#### Refunding a payment as fraud\n\nTo refund a payment, in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/), select\nthe payment and click **Refund as fraud**. This refunds the payment and reports\nit as fraudulent to Stripe so that we can further improve our fraud detection.\n\n### Delay shipping orders\n\nIf you ship physical goods, consider delaying the shipment by 24-48 hours. This\ntime gives cardholders a chance to spot and report any fraud on their accounts.\nYou would still receive a fraud dispute in this scenario, but at least you\nwouldn’t also lose the merchandise. Not all cardholders check their statements\non a daily basis, however, and their card issuer might not proactively notify\nthem about the transaction.\n\n[Customers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers) that request overnight or\nexpedited shipping should be considered higher risk, as the increased cost of\nsuch services is of no consequence to fraudsters. One tactic you can use to\nidentify these types of payments is to offer same day or overnight shipping at a\nvery high cost–many times more expensive than any other shipping option you\nprovide.\n\nIt’s far less likely that any legitimate customer would pay such a high cost,\nbut a fraudster would want the goods to be shipped as soon as possible and have\nno regard for the additional cost. You can then manually screen any customers\nthat opt for the anomalously expensive shipping option and scrutinize the order\nto determine if it looks genuine. Using a [separate auth and capture\nprocess](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/best-practices#use-auth-and-capture-when-creating-payments)\ntogether with [Radar\nreviews](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/best-practices#manually-review-payments)\nis a good way to do so.\n\n### Ship to a verified address\n\nShipping to a [verified billing\naddress](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/verification#avs-check)\nwhich has passed postal code and street address checks is the safest option.\nWhen using an address that hasn’t been verified, you can’t prove that the order\nwas shipped to the legitimate cardholder if the payment is later disputed.\n\nThis doesn’t prevent you shipping to a different address, though you should do\nall you can to mitigate the risks involved. For instance, you may only want to\nship orders to a different address for returning customers you already know to\nbe legitimate, or who provide a fully verifiable billing address. In addition,\nany of the following could indicate the payment is suspicious:\n\n- The order is much larger than normal, or is only for your most expensive\nproducts\n- The customer changed the shipping address after placing the order\n- The customer requested expedited shipping\n- The products ordered have a high resale value\n- The shipping destination is different from the billing address or the card’s\ncountry of origin (for example, the billing address is in Spain, but the\nshipping address is in France)\n\nReviewing the order and the shipping address information can help you determine\nwhether or not the order presents an unacceptable risk to you.\n\n### Benchmarking your dispute rate\n\nYour account’s [dispute\nrate](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/measuring#dispute-rate-usage) is an\nimportant metric to use when reviewing the efficacy of your disputes and fraud\nprevention methods. You can regularly review these metrics in your Stripe\nDashboard to see the impact your dispute prevention strategies are having.\n\n## Tools for users of Radar for Fraud Teams\n\n[Radar](https://stripe.com/radar) is a suite of features and tools for fighting\nfraud that is built into Stripe and requires no additional integration work.\n\n### Manually review payments\n\n[Radar for Fraud Teams](https://stripe.com/radar/fraud-teams) includes a\n[review](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews) feature that allows you to place\ncertain payments into review—though keep in mind that these payments are still\nprocessed and the credit card charged, unless you are using a separate auth and\ncapture process. These payments are placed into the [review\nqueue](https://dashboard.stripe.com/radar) for you to take a closer look at. If\nyou suspect the payment is fraudulent, you can refund it.\n\nYou should review payments that Stripe has placed into your [review\nqueue](https://dashboard.stripe.com/radar) as soon as possible. Payments with an\n[elevated risk](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/risk-evaluation#elevated-risk) of\nfraud are automatically marked for review. You can also create additional rules\nto customize the types of payments that should be placed in your review queue.\n\nHere are some considerations when reviewing a payment:\n\n- Does the billing address match the shipping address?\n- Has the billing address been verified by AVS? Does it also match the card’s\ncountry of origin?\n- Does the customer’s email address match the cardholder’s name?\n- Is this an order that the customer has asked to be expedited?\n- Have multiple orders from different credit cards originated from this same IP\naddress?\n- Has this customer made many order attempts that have been declined?\n\nIf you’re unsure about a payment when you’re reviewing it, you should always\ncontact the customer by phone or email. If a payment’s billing and shipping\naddress don’t match, look into the shipping address using [Google Maps & Street\nView](https://www.google.com/maps/streetview) to find out more. A common tactic\nthat fraudsters use is to have orders shipped to a freight or mail forwarding\nservice or storage facility that forwards the goods to their actual location.\n\n### Use Radar rules to automatically block payments or place them in review\n\n[Radar for Fraud Teams](https://stripe.com/radar/fraud-teams), is built directly\ninto the payment flow and combines a customizable rules engine with powerful\nmachine learning algorithms. It can detect patterns across payments from every\nbusiness processing payments with Stripe, assessing the risk of each one.\n\nUsing [rules](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules), you can automatically\nevaluate payments based on your specific detection criteria and take the\nappropriate action on them. You can also create rules that use multiple\ncriteria, allowing you to allow or block payments that meet multiple conditions.\nEach business has different risks.\n\n### Country and card type limiting\n\nIf you’re experiencing increased fraud coming from certain countries, you can\nset up rules to block payments from any country you do not want to accept\npayments from, using the `:ip_country:` and `:card_country:` rule attributes.\nFor example, you can create the following rule to block all payments and cards\noriginating from Canada: `Block if :ip_country: = ca and :card_country: = 'ca'`.\nSimilarly, if your business only supports the country it operates in, you can\ncreate a rule that blocks any payments from all other countries. For example, a\nrule to block payments that don’t originate from Australia is: `Block if\n:ip_country: != au and :card_country: != 'au'`.\n\nYou can set limits on which type of cards to accept, either by brand, (for\nexample, Mastercard), or by funding type (for example, pre-paid). This can be\nparticularly helpful if you see excessive fraud from certain card types. To\nblock payments from all Visa-issued debit cards, an example rule would be:\n`Block if :card_brand: = visa and :card_funding: = 'debit'`.\n\n## Tools for developers\n\nThese are tools that require some development work to implement. If you rely on\na [Stripe partner](https://stripe.com/partners) to provide your payments\nintegration, you might not have the ability to directly implement these on your\nown.\n\n### Process your transactions on Stripe\n\nThe [Visa Compelling Evidence\n3.0](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/categories#visa-ce-30) rules rely on\ntransaction history to dispute friendly fraud by showing previous non-fraud\ntransactions with the same cardholder within a specified period. When you get a\nVisa fraud dispute, Stripe can identify qualifying transactions in your history\non our platform and pre-populate the dispute response with most of the required\nevidence you need. You can use this evidence to significantly increase your\nlikelihood of overturning the dispute in your favor.\n\nStripe can’t determine eligibility or submit evidence for externally processed\ntransactions, so we recommend:\n\n- Using Stripe processing whenever possible\n- Including the customer IP address, email address, shipping address, and\nproduct descriptions in your transactions with Stripe\n\n### Collect as much payment information as possible\n\nSome disputes are lost because only the minimum information was required during\ncheckout. This makes it difficult (sometimes impossible) for Stripe or the card\nissuer to verify that the customer is legitimate. For instance, while a billing\npostal code isn’t always necessary to process a card payment, including it\nallows the payment to be verified by the card issuer. If verification fails,\nconsider rejecting the payment because this might indicate fraud.\n\nUse [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout) or [Advanced fraud\ndetection](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/advanced-fraud-detection)\nto make sure your integration is best equipped to provide relevant payment\ninformation, such as:\n\n- [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers) name\n- Customer email address\n- CVC number\n- Full billing address and postal code\n- Shipping address (if different from billing address)\n- Tracking information\n\n### Implement a cardholder authentication method such as 3D Secure\n\n[3D Secure](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure) is a way to add a\nverification step between the customer and the card issuer to your checkout\nflow. Payments that have been authenticated with 3D Secure might be protected\nfrom most fraudulent disputes through a rule known as [liability\nshift](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure/authentication-flow#disputed-payments).\nYou will, however, still receive [Early Fraud\nWarnings](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/how-disputes-work#early-fraud-warnings)\nthat can count against [card brand monitoring\nprograms](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/monitoring-programs).\n\nLearn more at [Card Authentication and 3D\nSecure](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure).\n\n### Programmatically verify your customer’s identity\n\nFor some, verifying the identity of customers can be beneficial. Consider using\n[Stripe Identity](https://docs.stripe.com/identity) to verify a government ID\nand match with a selfie of the document holder. Alternatively, you can ask\ncustomers to connect their\n[Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/overview/) or\n[LinkedIn](https://developer.linkedin.com/docs/oauth2) accounts as a further\nproof of identity. This is an extra step that a fraudulent actor might not take.\nSome legitimate customers might not want to go through this additional step\neither, and your conversion rate might suffer as a result.\n\n### Use auth and capture when creating payments\n\nCredit card charge attempts are processed in two parts. The charge is first\n*authorized* by requesting authorization for the amount to charge from the card\nissuer. After a charge is approved, by default it’s then *captured* immediately\nafterwards and the amount deducted from the card.\n\nA [capture\nlater](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/place-a-hold-on-a-payment-method)\npayment flow (sometimes called “auth and capture”) is the process of performing\nthese two steps at separate times. The authorization can be made first, which\nholds the amount on the card and appears on a customer’s statement as a pending\ntransaction, but does not actually move money out of their account. The charge\ncan then be captured any time up to 7 days after the authorization. Capturing a\ncharge completes the payment and the funds are deducted from the customer’s\ncard. If a charge isn’t captured within the time limit, the authorization is\nautomatically released.\n\nSimilar to delayed shipping, this method can allow enough time for potential\nfraud to come to light, giving you the option to carefully review—and\npotentially refund—the transaction. Cardholders cannot dispute uncaptured\nauthorizations, only fully captured payments. With Radar for Fraud Teams you can\nmanually capture these payments in the [review\nprocess](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/best-practices#manually-review-payments).\n\n### Set a custom statement descriptor for each payment\n\nThe statement descriptor is the text that appears on customers’ card statements\nwith information about the company that’s associated with a payment. One way to\nuse a statement descriptor is to insert a short, random code that your customer\nthen has to verify. When you suspect a transaction might be fraudulent, you can\ncontact your customer and ask them to give you the code that is shown on their\nonline statement, and if they do not, you would refund the payment.\n\nYou can either edit your [default statement\ndescriptor](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public) within the Dashboard\nor set a [dynamic statement\ndescriptor](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/statement-descriptors#dynamic)\nwhenever a payment is created through the API.\n\nWhile this method can’t help against a fraudster who may have access to a\ncardholder’s online card issuer or credit account, this is rare. Using the\nstatement descriptor in this manner can provide reassurance that the customer is\nlikely to be genuine. As with some other prevention methods, the added customer\nfriction of this method could lead to some legitimate payments being refunded.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar)\n- [reasons](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/categories)\n- [statement\ndescriptor](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/activate#public-business-information)\n- [account\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/account/?support_details=true)\n- [additional\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/multiple-accounts)\n- [sure is fraud](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/identifying-fraud)\n- [3D\nSecure](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure/authentication-flow#disputed-payments)\n- [dispute fee](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/how-disputes-work#dispute-fees)\n- [dispute rate](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/measuring#dispute-rate-usage)\n-\n[excessive](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/measuring#excessive-dispute-activity)\n- [chargeback monitoring\nprogram](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/monitoring-programs)\n- [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/)\n- [Customers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers)\n- [verified billing\naddress](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/verification#avs-check)\n- [Radar](https://stripe.com/radar)\n- [Radar for Fraud Teams](https://stripe.com/radar/fraud-teams)\n- [review](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews)\n- [review queue](https://dashboard.stripe.com/radar)\n- [elevated risk](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/risk-evaluation#elevated-risk)\n- [Google Maps & Street View](https://www.google.com/maps/streetview)\n- [rules](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules)\n- [Stripe partner](https://stripe.com/partners)\n- [Visa Compelling Evidence\n3.0](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/categories#visa-ce-30)\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout)\n- [Advanced fraud\ndetection](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/advanced-fraud-detection)\n- [3D Secure](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure)\n- [Early Fraud\nWarnings](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/how-disputes-work#early-fraud-warnings)\n- [Stripe Identity](https://docs.stripe.com/identity)\n- [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/overview/)\n- [LinkedIn](https://developer.linkedin.com/docs/oauth2)\n- [capture\nlater](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/place-a-hold-on-a-payment-method)\n- [default statement descriptor](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public)\n- [dynamic statement\ndescriptor](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/statement-descriptors#dynamic)",
