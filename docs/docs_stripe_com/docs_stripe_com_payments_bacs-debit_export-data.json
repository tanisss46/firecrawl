We work with other payment processors and\nBacs sponsor banks throughout the migration to securely migrate your Bacs data.\nA Bacs migration takes at least 6 weeks to complete.\n\nTo import Bacs data from another payment processor to Stripe, see [Import Bacs\ndata from Stripe](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bacs-debit/import-data).\n\n[Submit your Bacs export migration\nrequest](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bacs-debit/export-data#submit-bacs-request)\nStart the migration process by submitting a data migration request.\n\n- Navigate to the [Stripe Support form for data\nmigrations](https://support.stripe.com/contact/email?topic=migrations). If\nyouâ€™re not signed in, select **Sign in** and enter the credentials of the\naccount that you want to migrate your data from.\n- Select **Export data out of Stripe to a third party**.\n- Select **Bacs** as the data type you want to export.\n- Complete the remaining fields and select **Send email**.\n\nOur data migrations team emails you within 3 business days of receiving your\nrequest.\n\n[Print, sign, and send your Bulk Change\nDeed](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bacs-debit/export-data#sign-bulk-change-deed)\nYour new Bacs provider must print and sign a bulk change deed. This agreement\nauthorizes the transfer of your mandates from Stripe to your new payment\nprocessor.\n\n#### Caution\n\n[Sign\nin](https://dashboard.stripe.com/login?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.stripe.com%2Fpayments%2Fbacs-debit%2Fexport-data)\nto download the bulk change deed.\n\n[Determine your switch\ndate](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bacs-debit/export-data#determine-switch-date)\nAfter we receive your bulk change deed, our Data Migrations team works with you,\nyour new payment processor, and their sponsor bank to agree on a switch date.\n\n[Wait for your data\nexport](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bacs-debit/export-data#wait-for-export)\nOur Data Migrations team exports your data and cancels your existing Bacs\nmandates on the agreed-upon date. This step is irreversible and removes the\nability to create charges on these mandates through Stripe.\n\nWe control the timing of the export of data from Stripe. There are other tasks\nthat your new processor and their sponsor bank must complete when importing the\ndata.\n\nSee [Bacs Direct Debit payments in the\nUK](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/bacs-debit) for more\ninformation.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Import Bacs data from\nStripe](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bacs-debit/import-data)\n- [Stripe Support form for data\nmigrations](https://support.stripe.com/contact/email?topic=migrations)\n- [Sign\nin](https://dashboard.stripe.com/login?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.stripe.com%2Fpayments%2Fbacs-debit%2Fexport-data)\n- [Bacs Direct Debit payments in the\nUK](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/bacs-debit)",
