In test mode,\nyou can simulate all of Stripe’s features without moving real money. To accept\nreal payments, you need to first activate your account and then use live mode.\nIf you haven’t [created your Stripe\naccount](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register) yet, complete that process\nbefore continuing.\n\n## Activate your account\n\nTo activate your account, fill out the [account\napplication](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/onboarding) requesting some\nbasic information about your business, product, and your personal relationship\nto your business. After activating your account, you can immediately start\naccepting live payments.\n\nStripe’s “Know Your Customer” (KYC) obligations require that we collect and\nmaintain this information on all Stripe users. These requirements come from our\nregulators and financial partners, and are intended to prevent abuse of the\nfinancial system. We review the information you provide internally to make sure\nthat it complies with [our services agreement](https://stripe.com/legal). We’ll\ncontact you if we need any further information.\n\nAfter you activate your Stripe account, you can’t change its country. If you\nneed to use Stripe in a different country that we support, you must create a new\naccount.\n\n#### Caution\n\nWe take privacy and security very seriously. Our [privacy\npolicy](https://stripe.com/privacy) explains how and for what purposes we\ncollect, use, retain, disclose, and safeguard any personal data you provide to\nus.\n\n## Public business information\n\nYour customers see the following details on either their card statements or in\n[email receipts](https://docs.stripe.com/receipts) sent by Stripe.\n\n- Business name and website URL\n- Business email address, phone number, and address\n- Support site URL\n- Statement descriptor text\n\nYou provide this information when you activate your account, and can update it\nany time in your [Account\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public). Make sure that your\nstatement descriptor text and business information are clearly associated with\nyou. If your customer can’t recognize one of your payments, they might\n[dispute](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes) it.\n\nStatement descriptors are limited to between 5 and 22 characters. They must\ncontain at least 5 letters and can’t use the special characters `<`, `>`, `\\`,\n`'`, `\"`, or `*`.\n\nYou can also use dynamic statement descriptors when creating a charge so that\neach payment has a custom statement descriptor. This dynamic text is appended to\nthe [shortened descriptor](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public) set in\nthe Stripe Dashboard. Statement descriptor prefixes are limited to between 2 and\n10 characters. For detailed information, see the documentation on [statement\ndescriptors](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/statement-descriptors).\n\n## Keep your account safe\n\nAfter you set up your account, you’ll want to keep it safe. Here are our\nrecommendations:\n\n- **Keep private information private**: Don’t share your password and keep your\nsecret [API keys](https://docs.stripe.com/keys) confidential on your own\nservers. As a reminder, Stripe employees will never ask you for your keys.\n- **Don’t reuse your Stripe password**: Use a password that’s unique to Stripe.\nIf you use your password on another site and that site is compromised, an\nattacker could use those stolen credentials to take over your account.\n- **Use team members to provide others with access to your account**: You can\n[invite others](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/teams) (with limited\naccess) to your Stripe account so that they can log in and take certain actions.\n- **Update your computer and browser regularly**: We recommend configuring your\ncomputer to automatically download and install updates (for example,\n[macOS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201541) or\n[Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/306525)). This helps protect\nyour system against automated attacks and malware.\n- **Beware of phishing**: All [genuine Stripe\nsites](https://support.stripe.com/questions/verify-you-are-on-an-official-stripe-webpage)\nuse the `stripe.com` domain and HTTPS. If you get an email from us that you\ndon’t expect, go directly to our site to log in. Don’t enter your password after\nclicking a link in an email. If you’re ever not sure it’s really us, review\n[Verified Stripe\ndomains](https://support.stripe.com/questions/verified-stripe-domains) on Stripe\nSupport.\n- **Enable two-factor verification**: When you enable two-factor authentication,\nyou’ll need to provide an additional unique code from your mobile device to\ncomplete the login process—either received as a text message or generated\nthrough an app like Google Authenticator. This means that even if someone steals\nyour username and password, they won’t be able to log in. To enable this\nfeature, go to your [user settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/user).\n\n## See also\n\n- [Account checklist](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/checklist)\n- [Multiple\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/multiple-accounts)\n\n## Links\n\n- [account checklist](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/checklist)\n- [test mode](https://docs.stripe.com/test-mode)\n- [created your Stripe account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register)\n- [account application](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/onboarding)\n- [our services agreement](https://stripe.com/legal)\n- [privacy policy](https://stripe.com/privacy)\n- [close your\naccount](https://support.stripe.com/questions/how-can-i-close-my-stripe-account)\n- [email receipts](https://docs.stripe.com/receipts)\n- [Account settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public)\n- [dispute](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes)\n- [statement\ndescriptors](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/statement-descriptors)\n- [API keys](https://docs.stripe.com/keys)\n- [invite others](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/teams)\n- [macOS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201541)\n- [Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/306525)\n- [genuine Stripe\nsites](https://support.stripe.com/questions/verify-you-are-on-an-official-stripe-webpage)\n- [Verified Stripe\ndomains](https://support.stripe.com/questions/verified-stripe-domains)\n- [user settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/user)\n- [Multiple\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/multiple-accounts)",
