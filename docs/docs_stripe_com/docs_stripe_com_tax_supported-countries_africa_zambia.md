# Collect tax in Zambia

## Learn how to use Stripe Tax to calculate, collect, and report tax in Zambia.

In Zambia, Stripe only supports collecting VAT for electronic services. In
Stripe, these are referred to as “digital products.” To collect this tax on
Stripe, you must be a remote seller without a physical presence in the country.

## When to register for tax collection

See [Thresholds](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/thresholds) to get insights
about your potential tax registration obligations in Zambia. Stripe also
notifies you with email and Dashboard alerts when you need to register to
collect tax. Learn more about how the [monitoring tool
works](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/monitoring).

Remote sellers providing digital goods or electronically supplied services
(digital products) to consumers in Zambia have a registration threshold of
800,000 ZMW for a calendar year. Sales to business customers in Zambia don’t
trigger any tax registration obligations as remote sellers aren’t required to
collect tax on these sales.

- **Threshold**: 800,000 ZMW
- **Time frame**: Calendar year
- **Included transactions**: Business-to-consumer (B2C) sales of digital goods
or electronically supplied services (digital products)

## How we calculate taxes

We only support calculations for [digital
products](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes?type=digital) (non-physical
items or services that are delivered, given, or rendered electronically) in
Zambia. Stripe doesn’t calculate tax for products that don’t use a digital
product tax code.

View the list of supported [digital product tax
codes](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes?type=digital). To calculate taxes
in Zambia, make sure that you [assign a tax
code](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/products-prices-tax-codes-tax-behavior#tax-code-on-product)
to each of your products.

## Report and file your taxes

Stripe provides reports of your completed tax transactions. Go to
[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations) to access these
reports. Learn more about [the different types of
reports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports).

You’re responsible for filing and remitting your taxes to Zambia. Stripe doesn’t
file taxes on your behalf.
