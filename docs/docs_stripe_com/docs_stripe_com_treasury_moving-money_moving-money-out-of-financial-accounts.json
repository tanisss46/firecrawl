You might\nuse `PaymentMethods` to save your vendors’ account data so you don’t have to\nre-enter and collect their information for every payment you make to them.\n\nYou can attach `PaymentMethods` containing bank account information to a\ncustomer (for sending money to a third party) or to a Stripe account (for\nsending money to a company’s own external bank account). In both cases, you\ncreate the `PaymentMethod` using\n[SetupIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/setup-intents) endpoints.\n\nThe type of Treasury requests you make with a `PaymentMethod` depends on how\nthey’re attached:\n\n- For customer-attached, use `PaymentIntent` and `OutboundPayment` requests.\n- For account-attached, use `InboundTransfer` and `OutboundTransfer` requests.\n\nSee [Working with SetupIntents, PaymentMethods, and\nBankAccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/working-with-bankaccount-objects)\nfor more information.\n\n## Handling returned funds\n\nThe destination for `OutboundTransfers` and `OutboundPayments` can reject the\nrelative flow. For example, the destination address might not exist and the\n`OutboundTransfer` or `OutboundPayment` fails. This can occur over the `ach` and\n`us_domestic_wire` networks. `CreditReversals` can also return\n`OutboundPayments` over the `stripe` network. In the case of returned funds, the\n`OutboundTransfer` or `OutboundPayment` transitions to the `returned` status and\nStripe creates a transaction to return the funds to the source financial\naccount. Stripe also triggers a `treasury.outbound_transfer.returned` or\n`treasury.outbound_payment.returned` webhook.\n\n## Tracking outbound funds\n\nYou might need to track the status of an outbound transaction initiated from a\nfinancial account for several reasons. Examples of such situations include a\npayment that has been sent but not yet received, or a payment that appears to be\narriving late. To help you in tracking `OutboundTransfers` and\n`OutboundPayments`, we provide network-specific tracking IDs for you to work\nwith banks to track their status.\n\n### Tracking an ACH transaction\n\nIf you’re sending funds over ACH rails, we recommend allowing up to three\nbusiness days for the transaction to process as per the standard timeline.\nAnytime after the transaction is submitted to our partner bank, you can use the\nACH trace ID to track the payment status, found in the\n`tracking_details[ach][trace_id]` field of the `OutboundTransfer` or\n`OutboundPayment` object. You can share this trace ID with the receiving bank to\nhelp identify potential issues.\n\n### Tracking a wire transaction\n\nDepending on the destination bank and the time of submission, our bank partner\nmight send domestic wire transfers over either FedWire or CHIPS. If you\noriginate a wire out of a Financial account at Evolve, it’s sent using FedWire.\nIf you originate a wire out of a Financial Account at Fifth Third, it’s sent\nusing CHIPS provided the receiving bank accepts CHIPS and the wire is sent\nduring CHIPS operating hours; otherwise, it’s sent using FedWire.\n\nFor wires sent using FedWire transfers, locate the IMAD and OMAD fields in the\n`tracking_details[us_domestic_wire][imad]` and\n`tracking_details[us_domestic_wire][omad]` fields.\n\nFor wires sent using CHIPS, locate the transfer’s System Sequence Number in\n`tracking_details[us_domestic_wire][chips]`. You can share these IDs with the\nreceiving bank to track the wire transfer’s status.\n\nThe `tracking_details` field can populate anytime after the transaction is\nsubmitted to our partner bank and is no longer cancelable. Stripe also fires the\n`treasury.outbound_payment.tracking_details_updated` or\n`treasury.outbound_transfers.tracking_details_updated` webhook when there’s an\nupdate to the `tracking_details` field.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Moving money with Treasury using OutboundPayment\nobjects](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/financial-accounts/out-of/outbound-payments)\n- [Moving money with Treasury using OutboundTransfer\nobjects](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/financial-accounts/out-of/outbound-transfers)\n- [Moving money with Treasury using ReceivedDebit\nobjects](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/financial-accounts/out-of/received-debits)\n- [Moving money with Treasury using DebitReversal\nobjects](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/financial-accounts/out-of/debit-reversals)\n- [Working with Stripe Issuing\ncards](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/account-management/issuing-cards)\n\n## Links\n\n- [PaymentMethod](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods)\n- [SetupIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/setup-intents)\n- [Working with SetupIntents, PaymentMethods, and\nBankAccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/working-with-bankaccount-objects)\n- [Moving money with Treasury using OutboundPayment\nobjects](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/financial-accounts/out-of/outbound-payments)\n- [Moving money with Treasury using OutboundTransfer\nobjects](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/financial-accounts/out-of/outbound-transfers)\n- [Moving money with Treasury using ReceivedDebit\nobjects](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/financial-accounts/out-of/received-debits)\n- [Moving money with Treasury using DebitReversal\nobjects](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/financial-accounts/out-of/debit-reversals)\n- [Working with Stripe Issuing\ncards](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/account-management/issuing-cards)",
