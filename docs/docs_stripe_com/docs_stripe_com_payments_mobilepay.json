It allows your customer to\n[authenticate and\napprove](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#customer-actions)\npayments using the MobilePay app.\n\nWhen your customer pays with MobilePay, Stripe performs a card transaction using\nthe card data we receive from MobilePay. The processing of the card transaction\nis invisible to your integration, and Stripe [immediately notifies\nyou](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#payment-notification)\nwhether the payment succeeded or failed.\n\nPayment method propertiesCountry availability- **Customer locations**\n\nDenmark and Finland\n- **Presentment currency**\n\nDKK, EUR, NOK, SEK\n- **Payment confirmation**\n\nCustomer-initiated\n- **Payment method family**\n\nDigital wallet\n- **Recurring payments**\n\nNo\n- **Payout timing**\n\n[Standard payout timing](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts#payout-speed) applies\n- **Connect support**\n\nYes\n- **Dispute support**\n\nYes\n- **Manual capture support**\n\nYes\n- **Refunds / Partial refunds**\n\nYes / yes\n\n## Payment flows\n\nCustomers pay with MobilePay by using one of the following methods:\n\nMobileDesktop\nCustomers follow a mobile redirect from your website or mobile app to the\nMobilePay app where they authorize the payment, then return to your website or\nmobile app.\n\n## Get started\n\nYou don’t have to integrate MobilePay and other payment methods individually. If\nyou use our front-end products, Stripe automatically determines the most\nrelevant payment methods to display. Go to the [Stripe\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and enable\nMobilePay. To get started with one of our hosted UIs, follow a quickstart:\n\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart): Our prebuilt, hosted\ncheckout page.\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart): Our drop-in UI\ncomponents.\n\n### Other payment products\n\nThe following Stripe products also let you add MobilePay from the Dashboard:\n\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n\nYou can also [manually configure MobilePay as a payment\nmethod](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/mobilepay/accept-a-payment).\n\n## Connect\n\nYou can use [Stripe Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/how-connect-works)\nwith MobilePay to process payments. Connect users can use MobilePay with the\nfollowing charge types:\n\n- [Direct](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges)\n- [Destination](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges)\n- [Separate charges and\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n### Enable MobilePay for connected accounts\n\nConnected accounts with access to the full Stripe Dashboard can enable MobilePay\nin their [Payment methods\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods). To check which\naccounts have enabled MobilePay, use the `capabilities` hash in our [accounts\nwebhooks or\nAPIs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-capabilities-mobilepay_payments)\nto see if the `mobilepay_payments` capability is set to `active`.\n\nFor connected accounts that don’t have access to the full Stripe Dashboard, see\n[enable payment methods for your connected\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities). The name of the\nconnected account is the name customers see during checkout and in the MobilePay\napp.\n\n## Refunds\n\nMobilePay supports full and partial refunds. You can also issue multiple partial\nrefunds up to the amount of the original charge.\n\n## Disputes\n\nMobilePay allows transaction disputes. Customers can open disputes directly with\ntheir cards issuer for cases of suspected fraud, double payments, or a\ndifference between an order and a transaction amount. You can submit evidence to\ncontest a dispute directly. The dispute process is the same as that for card\npayments. Learn how to [manage\ndisputes](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/responding).\n\n## Card transaction retries\n\nMobilePay allows customers to retry payments in-app before marking a payment as\nfailed and redirecting to your website. When a card transaction fails, the\ncustomer can retry a payment using a different card, which might result in a\nsuccessful payment.\n\n## 3D Secure authentication\n\nCertain cards or banks might require an additional card authentication step to\nprocess the MobilePay transaction.\n\nWhen this occurs, the customer is presented with a WebView dialog in the\nMobilePay application, prompting them to authorize the payment. The need to\nperform a [3D Secure challenge](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure) is\ninvisible to your integration and there are no extra integration steps for you\nto handle.\n\nThe expected impact varies, depending on customer country and card network:\n\nCountryCard brandPayments requiring 3DS\nstep-upDenmarkVisa~1%DenmarkMastercard~1.5%FinlandVisa~5%FinlandMastercard~7\n### Liability shift\n\n[Liability\nshift](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure/authentication-flow#disputed-payments)\ndoesn’t apply to MobilePay payments unless [3D Secure\nauthentication](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure) has taken place.\nMobilePay doesn’t allow you the option to enforce 3D Secure authentication on\nthe underlying card payment.\n\n## Prohibited business categories\n\nIn addition to the categories of [businesses restricted from using\nStripe](https://stripe.com/restricted-businesses), the following categories are\nspecifically prohibited from using MobilePay:\n\n- Cryptocurrencies\n- Stock trade\n- Gambling\n- Betting\n- Bonds\n- Money transfers\n- Debt collection\n- Multi-level marketing and pyramid schemes\n\nFor more information about MobilePay eligibility for your account, review your\n[Payment methods\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) in the\nDashboard.\n\n## Current limitations\n\n### Account icons\n\nThe MobilePay transaction confirmation page displays the default Stripe account\nicon instead of a configurable custom logo. Stripe will notify you when feature\nimprovements become available so you can update your account configuration as\nneeded.\n\n![A screenshot of a successful MobilePay\npayment.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/mobilepay-no-merchant-logo.f6f41b7fecbbd48cfabcbff85521ec6d.png)\n\nAn example confirmation page for a successful MobilePay payment.\n\n### Manual captures\n\nAt this time, MobilePay only supports automatic captures and [manual captures of\nthe full\namount](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/place-a-hold-on-a-payment-method).\nStripe will notify you as feature improvements become available for manual\ncaptures of partial amounts.\n\n### Dankort support\n\nStripe currently doesn’t have support for the Dankort card network. If a\ncustomer chooses to pay with a Dankort-branded card, Stripe processes the\npayment on the Visa and Mastercard networks instead.\n\n## Fees\n\nStripe receives card data from MobilePay to process card transactions using\nStripe’s Visa and Mastercard integrations. Because MobilePay payments are card\ntransactions, you incur the following fees for each successful transaction:\n\n- Stripe processing fees associated with the card transaction\n- Applicable taxes\n- MobilePay transaction processing fee\n- An additional monthly membership fee (applicable only to businesses registered\nin Denmark)\n\nThe MobilePay transaction fee isn’t subtracted immediately from the transaction.\nInstead, Stripe bills them once a day.\n\n### Stripe processing fees and taxes\n\nAfter a successful transaction, Stripe automatically deducts the Stripe\ntransaction fees and applicable taxes from the original transaction amount and\nprovides the remaining amount on your Stripe balance. These fees are identical\nto a standard card transaction.\n\nMobilePay is subject to the [standard payout schedule applicable to your\ncountry](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts).\n\n### MobilePay processing fee\n\nThe MobilePay processing fee isn’t presented within the net amount of a\nsuccessful transaction. Instead, Stripe bills the MobilePay processing fee once\na day, at which point we automatically deduct the sum that you owe from your\n[Stripe balance](https://dashboard.stripe.com/balance).\n\n### MobilePay monthly processing fee\n\nMobilePay charges a fixed 35 DKK monthly membership fee to all businesses\nregistered in Denmark that use its services. Stripe bills this fee once a month\n(if applicable), at which point we automatically deduct the sum that you owe\nfrom your [Stripe balance](https://dashboard.stripe.com/balance).\n\nThe incurred MobilePay fees are listed as a separate entry on your monthly tax\ninvoice. You can find your monthly invoices in the\n[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/documents).\n\n## Links\n\n- [single-use](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#usage)\n- [authenticate and\napprove](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#customer-actions)\n- [immediately notifies\nyou](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#payment-notification)\n- [Standard payout timing](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts#payout-speed)\n- [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods)\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart)\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart)\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n- [manually configure MobilePay as a payment\nmethod](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/mobilepay/accept-a-payment)\n- [Stripe Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/how-connect-works)\n- [Direct](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges)\n- [Destination](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges)\n- [Separate charges and\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n- [accounts webhooks or\nAPIs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-capabilities-mobilepay_payments)\n- [enable payment methods for your connected\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities)\n- [manage disputes](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/responding)\n- [3D Secure challenge](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure)\n- [Liability\nshift](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure/authentication-flow#disputed-payments)\n- [businesses restricted from using\nStripe](https://stripe.com/restricted-businesses)\n- [manual captures of the full\namount](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/place-a-hold-on-a-payment-method)\n- [standard payout schedule applicable to your\ncountry](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts)\n- [Stripe balance](https://dashboard.stripe.com/balance)\n- [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/documents)",
