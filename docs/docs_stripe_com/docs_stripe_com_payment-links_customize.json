  "content": "# Customize checkout for Payment Links\n\n## Collect additional information, taxes, or update your branding.\n\nWhen you create a payment link, you can customize the look and feel of a\ncheckout session for your user. You can also choose what type of customer\ninformation to collect and save for later.\n\nSee [After a payment link\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links/post-payment) for more\ninformation about customizing a session post-payment, such as redirecting the\ncustomer to a branded confirmation page or emailing a receipt.\n\n## Limit the number of times a payment link can be paid\n\nYou can limit the amount of times a payment link is paid for. This is helpful,\nfor example, if you have limited inventory, or only want the links to be used\nonce. When the payment link reaches the limit, it automatically deactivates and\ncustomers can’t use it to make a purchase. If a customer tries to open the link\nafter the limit has been reached, they’re shown the default message for\ndeactivated links or [a message that you can\ncustomize](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links/customize#custom-deactivated-link-message).\n\nA payment link is considered “paid for” when a checkout session is complete. You\ncan see the payments for completed checkout sessions in two different ways,\ndepending on the type of payment link:\n\n- For payment links that include subscriptions (that is, any link that has a\n[recurring price](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models)), go\nto **Billing** > **Subscriptions**.\n- For all other payment links, go to the payment link’s details page, then\n**Payments and analytics** > **Recent payments**.\nDashboardAPI\nTo limit the number of payments using the Dashboard:\n\n- [Create](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payment-links/create) or edit a payment\nlink.\n- Select **Limit the number of payments** and enter the number of payments you\nwant to allow before the link deactivates.\n\n## Set a custom message for deactivated links\n\nIf customers try to open a deactivated payment link, they’re shown a default\nmessage. You can customize this message in the Dashboard or with the API.\n\nDashboardAPI\nYou can customize the message for a deactivated link in the Dashboard in two\nways:\n\n- When you [create](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payment-links/create) or edit a\npayment link, select **Limit the number of payments**. Then select **Change\ndeactivation message** and add your custom message.\n- When you attempt to deactivate a payment link, a modal with a prompt to change\nthe default deactivation message appears. Use that to update the message.\n\n## Collect customer addresses and phone numbers\n\nYou can collect addresses and phone numbers with payment links by adding those\nfields to the checkout session.\n\nDashboardAPI\n### Collect an address\n\nTo collect addresses from your customers:\n\n- [Create](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payment-links/create) or edit a payment\nlink.\n\nTo edit a payment link go to its details page and click the overflow menu ().\n- Select **Collect customers’ addresses** in the **Options** section.\n- You can collect **Billing addresses only** or you can collect **Billing and\nshipping addresses**. Choosing either makes these fields required for customers.\n- If you collect shipping addresses:\n\n- You need to select the countries you ship to. These countries appear in the\n**Country** dropdown in the **Shipping Address form** in the checkout session.\n- You can optionally add shipping rates.\n\n### Collect a phone number\n\nIf you need to collect phone numbers to complete the transaction:\n\n- [Create](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payment-links/create) or edit a payment\nlink.\n- Select **Require customers to provide a phone number**.\n\nYou can configure Payment Links to always collect a billing address, or always\ncollect both a billing and a shipping address. When you collect shipping\naddresses, you can define the allowed values for shipping countries, and create\none or more shipping rates to include in your link.\n\nYou can configure Payment Links to collect a phone number for shipping or\ninvoicing. Only collect phone numbers if you need them for the transaction. When\nchoosing this option, the payment page shows a required field to capture your\ncustomer’s phone number.\n\n## Collect business customer tax IDs\n\nTo display a customer’s tax ID and legal business name on invoices, enable tax\nID collection on your Payment Links. Learn how to [collect customer tax IDs with\nCheckout](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/checkout/tax-ids).\n\n## Collect taxes\n\nPayment Links work with [Stripe Tax](https://stripe.com/tax) to calculate and\ncollect tax on your payments. Stripe Tax is a paid product that automatically\ncalculates the tax on your transactions without the need to define the rates and\nrules.\n\nFees only apply after you’ve added at least one location where you’re registered\nto calculate and remit tax.\n\nTo get started, [activate Stripe\nTax](https://dashboard.stripe.com/setup/tax/activate) in the Dashboard. Learn\nhow to use [products, prices, tax codes, and tax\nbehavior](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/products-prices-tax-codes-tax-behavior) to\nautomatically calculate tax.\n\nDashboardAPI\nTo enable automatic tax collection using the Dashboard:\n\n- [Create](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payment-links/create) or edit a payment\nlink.\n- Select **Collect tax automatically**.\n\nTo accurately determine tax, Stripe Tax collects the customer’s billing address\n(full address for US customers).\n\n## Collect agreement to your terms of service\n\nYou can require that your customers accept your terms of service before\ncompleting their purchase. When your terms of service URL is set in your\naccount’s [Public details](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public), you\nhave the option to require a terms of service agreement when you create a\npayment link in the Dashboard. Enabling this setting requires that your\ncustomers click a checkbox to accept your terms in their checkout page. The\ncheckout page also links to your Privacy policy when a URL to your Privacy\npolicy is set your [public\ndetails](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public).\n\n## Add custom fields\n\n#### Caution\n\nDon’t use custom fields to collect personal, protected, or sensitive data, or\ninformation restricted by law.\n\nYou can add custom fields on the payment form to collect additional information\nfrom your customers. The information is available after the payment is complete\nand is useful for fulfilling the purchase. You can add the following types of\nfields.\n\nTypeDescriptionTextCollects freeform text up to 255 characters.Numbers\nonlyCollects only numerical values up to 255 digits.DropdownPresents your\ncustomers with a list of options to select from. Payment links created through\nthe Dashboard support up to 10 options. You can add up to 200 options after you\ncreate a link through the API.- Click **Add custom fields** in the **Options**\nsection.\n- Select a type of field to add.\n- Enter a label for the field.\n- *(Optional)* Mark your field as required.\n\nLabels for custom fields aren’t translated, but you can use the `locale` [URL\nparameter](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links/customize#customize-checkout-with-url-parameters)\nto set the language of your payment link to match the same language as your\nlabels.\n\n!\n\nAfter your customer completes the payment, you can view the fields on the\npayment details page in the Dashboard.\n\n!\n\nThe custom fields are also sent in the\n[checkout.session.completed](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-checkout.session.completed)\n[webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) upon payment completion.\n\n## Automatically convert prices to local currencies\n\nEnable [Adaptive\nPricing](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/adaptive-pricing) in the\n[Stripe\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/automatic_currency_conversion)\nin either test or live mode to let prices automatically convert to an\ninternational customer’s local currency depending on their location.\n\nAlternatively, you can set pricing manually for each currency using [manual\ncurrency\nprices](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/manual-currency-prices).\n\n## Save payment details for future use\n\n#### Caution\n\nConsult with your legal counsel or compliance team regarding saving and using\npayment details. For example, the European Data Protection Board issued\n[guidance](https://edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2021-05/recommendations022021_on_storage_of_credit_card_data_en_1.pdf)\nregarding the saving of payment details for faster future checkouts.\n\nIf you want to save the payment method information to provide returning\ncustomers an optional 1-click payment experience in the future, we recommend\nusing\n[Link](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/customization/behavior#link).\n\nTo save payment details for a customer, select **Save payment details for future\nuse** in the **Advanced options** section when you [create a Payment\nLink](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payment-links/create).\n\n## Apply branding\n\nYou can customize the look and feel of the payment page in the Stripe Dashboard.\nGo to your [branding\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/branding/checkout) to:\n\n- Upload a logo or icon\n- Customize the payment page’s background color, button color, font, and shapes\n\nLearn more about [custom fonts and font\ncompatibility](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/customization/appearance#font-compatibility).\n\n## Use your own domain\n\nIf you have your own custom domain, you can add it in the Stripe Dashboard.\nInstead of Stripe-branded payment links (`buy.stripe.com/`), you can create\nlinks using your own subdomain (`pay.example.com`)\n\n#### Note\n\nLearn more about [custom\ndomains](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/custom-domains).\n\n## Set store policies and contact information\n\nYou can display your return, refund, and legal policies on the payment page in\naddition to your support contact information.\n\nGo to the [Checkout and Payment Links\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/checkout) to configure the\ninformation you want to display.\n\nPresenting this information can increase buyer confidence and minimize [cart\nabandonment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/abandoned-carts).\n\n## Customize checkout with URL parameters\n\nURL parameters allow you to add additional context to your payment page and\nstreamline checkout. Specify the language that appears during checkout, prefill\nan email address or promotional code for your customers, track campaigns, and\nstreamline reconciliation.\n\nYou can configure URL parameters directly from the Stripe Dashboard, and use\nthem in the query string of your payment link URL. From the [payment links\npage](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payment-links), click a specific payment\nlink, then click the dropdown menu on the **** button to add URL parameters.\n\nHere’s an example link with prefilled email, promotional code, and locale\nparameters.\n\n```\n\nhttps://buy.stripe.com/test_eVa3do41l4Ye6KkcMN?prefilled_email=jenny%40example.com&prefilled_promo_code=20off&locale=de\n\n```\n\nParameterDescriptionSyntax\n`prefilled_email`\n\nUse `prefilled_email` to enter an email address on the payment page\nautomatically. Your end customer can still edit this field, so the email you\npass in for `prefilled_email` might not be the same email that your customer\nuses to complete the payment.\n\n`prefilled_email` must be a valid email address. Invalid values are silently\ndropped and your payment page continues to work as expected.\n\nWe recommend [encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding) email\naddresses that you attach as URL parameters to reduce the risk of them not being\npassed through to your payment page.\n\n`prefilled_promo_code`\n\nUse `prefilled_promo_code` to enter a [promotion\ncode](https://docs.stripe.com/api/promotion_codes) on the payment page\nautomatically. Your customer can still edit this field, so the promotion code\nyou pass in for `prefilled_promo_code` might not be the same promotion code that\nyour customer uses to complete the payment.\n\nYou must also [enable promotion\ncodes](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links/promotions) on your payment link,\nor this parameter has no effect.\n\n`prefilled_promo_code` must be composed of alphanumeric characters and can’t use\nany special characters. Promotion codes are case insensitive. Invalid values are\nsilently dropped, and your payment page continues to work as expected.\n\n`locale`Use `locale` to display your payment link in a specific language for\nyour customers regardless of their location.View the complete list of all\n[supported\nlanguages](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-locale).\nYou can also use URL parameters to [track payment links and related\ncampaigns](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links/url-parameters).\n\n## Limit customers to one subscription\n\nYou can redirect customers that already have a subscription to the [customer\nportal](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/customer-portal) or your\nwebsite to manage their subscription. Learn more about [limiting customers to\none\nsubscription](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/limit-subscriptions).\n\n## Support free trials without collecting payment method details\n\nFor Payment Links that you create with a product that includes a free trial, you\ncan allow customers to sign up for a subscription without providing their\npayment method details.\n\nDashboardAPI\nTo configure trials without payment methods for Payment Links in the Dashboard:\n\n- When you [create](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payment-links/create) or edit a\npayment link with a subscription product, select **Include a free trial**. Then\nselect **Let customers start trial without payment method**.\n- Set [subscription email\nreminders](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/free-trials#collect-payment)\nto make sure that Stripe prompts your customer to add their payment information\nbefore the trial ends. Otherwise, Stripe pauses the trial.\n\n## Links\n\n- [After a payment link\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links/post-payment)\n- [recurring price](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models)\n- [Create](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payment-links/create)\n- [collect customer tax IDs with\nCheckout](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/checkout/tax-ids)\n- [Stripe Tax](https://stripe.com/tax)\n- [activate Stripe Tax](https://dashboard.stripe.com/setup/tax/activate)\n- [products, prices, tax codes, and tax\nbehavior](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/products-prices-tax-codes-tax-behavior)\n- [Public details](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public)\n- [URL\nparameter](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links/customize#customize-checkout-with-url-parameters)\n-\n[checkout.session.completed](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-checkout.session.completed)\n- [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks)\n- [Adaptive Pricing](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/adaptive-pricing)\n- [Stripe\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/automatic_currency_conversion)\n- [manual currency\nprices](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/manual-currency-prices)\n-\n[guidance](https://edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2021-05/recommendations022021_on_storage_of_credit_card_data_en_1.pdf)\n- [Link](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/customization/behavior#link)\n- [create a Payment\nLink](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payment-links/create)\n- [branding settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/branding/checkout)\n- [custom fonts and font\ncompatibility](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/customization/appearance#font-compatibility)\n- [custom domains](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/custom-domains)\n- [Checkout and Payment Links\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/checkout)\n- [cart abandonment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/abandoned-carts)\n- [payment links page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payment-links)\n- [encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding)\n- [promotion code](https://docs.stripe.com/api/promotion_codes)\n- [enable promotion codes](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links/promotions)\n- [supported\nlanguages](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-locale)\n- [track payment links and related\ncampaigns](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links/url-parameters)\n- [customer\nportal](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/customer-portal)\n- [limiting customers to one\nsubscription](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/limit-subscriptions)\n- [subscription email\nreminders](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/free-trials#collect-payment)",
