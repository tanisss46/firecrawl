This allows you to present\nprices in a customer’s native currency and avoid conversion costs for customers.\nThe currencies you can use are determined by the country of the Stripe account\nwhere the charge is made.\n\nCharge typeCurrency determined by[Direct\ncharges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges)Country of the connected\naccount[Destination\ncharges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges)Country of the\nplatform account[Destination\ncharges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges) using\n`on_behalf_of`Country of the connected account[Separate charges and\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)Country\nof the platform account[Separate charges and\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers) using\n`on_behalf_of` at charge timeCountry of the connected account\n## Currency conversions\n\nA currency conversion occurs if the *presentment* currency differs from the\n*settlement* currency.\n\nThe presentment currency is the currency that’s used for charges. The settlement\ncurrency is the currency that you can receive\n[payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts) in, depending on the charge type and\napplicable currency conversion. See the [supported presentment\ncurrencies](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies) and the [supported settlement\ncurrencies](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/payouts-connected-accounts#supported-settlement).\n\nDepending on bank account or debit card availability, the following occurs when\npaying out a [balance](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-balances):\n\nBank account or debit card availabilityConversion actionAvailable for the\ncurrencyNo conversionMultiple bank accounts or debit cards available for the\ncurrencyNo conversion–Stripe uses the bank account or debit card set as\n`default_for_currency`Not available for the currencyStripe converts the payout\nbalance based on the Stripe account’s default currency\nIf you regularly charge in multiple currencies, you might be able to establish\n[multiple bank accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts#multiple-bank-accounts)\nto have multiple settlement currencies.\n\n[Currency conversions](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies/conversions) use the\ncurrent exchange rates provided by our service providers, with an additional\nconversion fee applied by Stripe. There are online resources for [conversion\ncalculation](https://dashboard.stripe.com/currency_conversion) that can help you\nestimate current market rates. However, these numbers can fluctuate and might\nnot reflect Stripe’s rates at the time a payment is processed.\n\n## Application fees for direct charges\n\nAlthough direct charges are in the connected account’s default currency, your\nplatform receives the [application\nfees](https://docs.stripe.com/api#application_fees) for [direct\ncharges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges) in your platform’s\ndefault currency.\n\nBank account or debit card availabilityConversion actionAvailable for the\nsettlement currencyNo conversionNot available for the settlement currencyStripe\nconverts the application fee based on the platform account’s default currency\nIf your platform doesn’t use application fees and retains a portion of the\ncharges instead, those funds are paid out (and converted or not) the same way as\nother charges on the platform account.\n\n## Application fees for destination charges and converting balances\n\nApplication fees collected using the `application_fee_amount` parameter aren’t\nconverted again for [destination\ncharges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges); platforms always\nreceive application fees in the connected account’s settlement currency. Use the\n`transfer_data[amount]` parameter to transfer less of the transaction amount and\ncollect fees in the platform’s default settlement currency.\n\nIf you create charges on the platform using the `destination` or `on_behalf_of`\nparameters, you might accumulate balances in multiple currencies. If you don’t\nhave bank accounts for these other currencies, Stripe provides a way to pay out\nbalances in non-default currencies to your platform’s default bank account.\n\nThese currency conversions are created as manual payouts with `currency` set as\nthe currency of the source balance:\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payouts \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d amount=1000 \\\n -d currency=xaf\n```\n\nAs long as there are sufficient funds in the balance for the specified currency,\nStripe automatically converts the funds to the default bank account’s currency.\n\n## Example scenarios\n\nThe following examples illustrate how to work with multiple currencies in\n[Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect):\n\n### Direct charges\n\nWhen the [presentment\ncurrency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#presentment-currencies) is\ndifferent from the connected account’s default currency, Stripe converts [direct\ncharges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges) to the connected\naccount’s default currency. If the presentment currency is also different from\nthe platform’s default currency, the [application\nfee](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees) is converted\nto the platform’s default currency.\n\nFor example, you accept a charge for a connected account in USD. Your platform\nsettles in USD and your connected account settles in EUR. The connected\naccount’s funds are converted to EUR and the application fee settles to your\nplatform in USD [without\nconversion](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/currencies#application-fees-for-direct-charges).\n\n### Destination charges without on_behalf_of\n\nWhen processing [destination\ncharges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges) without\n`on_behalf_of`, Stripe first converts them from the [presentment\ncurrency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#presentment-currencies) to the\nplatform’s default currency. The funds sent to the connected account are then\nconverted to the connected account’s default currency.\n\n- If an `application_fee_amount` is used, the [application\nfee](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges?fee-type=application-fee#collect-fees)\nis collected after the conversion to the connected account’s default currency.\nThe fee remains in that currency when added to the platform.\n- If `transfer_data[amount]` is used, the fee is collected after the first\ncurrency conversion and remains in the platform’s default currency.\n\n#### Note\n\nThis charge flow is subject to Stripe’s regional and [cross-border\npolicies](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/cross-border-payouts).\n\nFor example, you accept a destination charge for a connected account in EUR. The\nconnected account settles in GBP, and your platform settles in USD. The charge\nis converted from EUR to USD and the funds sent to the connected account are\nconverted to GBP.\n\n- If `application_fee_amount` is used, the application fee amount is converted\nfrom EUR to GBP and taken from the amount that settles on the connected account.\n- If `transfer_data[amount]` is used, the fee is retained in USD after\nconverting from the initial presentment currency.\n\n### Destination charges with on_behalf_of\n\nWhen processing [destination\ncharges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges) with\n`on_behalf_of`, Stripe first converts them from the [presentment\ncurrency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#presentment-currencies) to the\nconnected account’s default currency. The [application\nfee](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges?fee-type=application-fee#collect-fees)\nremains in the connected account’s currency, regardless of whether\n`application_fee_amount` or `transfer_data[amount]` is used.\n\nFor example, the connected account accepts a charge in USD but settles in EUR.\nThe charge is converted to EUR and sent to the connected account in EUR. The fee\nis collected in EUR regardless of whether `application_fee_amount` or\n`transfer_data[amount]` is used.\n\n### Separate charges and transfers without on_behalf_of\n\n[Separate\ncharges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers) are\nconverted to the platform’s default currency from the [presentment\ncurrency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#presentment-currencies) and the\nplatform later transfers the funds to the connected account. The\n`application_fee_amount` and `transfer_data[amount]` parameters are not used to\ncollect fees, since the platform can choose the appropriate amount to send at\ntransfer time.\n\n#### Note\n\nThis charge flow is subject to Stripe’s regional and [cross-border\npolicies](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/cross-border-payouts).\n\n### Separate charges and transfers with on_behalf_of\n\n[Separate\ncharges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers) are\nconverted to the connected account’s default currency from the [presentment\ncurrency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#presentment-currencies) and the\nplatform later transfers the funds to the connected account. The\n`application_fee_amount` and `transfer_data[amount]` parameters are not used to\ncollect fees, since the platform can choose the appropriate amount to send at\ntransfer time.\n\n#### Note\n\nThis charge flow is subject to Stripe’s regional and [cross-border\npolicies](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/cross-border-payouts).\n\n## See also\n\n- [Creating charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges)\n- [Creating direct charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges)\n- [Using subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/subscriptions)\n\n## Links\n\n- [135+ currencies](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies)\n- [Direct charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges)\n- [Destination charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges)\n- [Separate charges and\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n-\n[on_behalf_of](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers#settlement-merchant)\n- [payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts)\n- [supported settlement\ncurrencies](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/payouts-connected-accounts#supported-settlement)\n- [balance](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-balances)\n- [multiple bank\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts#multiple-bank-accounts)\n- [Currency conversions](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies/conversions)\n- [conversion calculation](https://dashboard.stripe.com/currency_conversion)\n- [application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api#application_fees)\n- [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)\n- [presentment\ncurrency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#presentment-currencies)\n- [application fee](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\n- [application\nfee](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges?fee-type=application-fee#collect-fees)\n- [cross-border policies](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/cross-border-payouts)\n- [Creating charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges)\n- [Using subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/subscriptions)",
