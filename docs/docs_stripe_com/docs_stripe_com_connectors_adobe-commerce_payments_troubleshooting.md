# Troubleshooting for Adobe Commerce

## Learn how to troubleshoot the Stripe Connector for Adobe Commerce.

Use this guide to troubleshoot the Stripe Connector for Adobe Commerce.

## Installation issues

The most common issue during the installation process is getting the following
error when using Composer:

```
Composer package not found: Could not find a matching version of package
stripe/stripe-payments

```

If you encounter this problem, follow these steps:

- Order the module from the [Adobe
Marketplace](https://marketplace.magento.com/stripe-stripe-payments.html).
- Delete the file under `~/.composer/auth.json` in case you entered the wrong
Adobe Commerce API keys.
- Run the Composer command again. You might have to enter a username and
password. Make sure that you enter the Adobe Commerce API keys of the account
that you used to place the order. You can [get your authentication
keys](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/install-gde/prereq/connect-auth.html)
from Adobe Commerce.

## Upgrades and caching issues

If you upgrade the module but for some reason don’t see the new changes, you can
manually clear the Adobe Commerce cache by deleting a set of directories. The
official Adobe Commerce documentation describes which directories to delete for
[Adobe Commerce
2.3](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/howdoi/php/php_clear-dirs.html) and
[Adobe Commerce
2.4](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/howdoi/php/php_clear-dirs.html).

After you delete these directories, run the following commands:

```
php bin/magento setup:upgrade
php bin/magento cache:flush
```

If you’re running in production mode, you have to compile and deploy your static
assets:

```
php bin/magento setup:di:compile
php bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy
```

If you’re running Varnish, you must also restart Varnish after deleting the
var/cache/* files. Some browsers also cache Adobe Commerce requests; if you
still have caching issues, try a different browser.

## No payment method at checkout

The payment method may not show at checkout for a few possible reasons:

- You’re missing the Stripe PHP library or you’re using an old version. You can
install this dependency by following step 3 of the [installation
instructions](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/adobe-commerce/payments/install)
- You have another Stripe module installed that’s using an older version of the
Stripe PHP library. Disable or uninstall any other active Stripe module.
- You didn’t [configure the Stripe API
keys](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/adobe-commerce/payments/configuration#general-settings)
properly.
- You limited the availability of the payment method to specific countries or
currencies.

## Apple Pay or Google Pay not appearing

If you [configured the Payment Request
button](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/adobe-commerce/payments/configuration#express-checkout)
and it still doesn’t appear, try the following:

- Make sure that you enabled Apple Pay and Google Pay in your [payment methods
settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods).
- For Apple Pay, use Safari on an iPhone running iOS 10 and above.
- For Google Pay, use Chrome Desktop or Chrome Mobile with a logged in Google
account.
- Make sure that you have at least one card in your Wallet.- In iOS, you can add
a card by going to **Settings** > **Wallet** > **Apple Pay**.
- In Chrome, you can add a card by going to **Settings** > **Autofill** >
**Payment methods** > **Add new credit card**.
- Confirm that your [iOS device supports Apple
Pay](https://stripe.com/apple-pay).
- Confirm that your [Android device supports Google
Pay](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-js/elements/payment-request-button).
- Confirm that your [domain is registered and
verified](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/pmd-registration?dashboard-or-api=dashboard#register-your-domain).
- If your website domain starts with `www`, make sure the domain is
`www.example.com` and not `example.com`.
- You must serve your website over HTTPS using a valid
[TLS](https://docs.stripe.com/security/guide#tls) 1.2 certificate—check this
from your browser or from [SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/).
- Make sure that your HTTPS page doesn’t load any images, CSS, or JavaScript
insecurely. You can check this by clicking the padlock on your browser URL bar.
- Make sure that you enabled the **Wallet** button in the module’s configuration
section.
- Make sure that you configured a default fallback country (**Stores** >
**Configuration** > **General** > **Country Options** > **Default Country**).
- Make sure that you’re not using an older Stripe API key. Apple Pay requires a
modern API key, which starts with `pk_live_` or `pk_test_`. You can roll your
publishable key in the [Developers
section](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys) of the Dashboard.
- If you’re using a OneStepCheckout module, you may additionally need to
configure the OSC module to refresh the payment form when guest customers submit
their billing address. In most cases, this isn’t necessary.

If Apple Pay appears at checkout, but it doesn’t appear on the product pages, it
may be because of additional reasons:

- You disabled guest checkouts from the Adobe Commerce admin.
- Your website is serving your product pages without a valid TLS 1.2
certificate.
- You overwrote the **Add to Cart** button template in your theme. Try adding
some text to
`app/code/StripeIntegration/Payments/view/frontend/templates/express/product_button.phtml`.
If your product pages remain unchanged, customize your theme and integrate the
two templates together.
- JavaScript errors occur when Stripe.js is initializing. Check your browser
console for any JavaScript errors related to Stripe.js.

## Pending order stuck

When creating an order, the initial status is `Pending Payment`, which indicates
that the authorization of the payment by the customer’s bank is still pending.
For all redirect-based payment methods, when an authorization occurs, Stripe
notifies your website using [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks). If
your orders don’t change from `Pending Payment` to `Processing`, it might
indicate that webhooks are missing or incorrect.

Go to your [webhooks settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks) to check
if a webhook endpoint with your store URL exists. If not, you can try to
manually create it by running the following command from your Magento root
directory:

```
bin/magento stripe:webhooks:configure
```

If the webhook endpoint already exists, check the **Error Rate** to identify the
failing webhooks. You can click on the webhook endpoint to see the error
messages. To get assistance on webhook issues that aren’t due to incorrect
server configuration, contact [Stripe Support](https://support.stripe.com/) and
share details about the errors you encounter.

After fixing the webhook issue, you need to resend the `charge.succeeded` events
that weren’t delivered correctly to your website. The module provides three
commands to resend a single event, a range of events, or events within a date
range:

```
bin/magento stripe:webhooks:process-event [-f|--force] <event_id>
bin/magento stripe:webhooks:process-events-range <from_event_id> <to_event_id>
bin/magento stripe:webhooks:process-events-date-range <from_date> [<to_date>]

```

#### Note

You can set a full date and time (`2021-12-21 11:22:33+0200`) or use any 
textual datetime description (`last Monday`). This function uses your Magento
default timezone unless specified otherwise.

See [strtotime](https://www.php.net/strtotime) for all the supported date
formats.

You can get a list of all failed `charge.succeeded` events in the [Developers
section](https://dashboard.stripe.com/events?type=charge.succeeded&delivery_success=false)
of your Stripe Dashboard and decide which ones to resend using one of the
commands above.

## Error logging and server-side errors (HTTP 500)

Adobe Commerce logs any errors and exceptions it encounters during application
runtime in the `var/log` directory. You can find these errors in the following
two files:

```
var/log/system.log
var/log/exception.log

```

If you have SSH access, you can filter the error messages with the following
command:

```
grep -i Stripe var/log/system.log
```

You can display errors live in the console as they occur (or when you refresh a
given page). To monitor errors, run the following command to watch the error
log:

```
tail -f var/log/*
```

If you don’t have shell access, you can download this file and search for Stripe
errors with a text editor.
