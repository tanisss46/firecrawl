  "content": "# Stablecoin payouts for ConnectPrivate preview\n\n## Enable stablecoin payouts on your platform.\n\n#### Private preview\n\nThe Stablecoin Payouts feature is currently limited to private preview users. If\nyou’re interested in trying it out, [email\nus](mailto:stablecoin-payouts@stripe.com).\n\nStablecoin payouts let your platform pay out in stablecoins, starting with USDC.\nYou can use stablecoin payouts with your existing\n[Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect) integration to avoid managing\nstablecoins yourself. Your platform’s funds can remain in fiat currency, and\nStripe handles converting to stablecoins and paying it out.\n\n## How it works\n\nWhen you opt in to stablecoin payouts and provide your users access to the\n[Express Dashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/express-dashboard), your\nusers can link a crypto wallet with their account and set their default currency\nto USDC. Your users can link a crypto wallet using the Express Dashboard.\n\nWhen a user links a crypto wallet, they immediately see a new USDC balance on\ntheir connected account. The USDC balance works like any other local currency\nbalance. You can transfer funds into the balance and the funds are paid out to\ntheir linked crypto wallet instead of their bank account. When you create\n[Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers) in USD, they automatically\nconvert to the preferred currency of your recipients. This simplifies your\nintegration and enables you to have a unified integration across fiat and\nstablecoin payouts.\n\n## Considerations\n\n- **US platform activation**: Your platform must be in the US and activated. You\ncan activate it by [registering your\nplatform](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/set-up), [activating your\naccount](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/onboarding), and [completing the\nplatform profile](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/settings/profile).\n- **Individual recipients**: Recipients paid in stablecoins must be individuals\nor sole proprietors. Paying companies and non-profits in stablecoins isn’t\ncurrently supported.\n- **Express Dashboard access**: To pay an individual in stablecoins, create a\nconnected account for them with access to the Express Dashboard. They can link a\ncrypto wallet and choose their preferred currency in this Dashboard.\n- **Pay with the Transfers API**: You must use the [Transfers\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers) within your integration to pay in\nstablecoins. Transfers to connected accounts with linked crypto wallets are\nconverted from fiat to USDC, enabling you to pay in USDC while your platform\nbalance stays in fiat. If you haven’t built an integration yet, you can pay in\nstablecoins using a\n[no-code](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/add-and-pay-out-guide?dashboard-or-api?dashboard-or-api=dashboard)\nor [programmatic\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/add-and-pay-out-guide?dashboard-or-api?dashboard-or-api=api).\n\n### Supported countries\n\n## Onboarding\n\nBefore you can enable Stablecoin Payouts:\n\n- Make sure your Stripe account has been set up as a [Connect\nplatform](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/set-up/welcome).\n- [Email us](mailto:stablecoin-payouts@stripe.com) to gain access to this\npreview feature.
