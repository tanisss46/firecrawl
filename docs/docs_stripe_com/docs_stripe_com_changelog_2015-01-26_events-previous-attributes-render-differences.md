# Events with the previous_attributes field now only render the differences to objects across updatesBreaking changes

## What’s new

Updates the presentation of nested hashes in the `previous_attributes` property
of events to only show the difference. For example, a change from `{address:
{line1: "Foo", line2: "Bar"}}` to `{address: {line1: "Foo", line2: "Baz"}}` is
represented as `{previous_attributes: {address: {line2: "Baz"}}}`. Previously,
it was represented as `{previous_attributes: {address: {line1: "Foo", line2:
"Baz"}}}`.

## Impact

The `previous_attributes` property now only shows differences in nested hashes,
providing more focused change information.
