  "content": "# Dynamic payment methods\n\n## Simplify your payment methods code by dynamically ordering and displaying payment methods.\n\nDynamic payment methods is part of the [default Stripe\nintegration](https://stripe.com/blog/dynamic-payment-methods) and enables you to\nconfigure payment methods settings from the\n[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods)—no code\nrequired. When you use dynamic payment methods in a [Payment\nElement](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element) or\n[Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout) integration, Stripe\nhandles the logic for dynamically displaying the most relevant eligible payment\nmethods to each customer to maximize conversion. Dynamic payment methods also\nunlocks [customization\nfeatures](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/dynamic-payment-methods#customization-features)\nto help you customize and experiment with payment methods.\n\nUse dynamic payment methods to:\n\n- Turn on and manage most payment methods in the Dashboard\n- Eliminate the need to specify eligibility requirements for individual payment\nmethods\n- Dynamically order eligible payment methods to maximize conversion based on\nfactors such as customer device, location, and local currency\n- Set rules when payment methods are shown to buyers\n- Run A/B Tests for new payment methods before rolling them out to buyers\n\n## Integration options\n\nUse\n[Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web&ui=stripe-hosted)\nor [Payment\nElement](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web&ui=elements)\nwith dynamic payment methods to have Stripe handle the logic for displaying\neligible payment methods in your frontend for each transaction. If you have a\nplatform account, follow our [Connect\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dynamic-payment-methods).\n\n### Migrate to dynamic payment methods\n\n## Dashboard-based customization features\n\nAccess the following features with dynamic payment methods to control how and\nwhen payment methods render.\n\nFeatureDescription[Payment method\nrules](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-method-rules)Customize how you\ndisplay payment methods by setting targeting parameters based on amount or the\nbuyer’s location.[A/B test payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/a-b-testing)Turn on payment methods\nfor a percentage of traffic, run an experiment, and see the resulting impact on\nconversion rate, average order value, and shift in volume from other payment\nmethods.[Payment method\nconfigurations](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-method-configurations)Create\ndifferent sets of payment methods for different checkout scenarios using complex\nlogic, such as only showing specific payment methods for one-time purchases and\nanother set for recurring purchases.[Embed the Payment methods settings\ncomponent](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/embed-payment-method-settings)Embed a\npayment method settings page directly into your website to allow your users to\nmanage their payment methods.\n## How dynamic payment methods work\n\nReview this section to understand the criteria that Stripe uses to automatically\ndetermine eligible payment methods. If a specific payment method isn’t appearing\nin your payment flow, one or more of these criteria might not be met.\n\nStripe applies all these criteria when creating the payment, except for the\ncustomer’s country, which applies when the customer goes to the payment page.\n\n### Dashboard settings\n\nView the available payment methods in your [Stripe\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/payment_methods). Only\npayment methods that you enabled can be shown to your customers.\n\nIf a payment method isn’t listed in your Dashboard settings, it’s either not\nsupported by Stripe or not supported in the country where your account is\nregistered. For example, PayNow is only available to Stripe accounts in\nSingapore.\n\nLearn more about [country\nsupport](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/payment-method-support#country-currency-support).\n\n#### Note\n\nWhen using Stripe Connect with Direct Charges or `on_behalf_of`, the settings of\nthe connected account determines the available payment methods. You can\nconfigure them in your [connect\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/payment_methods/connected_accounts).\n\n### Product support\n\nSeveral Stripe products allow you to charge customers, such as Checkout Sessions\nand Payment Element. Not all payment methods are available in all products. For\nexample, Bacs Direct Debit isn’t available in the Mobile Payment Element. Some\npayment methods, such as Swish, don’t support recurring payments.\n\nLearn more about [product\nsupport](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/payment-method-support#product-support).\n\n### Presentment currency\n\nStripe supports over [135 presentment\ncurrencies](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#presentment-currencies), but most\npayment methods only support a subset of these. For example, ACH Direct Debit is\nonly available for payments in USD currency.\n\nLearn more about [currency\nsupport](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/payment-method-support#country-currency-support).\n\n### Charge amount\n\nOn top of the general [minimum and maximum\namount](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts)\nStripe supports, some payment methods have their own minimum and maximum. For\nexample, SEPA Direct Debit is only available for payments below 10,000 EUR.\n\n#### Note\n\nThe final amount, including tax and discounts, is the amount used to determine\navailable payment methods.\n\nTo learn more, go to the a payment method’s overview page.\n\n### API support\n\nSome payment methods, such as TWINT, can’t be set up for future usage. When you\nset `setup_future_usage`, some payment methods are automatically filtered out.\n\nSimilarly, some payment methods, such as iDEAL, don’t support [manual\ncapture](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/place-a-hold-on-a-payment-method).\nWhen you set `capture_method: manual`, some payment methods are automatically\nfiltered out.\n\nLearn more about [API\nsupport](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/payment-method-support#additional-api-supportability).\n\n### Customer’s country\n\nA customer’s country impacts which payment methods are available on the payment\npage, because most payment methods are available in a predefined number of\ncountries. For example, BLIK is only available for customers in Poland.\n\nLearn more about [country\nsupport](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/payment-method-support#country-currency-support).\n\n### Other considerations\n\nThe following features can also impact the availability of some payment methods:\n\n- [Payment method\nconfiguration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-method-configurations),\nto customize the payment method shown.\n- [Payment method rules](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-method-rules),\nto show or hide a payment method based on conditions, such as the amount and\ncurrencies.\n- [A/B testing](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/a-b-testing), to temporarily\nshow or hide a payment method to see its impact on conversion rates.\n\n## Links\n\n- [default Stripe integration](https://stripe.com/blog/dynamic-payment-methods)\n- [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods)\n- [Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element)\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout)\n- [customization\nfeatures](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/dynamic-payment-methods#customization-features)\n-\n[Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web&ui=stripe-hosted)\n- [Payment\nElement](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web&ui=elements)\n- [Connect integration](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dynamic-payment-methods)\n- [Payment method rules](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-method-rules)\n- [A/B test payment methods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/a-b-testing)\n- [Payment method\nconfigurations](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-method-configurations)\n- [Embed the Payment methods settings\ncomponent](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/embed-payment-method-settings)\n- [different criteria](https://docs.stripe.com/testing/wallets)\n- [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/payment_methods)\n- [country\nsupport](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/payment-method-support#country-currency-support)\n- [connect\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/payment_methods/connected_accounts)\n- [product\nsupport](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/payment-method-support#product-support)\n- [135 presentment\ncurrencies](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#presentment-currencies)\n- [minimum and maximum\namount](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts)\n- [manual\ncapture](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/place-a-hold-on-a-payment-method)\n- [API\nsupport](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/payment-method-support#additional-api-supportability)",
