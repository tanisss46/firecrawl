# Link with Invoicing

## Speed up invoice payments by using Link with the Hosted Invoice Page.

Use [Link](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link) with the [Hosted Invoice
Page](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/hosted-invoice-page) to let your
customers pay invoices faster. Stripe assigns all invoices a unique URL that you
can send to your customer. We host these invoices, which means you can securely
collect payments without any extra implementation code. Link is compatible with
both the [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices) and
[Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions) APIs.

For information about how your payment integration affects Link, see [Link in
different payment
integrations](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/link-payment-integrations).
