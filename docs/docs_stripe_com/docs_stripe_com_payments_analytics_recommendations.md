## Learn more about the Stripe recommendations that can increase revenue and improve fraud detection.

Payments recommendations are suggestions that Stripe makes that can help
increase your revenue or improve fraud protection. View recommendations at
**Payments** > **Analytics** >
[Acceptance](https://dashboard.stripe.com/acceptance) in the Stripe Dashboard.

#### Note

Carefully consider any recommendations. It’s up to your business to analyze and
decide to act on a recommendation. Recommendations don’t constitute professional
advice.

Any estimated impacts such as increases in revenue, are estimates and aren’t
guaranteed. Stripe doesn’t have all the relevant information about your business
to guarantee an outcome. Recommendations might require a tradeoff, such as an
increase in costs, risk of fraud, or additional applicable legal terms.

## Recommendation availability

Recommendations show up in your account when they’re relevant to your business.
We base recommendations on factors such as your account settings and how you
integrate with Stripe. Not all businesses receive the same recommendations.

We base some recommendations on thresholds. For example, if you share data on
some of your payments, but not 80% or more, Stripe might recommend that you
share that data on more of your payments.

Stripe updates recommendations on a daily basis. Natural fluctuations in your
payments could affect a recommendation’s availability as well as its estimated
impact.

## Estimated impact

Each recommendation includes an estimated impact, such as a revenue (otherwise
known as payment volume) increase or fraud model improvement. We show all of
your revenue increases in your settlement currency.

Stripe estimates impact in one of three ways:

- **Based on all payment volume**

Stripe takes your most recent month of payment volume, multiplies it by an
average increase figure, then multiplies it by 12 to provide an annual estimate.

We base the average increase on the increase experienced by other businesses
that took the action we’re recommending. Stripe regularly runs tests to evaluate
this estimated impact. When annualizing the impact, we assume there’s no changes
to your payment volume over time.
- **Based on relevant payment volume**

Stripe takes your most recent month of relevant payment volume, multiplies this
by an average increase figure, then multiplies it by 12 to provide an annual
estimate. Stripe excludes payments that aren’t relevant for the recommendation.

For example, in the card account updater recommendation, we exclude payments
using cards that don’t have an available update.
- **Not based on payment volume**

Stripe doesn’t use your payment volume in the impact estimate, and only looks at
the average that we observe. For example, this could include an improvement to
fraud modeling or conversion rate.
