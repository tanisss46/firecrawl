You can export data, such as the number of\ninstalls and listing views, for your public app. This data is available in\nDashboard or the Stripe API.\n\nThe Dashboard provides additional tools to help you understand your app’s\nperformance, such as:\n\n- Single-number summaries for the currently selected period- Rate-based reports\n(%): Average for the selected period\n- Non-rate-based reports: Sum for the selected period\n- Badges that summarize the current period with the previous period (if\nsufficient historical data is available)\n- Aggregation using a resolution based on your selected date range- To download\nhigher-resolution data, click **Download CSV**.\n\n![App analytics all charts\ndashboard](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/analytics-overview.646194fb349cbe6ef00b6bdbb83010d4.png)\n\n## Get started\n\n- From the **Developer’s Dashboard > Apps**, select your app.\n- Click the **Users** tab, then click **Export app analytics**.\n- Choose the report to export and select your preferred date range.\n\n## Available reports\n\nThe following reports are available to export as a CSV.\n\nNameDescriptionReport typeApp installsInstalls per day`apps.install_events.1`App\nuninstallsUninstalls per day`apps.uninstall_events.1`Cumulative net\ninstallsInstalls to date (`installs - uninstalls`)`apps.total_installs.1`Listing\npage viewsTotal daily app listing views`apps.listing_views.1`Unique listing page\nviewsTotal unique merchants who have visited your app listing\npage`apps.unique_listing_views.1`MoM install conversion rate`# of new installs\nin the last 30 days` ÷ `# of leads in the last 30 days` x\n`100``apps.lead_conversion_rate.1`MoM listing page views growth rate*(`# of\nleads this month` - `# of leads last month`) ÷ `# of leads last month` x\n`100``apps.lead_velocity_rate.1`MoM install churn rate`# of uninstalls in the\nlast 30 days` ÷ `# of active installs 30 days ago` x `100``apps.churn_rate.1`\n***MoM listing page views growth rate** might report high values for early data\npoints. We recommend that you consider data at least 60 days after the first\nnon-null point.\n\n### Data freshness and definitions\n\nThe analytics data lags up to 48 hours before it’s available in reports. If\nyou’re looking for real-time metrics, you can build your own [custom\nanalytics](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/analytics#custom-analytics) using\nour platform primitives.\n\nWe define “leads” as logged-in merchants who visit the marketplace.\n\n### Accessing using the Stripe API\n\nTo access these reports programmatically, you can use the [Reporting\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api/reporting/report_run) to run a report for the\nspecific metrics you want to fetch. Each of the metrics is available as report\ntypes, which you can request in the following way:\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/reporting/report_runs \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d report_type=\"apps.install_events.1\" \\\n -d \"parameters[interval_start]\"=1680000000 \\\n -d \"parameters[interval_end]\"=1680100000\n```\n\n## Users\n\nThe **Users** tab in your app’s details page lists all the currently installed\nusers. If a user reinstalls your app, the `installed` column updates to the most\nrecent install time.\n\n![App users\ntab](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/users_tab_dashboard.f63737de18de2af888119400fed28007.png)\n\n## Custom analytics\n\nIf the provided metrics aren’t sufficient, you can leverage the platform\nprimitives of Stripe to build your own set of metrics using the following\nsolutions:\n\n### Using webhooks\n\nUse webhooks to track and respond to users who install or uninstall your app or\nextension in real time, where you can get insights about:\n\n- Installed user’s account ID- Date and time of install\n- Uninstalled user’s account ID\n- Date and time of uninstall\n- Stripe app users- [Extension\nusers](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/migrate-extension) (if applicable)\n\nFor more information, see how to [receive webhook events from your\napp](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/build-backend#receiving-events-webhooks).\n\n### Using Connect List API\n\nUse the Connect List API to return a list of all the users who’ve currently\ninstalled your app and\n[extension](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/migrate-extension) (if\napplicable).\n\nFor more information, see the [List all connected\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/list) reference.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Developer’s Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/developers)\n- [Apps](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apps)\n- [Reporting API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/reporting/report_run)\n- [Extension users](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/migrate-extension)\n- [receive webhook events from your\napp](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/build-backend#receiving-events-webhooks)\n- [List all connected accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/list)",
