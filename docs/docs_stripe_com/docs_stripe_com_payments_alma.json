You are paid immediately.\n\nAlma is only available for payments between 50 EUR and 5,000 EUR.\n\nPayment method propertiesCountry availability- **Customer locations**\n\nFrance, Italy, Spain, Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg\n- **Presentment currency**\n\nEUR\n- **Payment confirmation**\n\nCustomer-initiated\n- **Payment method family**\n\nBuy Now, pay later\n- **Recurring payments**\n\nNo\n- **Payout timing**\n\nT+3\n- **Connect support**\n\n[Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/alma#connect)\n- **Dispute support**\n\nYes\n- **Manual capture support**\n\nYes\n- **Refunds / Partial refunds**\n\nYes / yes\n\n## Payment flow\n\nBelow is a demonstration of the Alma payment flow from your checkout page:\n\n## Get started\n\nYou don’t have to integrate Alma and other payment methods individually. If you\nuse our front-end products, Stripe automatically determines the most relevant\npayment methods to display. Go to the [Stripe\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and enable\nAlma. To get started with one of our hosted UIs, follow a quickstart:\n\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart): Our prebuilt, hosted\ncheckout page.\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart): Our drop-in UI\ncomponents.\n\n### Other payment products\n\nThe following Stripe products also let you add Alma from the Dashboard:\n\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n\nIf your integration requires manually listing payment methods, learn how to\n[manually configure Alma as a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/alma/accept-a-payment).\n\n## Payment options\n\nDepending on the customer’s billing country and the transaction amount, Alma can\npresent customers with various payment options. Cart ranges and geographic\navailability for payment options are determined by Alma and may change at their\ndiscretion. Regardless of the underlying payment option selected, Stripe makes\nthe full amount of the funds (minus fees) available to you upfront and Alma\ncollects the purchase amount from your customer, who repays Alma directly. These\noptions include:\n\nPay in 2, 3, or 4 (also known as Installments): Customers pay for the purchase\nin two,three or four interest-free payments. The total transaction amount is\ntypically spread equally across the installments, but Alma might occasionally\ncharge your customer more in the first installment based on the customer’s\npurchase power and other credit factors.\n\nThe following table lists the available payment options for supported Alma\nlocations.\n\nPayment optionCurrencyMinimumMaximumPay in 2EUR505,000Pay in 3EUR505,000Pay in\n4EUR505,000\n## Prohibited business categories\n\nIn addition to the industry and business categories listed in [Prohibited and\nrestricted business](https://stripe.com/restricted-businesses), Alma prohibits\nthe following categories:\n\n- Sole proprietorships or individual accounts\n- Business to Business Services\n- Educational services\n- Professional services (including, but not limited to, legal, consulting, and\naccounting)\n- Transportation services\n- Travel services\n- Telecommunication services and utilities\n- Veterinary services\n\nSee a [full list of prohibited\nactivities](https://help.almapay.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360006779359-Which-activities-are-not-eligible-for-payment-with-Alma).\nEven if an activity isn’t listed as prohibited, your business might still be\nineligible for Alma due to risk-related reasons.\n\n## Customer terms\n\nAlma requires that you add the following terms to your general terms of sale:\n\n- Customers can make purchases in installments using Alma.\n- A customer’s purchase using Alma is subject to Alma’s terms and conditions.\n- Non-approval by Alma for a purchase can result in the cancellation of that\npurchase.\n- A customer using Alma to purchase a good or service has a period of 14\ncalendar days in which they can withdraw the purchase.\n\n## Refunds\n\nAlma supports full and partial refunds. The refund period is up to 180 days\nafter the purchase. Refunds for Alma payments are asynchronous and take up to 5\nminutes to complete. We will notify you of the final refund status using the\n`refund.updated` or `refund.failed` [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks)\nevent. When a refund succeeds, the\n[Refund](https://docs.stripe.com/api/refunds/object) object’s status transitions\nto `succeeded`. If a refund fails, the Refund object’s status transitions to\n`failed` and we return the amount to your Stripe balance. You then need to\narrange an alternative way of providing your customer with a refund.\n\n## Disputes\n\nCustomers must authenticate Alma payments by logging into their Alma account.\nThis requirement helps reduce the risk of fraud or unrecognized payments. While\nAlma covers losses incurred from customer fraud, Alma might contact you and\nrequest to stop or pause shipment before incurring any losses. Please comply\npromptly with these requests.\n\nCustomers have up to 120 calendar days from the date of purchase to file a\ndispute. The dispute process works like this:\n\n- After the customer initiates a dispute, Stripe notifies you through email, the\nStripe Dashboard, and an API `charge.dispute.created` event (if your integration\nis set up to receive [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks)).\n- Stripe holds back the disputed amount from your balance until Alma resolves\nthe dispute.\n- Stripe requests that you upload compelling evidence that you fulfilled the\npurchase order [using the Stripe\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/responding#respond). This evidence\ncan include:\n\n- A received return confirmation (for shipped goods returned from the customer\nto you)\n- The tracking ID\n- The shipping date\n- A record of purchase for intangible goods, such as IP address or email receipt\n- A record of purchase for services or physical goods, such as phone number or\nproof of receipt\n- This information helps Alma determine if a dispute is valid or if it should be\nrejected. Make sure the evidence you provide contains as much detail as possible\nfrom what the customer provided at checkout. You must submit the requested\ninformation within 14 calendar days. Alma makes a decision within 25 calendar\ndays of evidence submission. If Alma resolves the dispute with you winning,\nStripe returns the disputed amount to your Stripe balance. If Alma rules in\nfavor of the customer, the balance charge becomes permanent.\n\nIf you prefer to handle disputes programmatically, you can [respond to disputes\nusing the API](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/api).\n\n#### Warning\n\nAlma requires merchants to maintain reasonable fraud and dispute rates.\nIncreases to your fraud and dispute rates might result in losing access to Alma.\n\n## Connect\n\nAlma is available for online marketplaces using [Stripe\nConnect](https://stripe.com/connect). These online marketplaces include\nbusinesses such as Deliveroo and ManoMano that collect payments from customers,\nand later pay out to sub-accounts or service providers. Alma isn’t available for\nplatforms that onboard other businesses and enable them to accept payments\ndirectly, such as Shopify or Squarespace.\n\n#### Note\n\nOnline marketplaces need to submit an onboarding request from the [Stripe\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) to get access\nto Alma. Stripe sends email updates about the progress of all requests, and the\ncurrent status is also reflected on the [Payment methods settings\npage](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods).\n\nThe following [Connect charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges) types,\ntypically used by online marketplaces, are available to businesses using Alma.\n\nDestination chargesSeparate charges and transfersDirect charges`on_behalf_of`\n## Supported currencies\n\nYou can create Alma payments in the currencies that map to your country.
