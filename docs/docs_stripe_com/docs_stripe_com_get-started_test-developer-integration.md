# Build and test new features

## Build and test new features using the Stripe developer tools.

Use the Stripe developer tools to integrate new features without interrupting
your business operations or compromising customer data. This guide helps you:

- Test changes without affecting your live system using
[Sandboxes](https://docs.stripe.com/sandboxes).
- Build and manage your integration with
[Workbench](https://docs.stripe.com/workbench).
- Listen to key activities in your Stripe account to automate business processes
with [event destinations](https://docs.stripe.com/event-destinations).

Imagine you’re a developer at Kavholm, a furniture company ready to introduce a
[new payment
method](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/integration-options).
This payment method aims to position Kavholm as a market leader and improve
customer satisfaction.

## Test with Sandboxes

As you prepare to launch Kavholm’s new payment method, [set up a
sandbox](https://docs.stripe.com/sandboxes/dashboard/manage#create-a-sandbox)
for thorough testing and monitoring. This isolated environment lets you test
features with Stripe functionality without affecting your live system. You can
create multiple sandboxes without affecting other users on your account,
allowing you to manage isolated environments for development and continuous
integration tests. Additionally, you can:

- **Simulate payment scenarios**: Experiment with payment processes related to
the new payment method without making actual transactions. Any settings you
configure in your sandbox remain isolated to the testing environment and don’t
impact your live account.
- **Choose a sandbox configuration**: Set up a pre-configured sandbox that
mirrors some settings of your live account for realistic testing, or select a
blank configuration to explore new settings. Learn more about [sandbox
settings](https://docs.stripe.com/sandboxes/dashboard/sandbox-settings).

### Develop in a sandbox

To develop in a sandbox, consider using these features among other available
options that might benefit your use case:

- **Team-based sandboxes**: Assign dedicated sandboxes for development teams to
focus on specific areas of the payment method integration without interference.
- **Test APIs and webhooks**: Verify integration logic by testing API calls and
webhook responses related to payment method events, such as
`payment_intent.succeeded`.

### Collaborate with external partners

To collaborate with external partners, such as vendors, assign them the [sandbox
user
role](https://docs.stripe.com/sandboxes/dashboard/manage-access#manage-access)
to provide controlled access for testing, ensuring that live data security isn’t
compromised. This role is ideal for external partners and vendors, such as
development agencies.

### Debugging and validation

To debug and validate your integration, use the following features:

- **Troubleshoot and fix bugs**: Debug payment method workflow issues by testing
API calls or integration logic changes in the sandbox.
- **API key management**: Configure API keys for secure requests in the sandbox,
avoiding key-related errors.

### Dedicated sandboxes

By organizing dedicated sandboxes for each testing scenario, you can simulate
real-world conditions, monitor functionality, and debug integration issues
without risking live operations.

For example, you can test all of the payment method functionality before it goes
live, monitor integration performance continuously, and implement changes that
you’ve vetted in an equivalent testing environment.

To get started, create a sandbox by navigating to the account picker menu in the
Stripe Dashboard and selecting the **Create** button. Each sandbox must have a
name and can copy settings from the live account to mirror actual conditions.

With dedicated sandboxes, you can test new features, such as the new payment
method, through various stages such as development, integration testing, and
user acceptance testing (UAT). This ensures that each stage receives thorough
checks without impacting the production environment.

## Build and manage your integration with Workbench

You can debug and manage your Stripe integration from your browser using
Workbench directly in the
[Dashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/workbench#get-started).

Use the following views to manage the payment method feature:

- **Overview**:

- Make sure the new payment method uses the latest and most secure API version.
- Monitor API requests for payment method fee calculations to confirm they
function as expected.
- Identify integration errors related to the payment method.
- **Errors**:

- Identify and categorize errors in payment method calculations or payment
processing.
- Track error frequency to understand impact and urgency.
- **Inspector**:

- Analyze API object configurations and troubleshoot issues in real-time.
- **Logs**:

- Filter API requests to make sure interactions align with expectations.
- **Events**:

- Filter events to verify logistical triggers.
- Review event payloads to confirm correct back-end processing.
- **Webhooks**:

- Set up webhook endpoints or other destination types, such as Amazon
EventBridge, for real-time updates on payment method status and payment
confirmations.
- **Shell and API Explorer**:

- Simulate API requests and manage them using a command-line interface.

## Listen to real-time updates with event destinations

At Kavholm, use event destinations to make sure all payment method features
function as intended without affecting your live systems. Use event destinations
to track real-time activities in your Stripe account, and to respond to critical
events such as payment confirmations or subscription updates. You can:

- Send events to AWS through [Amazon
EventBridge](https://docs.stripe.com/event-destinations/eventbridge) or to an
[HTTPS endpoint through webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks).
- Access real-time data using [thin or snapshot
events](https://docs.stripe.com/event-destinations#events-overview).

### Testing

To simulate real-world conditions and evaluate the payment method’s performance
before it goes live:

- Test the payment method feature in a sandbox by simulating Stripe-generated
events.
- Set up test webhooks to observe event processing without impacting live
customers.

### React to real-time updates

To track key events and maintain oversight of the payment method feature’s
ongoing functionality:

- Configure event destinations to [aggregate and alert you on
events](https://docs.stripe.com/event-destinations#event-permissions) such as
`payment_intent.succeeded`. Event destinations support receiving alerts at a
webhook endpoint or Amazon EventBridge.
- View payment event history to troubleshoot payment method processes and [track
event deliveries](https://docs.stripe.com/event-destinations#event-retention).
Use logs for debugging, especially when your focus is on event logs rather than
API request logs.

### Debugging

To identify and resolve issues through real-time event analysis and ensure
uninterrupted service for Kavholm’s customers:

- Quickly identify billing or payment method issues to alert your customers with
specific event notifications.
- Use [thin events for real-time
analysis](https://docs.stripe.com/event-destinations#prevent-application-errors)
of payment method processing.

With event destinations, Kavholm tests, monitors, and debugs its new payment
method while minimizing disruptions.
