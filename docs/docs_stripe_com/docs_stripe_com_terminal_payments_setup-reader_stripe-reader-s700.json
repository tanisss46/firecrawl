You can customize the on-reader checkout UI using a suite of pre-built and\ncustom elements.\n\nThe [Stripe Terminal SDK connects to the\nreader](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/connect-reader?reader-type=internet)\nover the internet, LAN, or [handoff\nmode](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/apps-on-devices/build#discover-and-connect-a-reader).\n\nThis reader is compatible with the following integrations:\n\n- JavaScript SDK\n- iOS SDK\n- Android SDK\n- React Native SDK\n- Server-driven\n\nFor Stripe Reader S700, we recommend the [server-driven\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/setup-integration?terminal-sdk-platform=server-driven),\nwhich uses the Stripe API instead of a Terminal SDK. To view the reader’s parts\nand features, see the [Stripe Reader S700 product\nsheet](https://d37ugbyn3rpeym.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/s700_product_sheet.612cfab6b7effea90f2164ba79898a0165675e951faa3378068646c8c8bbc0ee.pdf).\n\n## Turn the reader on and off\n\nConnect the reader to power by plugging the provided USB-C cable into the port\non the left side of your reader. Connect the opposite end of the USB-C cable to\nthe provided power adapter and plug it into a power outlet. The Stripe Reader\nS700 requires a recommended 12W of power to operate properly. Stripe power\nadapters and cables are recommended for the charging and operation of the S700\nand its accessories. Using alternative power adapters or cables might result in\nfailure modes including inadequate S700 charging, and might invalidate your\nproduct warranty.\n\n![Side of Stripe Reader\nS700](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/s700-side-view.66affe17a0aeac5999a561f44d67bfbc.png)\n\nStripe Reader S700\n\nAfter the reader is fully charged, hold down the power button on the right side\nuntil the screen turns on. After the device powers on, press the power button to\nsleep or wake the device. To fully power off the device, hold down the power\nbutton until the power off option appears on the screen, then select it.\n\nIn a countertop deployment, leaving the device on for extended periods is\nexpected. With a full charge, you can expect the battery to last about 15 hours.\n\nEven when not in use, leave Stripe Reader S700 plugged in and powered on to\nreceive automatic software updates.\n\n## Access settings\n\nTo open the settings menu, swipe right from the left edge of the reader screen\nto reveal a **Settings** button. Tap the **Settings** button and enter the admin\nPIN `07139`. From here, you can update your WiFi settings or generate a pairing\ncode for device registration. Battery status is displayed at the top right of\nthis screen. To close the settings menu, click the back arrow in the top left\ncorner.\n\n!\n\nSettings button\n\n!\n\nAdmin PIN screen\n\n!\n\nSettings menu\n\n## Screen timeout\n\nThe screen times out when the reader isn’t connected to a power source. The\ndefault timeout of 1 hour improves battery performance. To update this value, go\nto the\n[settings](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/setup-reader/stripe-reader-s700#settings),\nselect **Appearance**, then select a new screen timeout from the dropdown. The\ndevice screen turns on automatically after a device interaction occurs (such as\ntouching the screen or picking up the device), or when the device enters the\npayments flow and a payment is initiated.\n\n!\n\nSettings menu\n\n!\n\nAppearance menu\n\n!\n\nTimeout menu\n\n## Connect the reader to the internet\n\nBecause the Stripe Reader S700 is a smart reader, its reader software\ncommunicates directly with Stripe. Your point of sale application communicates\nwith the reader through either a LAN (using a Terminal SDK) or the internet\n(using the [server-driven\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/setup-integration?terminal-sdk-platform=server-driven)).\nWhen communicating with the reader through the LAN, the reader must connect to\nthe same local network as your point of sale application. If you’re running into\nissues connecting your reader to the internet, follow the [troubleshooting\nsteps](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/readers/stripe-reader-s700#troubleshooting)\nto diagnose the issue.\n\n### WiFi\n\nTo connect to WiFi or switch networks, go to\n[settings](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/setup-reader/stripe-reader-s700#settings),\nthen select **WiFi settings** to choose the network and connect. Attempting to\njoin a new network disconnects the reader from any existing wireless connection.\nLearn more about our [network\nrequirements](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/network-requirements) and how to\n[configure advanced network\nsettings](https://support.stripe.com/questions/bbpos-wisepos-e-stripe-reader-s700-advanced-network-settings)\nfor supported WiFi networks.\n\n### Ethernet and USB Peripherals\n\nEthernet connectivity requires an optional hub, which provides wired 10/100\nEthernet connectivity and allows your smart reader to remain fully charged with\nthe included charging cable. The hub also provides two USB-A ports to connect\nperipherals such as a barcode scanner and printer. The hub is compatible with\nthe S700 Dock for countertop applications. You can purchase the hub and dock\nseparately in the [Stripe\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/terminal/shop).\n\nTo set up the hub:\n\n- Connect the Ethernet cable from your hub to your router.\n- Connect the hub to power through the built-in USB-C cable. We recommend using\nthe power adapter included with your tripe Reader S700 to make sure the\nappropriate power is provided to the hub (27W) to power the reader and attached\nperipherals.\n- Connect the USB-C cable (provided with Stripe Reader S700) to the hub and\nreader when both cables are in place. The right-angle USB-C connector connects\nto the reader.\n\nTo confirm the reader’s Ethernet connectivity, verify that the reader is\ncharging and check if the Ethernet icon is visible in the status bar.\n\nCharging icon\n\nEthernet icon\n\nThe reader obtains an IP address using DHCP. As soon as the network cable is\nplugged in, the reader attempts to establish communication with Stripe.\n\n!\n\nHub when used with Dock (sold separately)\n\n!\n\nHub with peripherals. Ethernet connected and power connected to Stripe Reader\nS700.\n\nFor more information about these accessories, see [Stripe Reader S700\naccessories](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/stripe-reader-s700/accessories).\n\n## Network priority\n\nThe Stripe Reader S700 prioritizes connecting through Ethernet if possible. Even\nif previously configured for WiFi, the reader switches to using an Ethernet\nconnection when connected to the dock with a plugged-in Ethernet cable. If you\nremove the reader from the dock, it switches back to the WiFi connection.\n\nIf you dock the reader, but you don’t have an Ethernet cable plugged in, it uses\nWiFi. Regardless of connectivity while docked, you can still connect to WiFi and\nmanage networks on the device.\n\n## Change the UI appearance\n\nBy default, the user interface of your Stripe Reader S700 reader uses a light\ntheme.\n\nWelcome screen\n\nPayment screen\n\nProcessing screen\n\nApproved screen\n\nYou can change the appearance of the UI to use a different theme in the settings\nmenu. Go to\n[settings](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/setup-reader/stripe-reader-s700#settings),\nthen select **Appearance**, and select a new theme from the dropdown.\n\n!\n\nSettings menu\n\n!\n\nAppearance menu\n\n!\n\nTheme menu\n\n## Change the default reader language\n\nStripe Reader S700 supports changing the reader language in the [reader\nsettings](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/setup-reader/stripe-reader-s700#access-settings)\nmenu. Swipe right across the screen to access the settings menu, and select your\nlanguage.\n\n## Design your own accessories\n\nYou can design your own accessories for the Stripe Reader S700.
