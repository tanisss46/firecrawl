This enables you to:\n\n- Prompt buyers for\n[consent](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web&ui=elements#save-payment-methods)\nto save payment methods, such as `card`, `us_bank_account`, and `sepa_debit`.\n- Save payment methods when buyers provide GDPR-compliant consent for both\none-time payments and recurring transactions.\n- Display saved payment methods to buyers for future purchases. Customers can\nalso remove and update their payment information.\n- Configure the Payment Element to require CVC re-collection for a given\ntransaction.\n\nTo integrate saved payment methods on the Payment Element, first learn to\n[Design an\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element/design-an-integration)\nif you’re new to using the Payment Element. If you have an existing Payment\nElement integration, look for the **Save and retrieve customer payment methods**\nstep in the integration guide you followed to enable saved payment methods.\n\n## Use saved payment methods with Link\n\n[Link](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link) is a network of saved payment\nmethods that work across all Stripe users. You can use Link with Saved Payment\nMethods without any additional configuration.\n\n- New customers can save their payment method to a specific business, Link, or\nboth.\n- Customers who have both a saved Link payment method and a saved business\npayment method see their business saved payment method displayed after the page\nloads.\n\n![The Payment Element with Link and a saved payment method\ncheckbox](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/spm-with-link.6bdc33f8d987d2183ded4ebf69e7a43d.png)\n\nSave payment methods with Link.\n\n![The Payment Element with a Saved payment method\nselected](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/spm-with-link-saved.d0bcd4ea872fd4123209aab8b28fc1ee.png)\n\nReuse a previously saved payment method.\n\n## Re-collect payment details\n\nFor additional security, you can specify\n[require_cvc_recollection](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-payment_method_options-card-require_cvc_recollection)\nto request the Payment Element to re-collect a CVC when a customer is paying\nwith a card.\n\n```\npayment_method_options: {\n card: {required_cvc_recollection: true}\n}\n```\n\n## Save a payment method for a subscription or recurring transaction\n\nIf the **Save payment details for future purchases** checkbox appears and is\nselected when you’re confirming a payment, the payment method’s\n[allow_redisplay](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object#payment_method_object-allow_redisplay)\nvalue is set to `always`. This means the customer consents to use the payment\nmethod for the subscription and future sessions. If the customer leaves the\ncheckbox unselected, the `allow_redisplay` value is set to `limited`. This means\nyou can’t use the payment method for future purchases — it’s limited to the\ncurrent subscription you’re setting up.\n\n## Prevent payment method removal from subscriptions\n\nIf a payment method is saved for reuse and is also the payment method for an\nongoing subscription, removing that payment method from the Payment Element’s\n**Saved** section also removes it from the subscription. We recommend that you\n[disable\nremoving](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_sessions/object#customer_session_object-components-payment_element-features-payment_method_remove)\nsaved payment methods from the Payment Element to avoid removing a payment\nmethod from an active subscription. Instead, manage payment methods in an\naccount settings or similar page that shows existing subscriptions.\n\n## Display existing saved payment methods\n\nIf existing payment methods are attached to customers in your Stripe account\nfrom a Card Element integration, direct use of the Stripe API, or some other\nmethod, those payment methods won’t render in the Payment Element as their\n`allow_redisplay` property is `unspecified`. If the `allow_redisplay` property\nis `always`, the payment method renders in the Payment Element.\n\nYou can use one of the following methods to display previously saved payment\nmethods:\n\n- If you collected the proper consent from the customer when saving the payment\nmethod, update `allow_redisplay` to `always`.- Use the [Payment Method update\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/update) to update an individual\npayment method.\n- Configure the [Customer Session\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_sessions/object#customer_session_object-components-payment_element-features-payment_method_allow_redisplay_filters)\nto include payment methods where `allow_redisplay=\"unspecified\"`.\n\n## Collect consent to reuse a payment method outside of the Payment Element\n\nThe Payment Element uses the state of the **Save payment details for future\npurchases** checkbox to determine when a customer has given consent to save a\npayment method. If you’re collecting this consent a different way (such as with\nthe terms and conditions of your website or consent text rendered outside of the\nPayment Element), you can override the consent that the Elements instance\nprovides when confirming the intent.\n\nIf your integration uses\n[stripe.confirmPayment](https://docs.stripe.com/js/payment_intents/confirm_payment),\n[stripe.confirmSetup](https://docs.stripe.com/js/setup_intents/confirm_setup),\nor\n[stripe.createConfirmationToken](https://docs.stripe.com/js/confirmation_tokens/create_confirmation_token),\npass an explicit\n[allow_redisplay](https://docs.stripe.com/js/payment_intents/confirm_payment#confirm_payment_intent-options-confirmParams-payment_method_data-allow_redisplay)\nvalue into the options hash to override the value from the Elements instance.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Customer object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers)\n-\n[consent](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web&ui=elements#save-payment-methods)\n- [Design an\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element/design-an-integration)\n- [Link](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link)\n-\n[require_cvc_recollection](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-payment_method_options-card-require_cvc_recollection)\n-\n[allow_redisplay](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object#payment_method_object-allow_redisplay)\n- [disable\nremoving](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_sessions/object#customer_session_object-components-payment_element-features-payment_method_remove)\n- [Payment Method update\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/update)\n- [Customer Session\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_sessions/object#customer_session_object-components-payment_element-features-payment_method_allow_redisplay_filters)\n-\n[stripe.confirmPayment](https://docs.stripe.com/js/payment_intents/confirm_payment)\n- [stripe.confirmSetup](https://docs.stripe.com/js/setup_intents/confirm_setup)\n-\n[stripe.createConfirmationToken](https://docs.stripe.com/js/confirmation_tokens/create_confirmation_token)\n-\n[allow_redisplay](https://docs.stripe.com/js/payment_intents/confirm_payment#confirm_payment_intent-options-confirmParams-payment_method_data-allow_redisplay)",
