Checkout Sessions that don’t create Customers are\nassociated with guest customers instead. Stripe automatically groups [guest\ncustomers in the Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/customers?type=guest)\nbased on them having used the same card, email, or phone to make payments. This\nunified view helps you review purchasing behavior, refunds, chargebacks, or\nfraud.\n\nCheckout supports passing in a\n[customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-customer)\nto enable you to [prefill customer\ninformation](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/existing-customers?platform=web&ui=stripe-hosted)\non the Checkout page and to associate the payment or subscription with a\nspecific customer.\n\nIf you don’t pass in a `customer`, you can set\n[customer_creation](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-customer_creation)\nto configure whether or not Checkout automatically creates a Customer object\nwhen the session is confirmed.\n\n## Managing and monitoring guest customers\n\nEven though you can’t manage or monitor guest customers in the same way as with\nCheckout Sessions that create Customers, you can still manage them and monitor\ntheir activity.\n\n### Grouping payments under guest customers\n\nWe use credit card number as the unique identifier to group credit card payments\nof your guest customers under the same guest identity. See the [guest customer\nsupport page](https://support.stripe.com/questions/guest-customer-faq) for\nadditional details on the matching logic. If the same credit card was used by\ndifferent guest customers (for example, two spouses using the same credit card\nto checkout at different times), all guest payments for that credit card show up\ntogether under one guest customer. Because we group by credit card, we consider\nit the same guest customer.\n\n### Updating your privacy policy or other privacy notices\n\nYou’re in the best position to know whether this feature is consistent with your\nprivacy policy or other privacy notices. It’s a good practice to review your\nprivacy notices and privacy policy when considering any new feature. Guest\ncustomers give you a view of your existing guest data, which can help you better\ndetect fraud and help you manage customer service inquiries.\n\n### Exporting guest customer data from the Dashboard\n\nYou can export guest customer data from the\n[Customers](https://dashboard.stripe.com/customers) tab in the Dashboard. Guest\ncustomer information isn’t included in exports from the\n[Payments](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments) tab.\n\n### Not seeing any guest customers in the Guests tab\n\nIf you don’t see any guest customers under the **Guests** tab, this is because\nyour Stripe integration is passing a Customer ID when creating Checkout\nSessions. We only create guest customers for payments without a specific\nCustomer object associated with them.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Customer object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers)\n- [guest customers in the\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/customers?type=guest)\n-\n[customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-customer)\n- [prefill customer\ninformation](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/existing-customers?platform=web&ui=stripe-hosted)\n-\n[customer_creation](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-customer_creation)\n- [guest customer support\npage](https://support.stripe.com/questions/guest-customer-faq)\n- [Customers](https://dashboard.stripe.com/customers)\n- [Payments](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments)",
