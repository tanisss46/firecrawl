# Customers now provide a tax_info object with their tax ID detailsBreaking changes

## What’s new

In both requests and responses, changes the
[Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers) object `business_vat_id`
attribute from a string to hash called `tax_info`, consisting of `tax_id` and
`type`.

## Impact

This change restructures the customer’s VAT information from a simple string to
a more detailed hash structure. You can now provide and access more
comprehensive tax information, including both the tax ID and its type. This
modification requires updates to code that creates, updates, or retrieves
customer tax information.
