If\nyou use our front-end products, Stripe automatically determines the most\nrelevant payment methods to display. Go to the [Stripe\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and enable\nScalapay. To get started with one of our hosted UIs, follow a quickstart:\n\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart): Our prebuilt, hosted\ncheckout page.\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart): Our drop-in UI\ncomponents.\n\n### Other payment products\n\nThe following Stripe products also let you add Scalapay from the Dashboard:\n\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n\nIf your integration requires manually listing payment methods, learn how to\n[manually configure Scalapay as a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/scalapay/accept-a-payment).\n\n## Payment options\n\nThe minimum charge limit is 5.00 EUR.\n\nThe maximum charge limit is 4,999.99 EUR.\n\n## Prohibited and restricted business categories\n\nIn addition to the categories of goods or services sold and businesses\n[restricted from using Stripe\noverall](https://stripe.com/restricted-businesses), the following categories are\nprohibited from using Scalapay:\n\n- Agricultural Cooperative\n- Direct Marketing - Outbound Telemarketing\n- Duty Free Stores\n- Government-Owned Lotteries (US Region only)\n- Intra-Company Purchases\n- Non-FI, Stored Value Card Purchase/Load\n- Political Organizations\n- Quick , Repro, and Blueprint\n- Tailors, Alterations\n- Tolls/Bridge Fees\n- Other categories at the discretion of Scalapay\n\n## Disputes\n\nScalapay has a claims process that allows transaction disputes. Customers can\nopen disputes for cases of suspected fraud, double payments, or a difference\nbetween an order and a transaction amount.\n\nAfter the customer initiates a dispute, Stripe notifies you using:\n\n- Email\n- The Stripe Dashboard\n- An API `charge.dispute.created` event (if your integration is set up to\nreceive [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks))\n\nStripe holds back the disputed amount from your balance until Scalapay resolves\nthe dispute.\n\nWe request that you upload compelling evidence proving that you fulfilled the\npurchase order [using the Stripe\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/responding#respond). This evidence\ncan include the:\n\n- Tracking ID\n- Shipping date\n- Record of purchase for intangible goods, such as IP address or email receipt\n- Record of purchase for services or physical goods, such as phone number or\nproof of receipt\n- Record of refund (for purchase you’ve already refunded)\n\nTo handle disputes programmatically, [respond to disputes using the\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/api).\n\nThis information helps Scalapay determine if a dispute is valid. Make sure the\nevidence you provide contains as much detail as possible from what the customer\nprovided at checkout. You must submit the requested information within 12\ncalendar days. If Scalapay resolves the dispute with you winning, we return the\ndisputed amount to your Stripe balance. If Scalapay rules in favor of the\ncustomer, the balance charge becomes permanent.\n\n## Refunds\n\nScalapay supports full and partial refunds. The refund period is up to 180 days\nafter the purchase. Refunds for Scalapay payments are asynchronous and take up\nto 5 minutes to complete. Stripe notifies you of the final refund status using\nthe `refund.updated` or `refund.failed`\n[webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) event. When a refund succeeds, the\n[Refund](https://docs.stripe.com/api/refunds/object) object’s status transitions\nto `succeeded`. If a refund fails, the `Refund` object’s status transitions to\n`failed` and we return the amount to your Stripe balance. You’ll then need to\narrange an alternative way of providing your customer with a refund.\n\n## Connect\n\nIf you use [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect), you must consider the\nfollowing before you enable and use Scalapay.\n\n### Request Scalapay capabilities for your connected accounts\n\nSet the `scalapay_payments` capability to `active` on your platform account, and\non any connected accounts you want to enable Scalapay for. You can also [request\nmore account\ncapabilities](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities#requesting-unrequesting).\n\n### Merchant of record and statement descriptors\n\nThe [charge type](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges) of Connect payments\nmight change the default statement descriptor and the merchant name that appears\non the customer’s banking application and confirmation emails.\n\nCharge typeDescriptor taken fromDirectConnected\naccountDestinationPlatformSeparate charge and transferPlatformDestination (with\n`on_behalf_of`)Connected accountSeparate charge and transfer (with\n`on_behalf_of`)Connected account\n## Supported currencies\n\nYou can create Scalapay payments in the currencies that map to your country.
