If you’re a\nfirst-time user, Stripe automatically enables card,\n[Link](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link), bank transfers, Cash App Pay, and\nWeChat Pay payment methods. To enable additional payment methods, you need to\nactivate them in your [Payment methods\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods).\n\nIn some situations, restrictions might prevent payment methods from being used\nfor an invoice. For instance, a payment method might only operate in one\ncurrency, or have limitations on the amount that can be paid. Stripe doesn’t\nautomatically select a payment method when these limitations prevent it from\nbeing used. To learn more, read about [supported payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/payment-methods#supported).\n\n![Choose additional payment\nmethods](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/supported-payment-methods.949a2d41b8da98f93ad94c95c986e75c.png)\n\nChoose additional payment methods\n\n[How to get paid](https://docs.stripe.com/no-code/invoices#get-paid)\nYou can [create and send](https://dashboard.stripe.com/invoices/create) an\ninvoice from the Dashboard.

Set a default memo, footer, and numbering\nscheme. Determine your default payment terms. Because you know more about your\ncustomers and your business than Stripe does, make sure your invoices include\nall of the required information.
