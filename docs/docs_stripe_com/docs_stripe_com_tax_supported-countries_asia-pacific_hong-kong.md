# Collect tax from Hong Kong

## Learn how to use Stripe Tax to calculate, collect, and report tax from Hong Kong.

## When to register for tax collection

Hong Kong doesn’t impose VAT or sales tax. This means you won’t see an option to
add your registration for Hong Kong to Stripe and collect taxes from your
customers based in Hong Kong.

However Hong Kong does impose other taxes on businesses, including a profits
tax. Learn more about the taxes that apply in Hong Kong at the [tax
authority](https://www.gov.hk/en/business/taxes/profittax/index.htm).

If you’re a business based in Hong Kong you could still have tax obligations
based on sales to customers in other locations. See
[Thresholds](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/thresholds) to get insights about
your potential tax registration obligations. Stripe also notifies you with email
and Dashboard alerts when you need to register to collect tax. Learn more about
how the [monitoring tool works](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/monitoring).

## Register to collect tax

You may need to register to collect tax on your sales in other countries. Learn
more in our guides about:

- [Registering for sales tax in the United
States](https://stripe.com/guides/sales-tax-registration-process-us)
- [Registering for VAT in the European
Union](https://stripe.com/guides/tax-registration-process-europe)

After you’ve registered to collect tax in a location, go to
[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations?location=hk) to
add your registrations to Stripe in the Dashboard. This turns on tax calculation
and collection in Stripe for your transactions in that location.

Learn [how to add your
registration](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/registering#track-your-registrations-in-the-tax-dashboard)
in the Dashboard.

## How we calculate taxes

Generally, most transactions are taxable in the jurisdiction where your customer
is. Stripe assumes the sale of most goods or services to be taxable unless
specifically exempted.

## Report and file your taxes

Stripe provides reports of your completed tax transactions. Go to
[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations) to access these
reports. Learn more about [the different types of
reports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports).

You are responsible for filing and remitting your taxes. Stripe doesn’t file
taxes on your behalf.
