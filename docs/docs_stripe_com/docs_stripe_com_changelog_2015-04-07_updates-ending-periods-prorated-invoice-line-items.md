# Updates how ending periods are calculated on prorated invoice line itemsBreaking changes

## What’s new

Updates the `period[end]` property on proration invoice line items to reflect
the subscription’s `current_period_end` property when the update and proration
was made. A proration invoice line item’s `period[start]` and `period[end]`
properties now represent the prorated adjustment interval. Previously,
`period[end]` marked the time at which the proration was made, and was the same
as `period[start]`.

## Impact

Proration invoice line item period properties now represent prorated adjustment
interval, providing more accurate proration information.
