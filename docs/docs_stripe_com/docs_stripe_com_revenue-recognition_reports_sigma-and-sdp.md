# Custom reports by Sigma and SDP

## Learn how to build your own Revenue Recognition reports using Sigma and SDP.

You can build your customized reports using
`revenue_recognition_debits_and_credits` and other tables in
[Sigma](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data/access-data-in-dashboard).

## Recognized revenue from unpaid invoices example

This sample query generates a report for revenue recognized from the unpaid open
invoices and groups the invoices by invoice ID. You can add your desired time
frames and adjust the grouping parameters.

#### Note

If youâ€™re using our [chart of
accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/chart-of-accounts) beta
feature, be sure to update the `debit` and `credit` mappings in the query below
to reflect the accounts in your general ledger.

```
with revrec as (
 select
 *
 from
 revenue_recognition_debits_and_credits
 where
 debit = 'DeferredRevenue' and credit = 'Revenue'
), sigmainv as (
 select
 *
 from
 invoices
 where
 status = 'open'
)
select
 revrec.invoice_id,
 SUM(revrec.presentment_amount) AS recognized_revenue
from
 sigmainv
 left join revrec on revrec.invoice_id = sigmainv.id
group by revrec.invoice_id
```
