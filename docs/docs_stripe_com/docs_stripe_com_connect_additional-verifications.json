  "content": "# Additional verifications\n\n## Add identity verification checks to your platform’s connected accounts.\n\nCollect additional identity verification from connected\n[accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/accounts) to help reduce fraud\nlosses, streamline risk operations, and meet additional compliance requirements.\nAutomatically collect required information with [Connect\nOnboarding](https://stripe.com/connect/onboarding) or embed [Stripe\nIdentity](https://docs.stripe.com/identity) as part of your custom onboarding\nexperience. Restrict your flow of funds based on verification status and volume\nthresholds.\n\nBy adding a few lines of code to your [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)\nintegration, you can:\n\n- Request an ID document check during initial onboarding\n- Match the ID photo with selfies of the document holder\n- Disable [payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts) or payments based on\nverification status or volume thresholds\n- Access captured images and data extracted from ID documents\n- Receive detailed status updates and error messages\n\nCommon use cases for additional verifications\n\n- **Reduce fraud losses**: For example, platforms can streamline risk processes\nby requiring an ID verification before enabling the first payout.\n- **Increase trust & safety**: For example, marketplaces facilitating in-person\nservices can require ID verification before allowing connected accounts to\ncollect payments or interact with other users.\n- **Meet additional compliance requirements**: For example, platforms can\nconduct ID verification to confirm the user’s identity to help meet their own\nKYC requirements.\n\n## Get started Invite only\n\nAccess to additional verifications is currently by invitation only. If you’re\ninterested in this functionality, [reach out to\nsales](https://stripe.com/contact/sales) for an invitation.\n\n## Links\n\n- [accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/accounts)\n- [Connect Onboarding](https://stripe.com/connect/onboarding)\n- [Stripe Identity](https://docs.stripe.com/identity)\n- [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)\n- [payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts)\n- [reach out to sales](https://stripe.com/contact/sales)",
