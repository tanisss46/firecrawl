  "content": "# Configure tax form settings\n\n## Learn about the settings you can configure for the 1099 forms you send to connected accounts.\n\n#### Getting your 1099 Forms\n\nIf you work for a platform that pays you via Stripe and want to learn about your\n1099 forms and how to get them, see [1099 tax\nforms](https://support.stripe.com/express/topics/1099-tax-forms) on the Stripe\nSupport site.\n\nUse the [Stripe\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/tax-reporting/1099-forms)\nto configure the settings for the 1099 forms you send to connected accounts. You\ncan change almost all tax settings for forms you haven’t filed yet. For example,\nif you initially set your tax form to report non-employee compensation using\n1099-NEC and later determine you need to report payment transactions using\n1099-K, you can change the default form type and automatically update all forms.\n\nIf a user with the administrator role configured the tax form default settings\nin the onboarding flow for 1099 tax reporting, you can assign the [Tax\nAnalyst](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/teams) role to a team\nmember on your account to allow that person full access to features in the [Tax\nreporting](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/taxes/forms) view.\n\n## Common settings\n\nThese settings apply to all tax forms.\n\nDefault form typeSets the default type of 1099 form to use to report\ncompensation or payment transactions. If you need to deliver multiple form\ntypes, you can [change the type of 1099\nform](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/modify-tax-forms?method=csv#change-the-type-of-1099-form)\nfor an account.Payer tax identityUses the platform account’s information (legal\nbusiness name and tax identification number) by default. You can change your\npayer tax identity if, for example, you want the legal entity on the 1099 form\nto differ from the legal entity associated with your Stripe account.Payer\naddressUses the platform account’s information by default. This address displays\non the 1099-NEC or 1099-MISC form as the Payer’s address and on the 1099-K form\nas the Filer’s address.Payer phone numberUses the platform account’s information\nby default. This phone number displays on tax forms as the Payer’s or Filer’s\nphone number.Payer state registrationsAdd corresponding state tax registration\nor withholding ID when it is required for the states in which you’ll file.\n## Delivery method settings\n\nConfigure settings for how to deliver your 1099 forms to payees. These settings\napply to all 1099 form types.\n\nDelivery strategyConfigures the default delivery strategy to use, either smart\ndelivery settings or customize delivery settings.E-deliverySpecifies whether to\ne-deliver forms using an interface built by Stripe, including [Stripe Embedded\nComponents](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components),\nthe [Stripe Express\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/express-dashboard), and the [Stripe\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/stripe-dashboard). If enabled, all\naccounts with a viable email address receive an email when their 1099 form is\navailable, except in [some rare\nsituations](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/express-dashboard-taxes#which-accounts-get-access-to-e-delivery).\nIf an account has given e-delivery consent, they can access their form\nimmediately. If delivery is through the Stripe Express Dashboard and the\nconnected previously didn’t have access to it, they must claim their Stripe\nExpress account before they can access their form.Postal deliverySpecifies\nwhether to deliver printed copies of 1099 forms via postal mail using the\nplatform’s US return mailing address.\n**Postal Delivery Options**\n\nDisable Postal DeliveryConnected accounts don’t receive tax forms by postal\nmail.Optional Postal DeliveryStripe sends printed tax forms through postal mail\nto every connected account that hasn’t consented to e-delivery at the time of\nfiling, or is ineligible to receive e-delivery. If you enabled e-delivery\nthrough an interface built by Stripe, connected accounts can also request a\npaper copy of their tax form through their respective interface.Postal\ndeliveryAll connected accounts receive tax forms by postal mail.\n## 1099-K settings\n\nConfigure these settings for the\n[1099-K](https://support.stripe.com/questions/intro-to-1099-k-tax-forms-for-platforms-and-marketplaces)\nforms you send to connected accounts.\n\nDefault calculation methodConfigures the default [calculation\nmethod](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/calculation-methods) to use, either\npayments that include fees or payments that exclude fees.Filer typeSpecifies if\nthe platform account is a payment settlement entity (PSE) or an electronic\npayment facilitator (EPF).Payment settlement entityAppears if the filer type is\nEPF. If so, you must specify the name and phone number for the PSE.Transactions\nreportedConfigures the type of transaction that’s processed.\n## 1099-MISC settings\n\nConfigure these settings for the\n[1099-MISC](https://support.stripe.com/questions/intro-to-1099-misc-tax-forms-for-platforms-and-marketplaces)\nforms you send to connected accounts.\n\nPayments boxPayment amounts are reported in the specified box on the 1099-MISC\nform. For example, choose 3 Other income to display the amount in box number 3.\nYou can use CSV import to override this box for specific tax forms.Default\ncalculation methodConfigures the default [calculation\nmethod](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/calculation-methods) to use. You can\nchoose between payments that include fees, payments that exclude fees, or\npayouts only.\n## 1099-NEC settings\n\nConfigure these settings for your\n[1099-NEC](https://support.stripe.com/questions/intro-to-1099-nec-tax-forms-for-platforms-and-marketplaces)\nforms.\n\nDefault calculation methodConfigures the default [calculation\nmethod](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/calculation-methods) to use.
