  "content": "# Afterpay and Clearpay payments\n\n## Offer your customers flexible financing while getting paid upfront with Afterpay (also known as Clearpay in the UK).\n\nAfterpay is a global payment method that allows your customers to split\npurchases into 4 interest-free installments, or longer term interest-bearing\nmonthly installments (US only).\n\nTo pay with Afterpay, customers are redirected to Afterpay’s site, where they\nauthorize the payment by agreeing to the terms of a payment plan, then return to\nyour website to complete the order. Afterpay offers payment options based on\nfactors such as customer credit, prior account history, order amount, and the\ntype of goods or services being underwritten. After payment acceptance, the full\namount of the order (minus fees) is made available to your Stripe account\nupfront, and Afterpay collects the purchase amount from your customer, who\nrepays Afterpay directly over time. For more information, see [Payment options\nand\nlimits](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/afterpay-clearpay#collection-schedule).\n\nPayment method propertiesBusiness locationsProduct support- **Customer\nlocations**\n\nUnited States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand\n- **Presentment currency**\n\nUSD, CAD, GBP, AUD, or NZD\n- **Payment confirmation**\n\nCustomer-initiated\n- **Payment method family**\n\nBuy now, pay later\n- **Recurring payments**\n\nNo\n- **Payout timing**\n\nStandard payout timing applies\n- **Connect support**\n\nYes\n- **Dispute support**\n\n[Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/afterpay-clearpay#disputed-payments)\n- **Manual capture support**\n\nYes\n- **Refunds / Partial refunds**\n\n[Yes / Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/afterpay-clearpay#refunds)\n\n#### Note\n\nAfterpay and Clearpay only support domestic transactions, meaning you can only\nsell to customers in the same country as your business. If you’re using [Dynamic\npayment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/dynamic-payment-methods),\nStripe handles a customer’s payment method eligibility automatically. If you use\n[payment_method_types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-payment_method_types),\nyou must either configure your integration so that it only presents Afterpay and\nClearpay to eligible customers, or use dynamic payment methods.\n\n## Payment flow\n\nThis demo shows the customer experience when using Afterpay.\n\n## Get started\n\nYou don’t have to integrate Afterpay and other payment methods individually. If\nyou use our front-end products, Stripe automatically determines the most\nrelevant payment methods to display. Go to the [Stripe\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and enable\nAfterpay. To get started with one of our hosted UIs, follow a quickstart:\n\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart): Our prebuilt, hosted\ncheckout page.\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart): Our drop-in UI\ncomponents.\n\n[Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links) also supports adding\nAfterpay from the Dashboard.\n\nIf you prefer to manually list payment methods, learn how to [manually configure\nAfterpay as a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/afterpay-clearpay/accept-a-payment).\n\nYou can also let customers know Afterpay payments are available by including the\n[Payment Method Messaging\nElement](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-method-messaging) on your\nproduct, cart, and payment pages. We recommend adding a site messaging Element\nto help drive conversion.\n\n## Payment options and limits\n\nPayment options vary by cart order size and country. In the US, Afterpay\npresents customers with Pay in 4, monthly installments, or both options. For all\nother markets, Afterpay presents customers with Pay in 4 only.\n\n- **Pay in 4**: customers pay for purchases in four or fewer interest-free,\nbi-weekly payments over a 6 week term.\n- **Monthly installments**: (US only) customers pay for purchases over a 6 or 12\nmonth term that includes capped interest.\n\nAfterpay collects the first installment from the customer immediately, and the\nnext installment either 2 weeks or 1 month after, depending on the payment\nschedule. You can accept payments from customers in the same country that you\nregistered your Stripe account. Payments must also match the local currency of\nthe country.\n\nThe following table lists total transaction limits and installment schedules by\ncountry.\n\nStripe account and customer countryCurrencyTransaction limitsAustraliaAUD1 -\n2,000 AUDCanadaCAD1 - 2,000 CADNew ZealandNZD1 - 2,000 NZDUnited KingdomGBP0.3 -\n1,200 GBPUnited StatesUSD1 - 4,000 USD\n### United States\n\n## Prohibited business categories\n\nIn addition to the categories of [businesses restricted from using Stripe\noverall](https://stripe.com/restricted-businesses), the following categories are\nprohibited from using Afterpay.\n\n- Alcohol\n- Donations\n- Pre-orders\n- NFTs\n- B2B\n\nFor the complete list, see the [terms of\nservice](https://stripe.com/afterpay-clearpay/legal#restricted-businesses).\n\n## Add Afterpay branding to your website\n\nLet your customers know you accept payments with Afterpay by including the\n[Payment Method Messaging\nElement](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-method-messaging) on your\nproduct and cart pages.\n\nAfterpay also provides static [visual assets and branding\nguidance](https://www.afterpay.com/retailer-resources). In AU, CA, NZ and the\nUS, consumers know Afterpay as ‘Afterpay’. In the UK, they know it as\n‘Clearpay’. Make sure you pick the right location (see the footer in the\n[Afterpay documentation](https://www.afterpay.com/retailer-resources)) so that\nyou get the appropriate assets. For Clearpay, see the [UK assets and branding\nguidance](https://www.clearpay.co.uk/en-GB/retailer-resources).\n\n## Disputes\n\nCustomers must authenticate Afterpay payments by logging into their Afterpay\naccount. This requirement helps reduce the risk of fraud or unrecognized\npayments. Afterpay covers losses incurred from customer fraud or the inability\nto repay installments. However, Stripe might contact you on behalf of Afterpay\nand request to stop or pause a shipment before any losses are incurred. It’s\nimportant to comply promptly with these requests.\n\nCustomers can dispute Afterpay payments in certain cases—for example, if they\ndon’t receive the goods they paid for. Customers have up to 120 calendar days\nfrom the date of purchase to file a dispute. The dispute process works like\nthis:\n\nAfter the customer initiates a dispute, Stripe notifies you using:\n\n- Email\n- The Stripe Dashboard\n- An API `charge.dispute.created` event (if your integration is set up to\nreceive [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks))\n\nStripe holds back the disputed amount from your balance until Afterpay resolves\nthe dispute.\n\nStripe requests that you upload compelling evidence that you fulfilled the\npurchase order [using the Stripe\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/responding#respond). This evidence\ncan include:\n\n- A received return confirmation (for shipped goods returned from the customer\nto you)\n- The tracking ID\n- The shipping date\n- A record of purchase for intangible goods, such as IP address or email receipt\n- A record of purchase for services or physical goods, such as phone number or\nproof of receipt\n\nIf you prefer to handle disputes programmatically, you can [respond to disputes\nusing the API](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/api).\n\nThis information helps Afterpay determine if a dispute is valid or if they\nshould reject it. Make sure the evidence you provide contains as much detail as\npossible from what the customer provided at checkout. You must submit the\nrequested information within 14 calendar days. Afterpay makes a decision within\n30 calendar days of evidence submission. If Afterpay resolves the dispute with\nyou winning, Stripe returns the disputed amount to your Stripe balance. If\nAfterpay rules in favor of the customer, the balance charge becomes permanent.\n\n## Refunds\n\nYou can refund Afterpay charges up to 120 days after the original payment.\nRefunds for Afterpay payments are asynchronous.\n\n## Connect\n\nYou can use [Stripe Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/how-connect-works)\nwith Afterpay to process payments on behalf of a connected account.\n[Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect) users can use Afterpay with the\nfollowing charge types:\n\n- [Direct](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges)\n- [Destination](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges)\n- [Separate Charges and\nTransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\nStripe and Afterpay rely on merchant category codes (MCC) to determine\neligibility of the connected accounts against the Afterpay [prohibited business\ncategories](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/afterpay-clearpay#prohibited-business-categories).\nMake sure that you set [correct\nMCCs](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/setting-mcc) for your connected accounts\nthat use the Express Dashboard or a dashboard that isn’t hosted by Stripe.\n\n## Links\n\n- [pricing details](https://stripe.com/pricing/local-payment-methods)\n- [Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/afterpay-clearpay#disputed-payments)\n- [Yes / Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/afterpay-clearpay#refunds)\n- [Dynamic payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/dynamic-payment-methods)\n-\n[payment_method_types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-payment_method_types)\n- [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods)\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart)\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart)\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n- [manually configure Afterpay as a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/afterpay-clearpay/accept-a-payment)\n- [Payment Method Messaging\nElement](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-method-messaging)\n- [businesses restricted from using Stripe\noverall](https://stripe.com/restricted-businesses)\n- [terms of\nservice](https://stripe.com/afterpay-clearpay/legal#restricted-businesses)\n- [visual assets and branding\nguidance](https://www.afterpay.com/retailer-resources)\n- [UK assets and branding\nguidance](https://www.clearpay.co.uk/en-GB/retailer-resources)\n- [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks)\n- [using the Stripe\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/responding#respond)\n- [respond to disputes using the API](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/api)\n- [Stripe Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/how-connect-works)\n- [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)\n- [Direct](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges)\n- [Destination](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges)\n- [Separate Charges and\nTransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n- [correct MCCs](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/setting-mcc)",
