# Collect tax in Iceland

## Learn how to use Stripe Tax to calculate, collect, and report tax in Iceland.

In Iceland, Stripe Tax supports calculation and collection of
[VAT](https://www.skatturinn.is/english/companies/value-added-tax/) for remote
sellers. You must have no physical presence in the country to collect this tax
on Stripe.

## When to register for tax collection

See [Thresholds](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/thresholds) to get insights
about your potential tax registration obligations in Iceland. Stripe also
notifies you with email and Dashboard alerts when you need to register to
collect tax. Learn more about how the [monitoring tool
works](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/monitoring).

Remote sellers must register for VAT if their taxable turnover in Iceland
exceeds 2,000,000 ISK within any 12-month period, and it requires fiscal
representation. Remote sellers who provide electronically supplied services and
subscriptions to physical papers and magazines for Icelandic consumers can use a
simplified registration procedure (VOES) that doesn’t require fiscal
representation. Sales to VAT-registered businesses where the customer pays for
the VAT through the reverse charge mechanism don’t count towards the threshold.

- **Threshold**: 2,000,000 ISK
- **Time period**: 12 months
- **Included transactions**: Any taxable transactions that reverse charge
doesn’t apply to.

## How we calculate taxes

Stripe calculates VAT for your transactions in Iceland.

Generally, most transactions are taxable in the jurisdiction where your customer
is. Stripe assumes the sale of most goods or services to be taxable unless
specifically exempted.

## Report and file your taxes

Stripe Tax has filing partners—Taxually, Marosa, and Hands-off Sales Tax
(HOST)—to help automate your tax filing. These partners automatically sync your
tax transaction data in real time, eliminating the need for manual data entry or
file transfers. Learn more about [tax
filing](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/filing).

Stripe also provides reports of your completed tax transactions. Go to
[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations) to access these
reports. Learn more about [the different types of
reports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports).
