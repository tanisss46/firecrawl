Stripe books separate transfers\nas contra revenue, and transfer reversals cancel out the contra revenue. Revenue\nRecognition doesnâ€™t automatically link [separate charges and\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\nbecause they might not always have a direct connection.\n\nIn this example, `amount=\"1000\"` is set on the separate transfer.\n\n- On January 1, you create a charge of 15 USD.\n- On January 2, you create a transfer of 10 USD.\n- On February 1, you create a refund of 15 USD.\n- On February 2, you create a transfer reversal of 10 USD.\n\nIf you view the summary after February ends, your data might resemble the\nfollowing:\n\nAccountJanFebRevenue+15.00Refund+15.00Transfer+10.00-10.00Cash+5.00-5.00\n\n## Links\n\n- [separate charges and\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)",
