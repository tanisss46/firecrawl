# Start a team

## Learn how to invite and interact with team members.

You can [invite
members](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/team?invite_shown=true) of your
team to access your Stripe account. You must assign each team member at least
one role before you can invite them. Roles protect your sensitive information
and restrict the actions team members can perform on your account. See the [list
of actions](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/teams/roles) that each
role can and can’t perform before assigning the role to a team member.

You can invite team members individually, or invite multiple users at the same
time by separating their email addresses with a comma or space. You can also
assign multiple roles to a team member, which gives them the combined set of
permissions granted by those roles. Invites to your Stripe account expire after
10 days.

Invite a team member to access your Stripe account

After a team member has accepted their invite, you can edit their role at any
time from your account’s [Team](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/team)
settings. To edit a team member’s role, click the overflow menu (), then click
**Edit**.

## Mention team members

You can mention team members when you add a note to a payment. If you mention a
team member, they receive an email notification with the note and a link to the
associated payment.

## Receive email notifications

You can configure email notifications under **Communication preferences** in
your [Profile](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/user), and apply them on a
per-user basis. If your team members also want to receive notifications, they
must customize their own settings. Stripe sends email notifications to you when
any of the following events occur:

- A successful payment is received.
- An [application
fee](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees) is collected
from a connected account.
- A payment is [disputed](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes) by a customer.
- A payment is marked as [elevated
risk](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/risk-evaluation#elevated-risk) by Stripe or
a custom [Stripe Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) rule.
- You’re mentioned in a note.
- A customer sends an incorrect amount to pay their
[invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing).
- A [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) delivery fails.

For a full list of notification events, go to your **Communication preferences**
under **Profile**.
