Receives notification that payment is complete\n\n## Get started\n\nYou don’t have to integrate Boleto and other payment methods individually. If\nyou use our front-end products, Stripe automatically determines the most\nrelevant payment methods to display. Go to the [Stripe\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and enable\nBoleto. To get started with one of our hosted UIs, follow a quickstart:\n\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart): Our prebuilt, hosted\ncheckout page.\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart): Our drop-in UI\ncomponents.\n\n### Other payment products\n\nThe following Stripe products also let you add Boleto from the Dashboard:\n\n- [Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/no-code-guide)\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n- [Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview)\n\nIf your integration requires manually listing payment methods, learn how to\n[manually configure Boleto as a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/boleto/accept-a-payment).\n\nCheck out the Boleto [sample on\nGitHub](https://github.com/stripe-samples/accept-a-payment).\n\n## Disputes\n\nGenerally Boleto payments can’t be disputed by the customer. However, in some\ninstances irregularities similar to disputes (by the bank) can occur (for\nexample, due to mishandling). In these cases, Stripe will need to reach out to\nyou for next steps.\n\n## Refunds\n\nBoleto payments can’t be refunded. You need to create a separate process to\ncredit customers who require a refund.\n\n## Amount limits\n\nThe amount for a single Boleto must be at least R$5.00 and no more than\nR$49,999.99.\n\n## Links\n\n- [No](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/boleto#disputed-payments)\n- [No / No](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/boleto#refunds)\n- [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods)\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart)\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart)\n- [Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/no-code-guide)\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n- [Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview)\n- [manually configure Boleto as a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/boleto/accept-a-payment)\n- [sample on GitHub](https://github.com/stripe-samples/accept-a-payment)",
