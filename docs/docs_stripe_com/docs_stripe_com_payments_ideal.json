If you\nuse our front-end products, Stripe automatically determines the most relevant\npayment methods to display. Go to the [Stripe\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and enable\niDEAL. To get started with one of our hosted UIs, follow a quickstart:\n\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart): Our prebuilt, hosted\ncheckout page.\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart): Our drop-in UI\ncomponents.\n\n### Other payment products\n\nThe following Stripe products also let you add iDEAL from the Dashboard:\n\n- [Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/no-code-guide)\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n\nIf you prefer to manually list payment methods or want to save iDEAL details for\nfuture payments, see the following guides:\n\n- [Manually configure iDEAL as a payment\nmethod](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ideal/accept-a-payment)\n- [Save iDEAL details for future\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ideal/set-up-payment)\n\nCheck out the iDEAL [sample on\nGitHub](https://github.com/stripe-samples/accept-a-payment).\n\n## Disputes\n\nCustomers can’t dispute iDEAL payments with their bank. Encourage your customers\nto reach out to you directly with any concerns.\n\n## Refunds\n\niDEAL payments can be refunded up to 180 days after the original payment.\n\n## Website requirements\n\nIf you’re based in the Netherlands, your website must comply with iDEAL scheme\nrules by clearly displaying your KVK (company registration) number with the\nChamber of Commerce. If you aren’t based in the Netherlands, your website must\ndisplay your registration number with the equivalent local official body.\n\n## Links\n\n- [pricing details](https://stripe.com/pricing/local-payment-methods)\n- [second factor of\nauthentication](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#customer-actions)\n- [immediate\nnotification](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#payment-notification)\n- [SEPA Direct Debit](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/ideal)\n- [No](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ideal#disputed-payments)\n- [Yes / Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ideal#refunds)\n- [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods)\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart)\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart)\n- [Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/no-code-guide)\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n- [Manually configure iDEAL as a payment\nmethod](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ideal/accept-a-payment)\n- [Save iDEAL details for future\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ideal/set-up-payment)\n- [sample on GitHub](https://github.com/stripe-samples/accept-a-payment)",
