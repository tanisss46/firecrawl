# Company types

## Form a C corporation or an LLC using Stripe Atlas.

With Stripe Atlas, you can incorporate a Delaware C corporation (C corp), a
Delaware Limited Liability Company (LLC), or a subsidiary (also a C corp). Each
entity type is suited to different business needs. This guide outlines what you
need to know about each entity.

C corporationLLC
With Stripe Atlas, you can incorporate a new Delaware C corporation or a
subsidiary of an existing corporation. Here are a few characteristics that are
common to C corporations.

- **Ownership**: Used to grant equity to employees, advisors, and investors.
- **Capital** : Preferred by institutional investors who might be unable to
invest in LLCs.
- **Tax treatment**: Can typically use early startup losses to offset future
taxes, subject to some limitations.

If your company is a subsidiary of an existing company, you need to issue shares
to your parent company after incorporation. Atlas provides a standard template
that you can customize with a lawyer based on your specific circumstances.

## Tax implications of incorporating near the end of a calendar year

If you plan to incorporate near the end of the calendar year, consider the tax
implications. C corps and LLCs operating in Delaware before December 31 are
subject to annual tax for that year. Annual tax isnâ€™t prorated. Waiting until
January 1 to incorporate could save you a full year of Delaware annual tax.

Your company might also owe federal corporate income tax or taxes in other
states and countries. Consult with a tax professional to understand the tax
implications of incorporating near the end of a calendar year.
