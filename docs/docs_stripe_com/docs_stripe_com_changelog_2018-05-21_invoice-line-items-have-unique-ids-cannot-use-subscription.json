  "content": "# Invoice line items now have unique IDs andcan't be used in place of a subscriptionBreaking changes\n\n## What’s new\n\nThe `id` field of invoice line items of `type=subscription` can no longer be\ninterpreted as a subscription ID. It’s now a unique invoice line item ID, which\nyou can use for pagination.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis change alters the meaning of the `id` field for subscription-type invoice\nline items, making it a unique identifier for the line item itself rather than a\nsubscription ID. You can now use this `id` for pagination purposes when working\nwith invoice line items. This might require updates to existing code that relies\non interpreting these `id` values as subscription IDs.\n\n## Upgrade\n\n- [View your current API\nversion](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#view-your-api-version-and-the-latest-available-upgrade-in-workbench)\nin Workbench.\n- If you use an SDK, upgrade to the corresponding SDK version for this API\nversion.- If you don’t use an SDK, update your [API\nrequests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/versioning) to include `Stripe-Version:\n2018-05-21`\n- Upgrade the API version used for [webhook\nendpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks/versioning).\n- [Test your integration](https://docs.stripe.com/testing) against the new\nversion.\n- If you use Connect, [test your Connect\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/testing).\n- In Workbench, [perform the\nupgrade](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#perform-the-upgrade).
