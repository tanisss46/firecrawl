# The request field of the Events object now specifies both the request ID and idempotency keyBreaking changes

## What’s new

Updates the `request` property on the `Event` object to be a hash containing the
request ID and the idempotency key. Previously, `request` was just the ID.

## Impact

Expanding the request property on the `Event` object to include both the request
ID and idempotency key lets you access more detailed information about the API
request that triggered the event, particularly the idempotency key.
