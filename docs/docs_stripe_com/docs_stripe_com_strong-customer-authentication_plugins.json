  "content": "# SCA migration guide for plugins and developer libraries\n\n## Learn how to update your Stripe plugin or developer library to support Strong Customer Authentication (SCA).\n\n#### Note\n\nThis [SCA](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication) guide is\ndesigned for developers of Stripe plugins or libraries. If you’re a Stripe user\nlooking for an SCA-ready plugin, visit [Stripe\nPartners](https://stripe.com/partners/sca-ready).\n\n## Do I need to support SCA for my users?\n\nBusinesses in the [European Economic\nArea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Area) (EEA) that accept\nonline payments from customers in the EEA require you to use [3D\nSecure](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure). Transactions that don’t\nfollow these authentication guidelines might be declined by a customer’s bank,\nas of September 14th, 2019. This additional layer of authentication requires\nmigrating to SCA-ready solutions like\n[Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout) or [Payment\nIntents](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents).\n\n[Identify your plugin on our\nplatform](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication/plugins#identify-plugin)\nPlugins and third-party libraries should include identifying information so we\ncan contact you about future changes or critical updates to the API. Use the\n[setAppInfo function](https://docs.stripe.com/building-plugins#setappinfo) to\nprovide those details in your Stripe integration.\n\nWe encourage you to join the [Stripe Partner\nProgram](https://stripe.com/partner-program?utm_campaign=partnerprogram&utm_source=sca-plugins-guide),\nwhich includes [free\nregistration](https://stripe.com/partner-program?utm_campaign=partnerprogram&utm_source=sca-plugins-guide&utm_medium=join#stripe-partner-program)\nand more resources for developers building plugins. Learn more about [suggested\nbest practices](https://docs.stripe.com/building-plugins).\n\n[Determine your integration\npath](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication/plugins#determine-integration)\nFor developers of plugins or libraries:\n\n- **Choose Stripe Checkout when possible.** Checkout is a low-code integration\nthat lets you collect payments using a customizable form. You can embed the\npayment form on your website or host it on Stripe. To learn more about this\npayment integration option, see [Stripe\nCheckout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout).\n- **For more control over your checkout flow, use the Payment Intents and Setup\nIntents APIs.** These APIs work with\n[Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements), Stripe’s customizable UI\ncomponents for payment flows, and other Stripe APIs like\n[PaymentMethods](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods),\n[Customers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers), and\n[Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect). The [Payment\nIntents](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents) and [Setup\nIntents](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-and-reuse) APIs display\nauthentication flows like 3D Secure 2, save cards to use later, and support SCA.\n- **For recurring payments, use Stripe Billing.** Billing is a tool for managing\nsubscriptions and invoicing. To learn how to update your Billing implementation\nto support SCA requirements, see [SCA migration guide for\nBilling](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication).\n- **Programmatically subscribe your user to webhooks**: You can [register a\nwebhook endpoint](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks#register-webhook) for your\naccount or connected accounts and manage them with the\n[Webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) API, simplifying setup for your\nusers.\n\nIf none of these options work for your integration, [let us\nknow](mailto:plugins+sca@stripe.com).\n\n[Test dynamic\nauthentication](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication/plugins#test-dynamic-auth)\nAfter you have finished implementing the new integration path, configure your\n[Dynamic 3D Secure Radar\nrules](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure/authentication-flow#three-ds-radar)\nto test your integration using [3D Secure test\ncards](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure/authentication-flow#three-ds-cards).\nMake sure to test both successful and unsuccessful authentication cases.\n\n[Notify your users and\nStripe](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication/plugins#notify-users)\nWe recommend releasing an update for your users to let them know your payments\nsolution is SCA-ready. You can share the [guide to Strong Customer\nAuthentication](https://stripe.com/guides/strong-customer-authentication) with\nyour users to help them understand these regulatory changes. When you’ve\nreleased an SCA-ready update, please [let us\nknow](mailto:plugins+sca@stripe.com) as well.\n\n#### Caution\n\nProvide an SCA-ready update as soon as you’re finished updating. We direct users\nto SCA-ready solutions on the [Stripe\nPartners](https://stripe.com/partners/sca-ready) page.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Checkout Overview](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout)\n- [One-time Payments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents)\n- [Saving and Reusing Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-and-reuse)\n- [Migrating to Payment\nIntents](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents/migration)\n\n## Links\n\n- [SCA](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication)\n- [Stripe Partners](https://stripe.com/partners/sca-ready)\n- [European Economic Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Area)\n- [3D Secure](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure)\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout)\n- [Payment Intents](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents)\n- [setAppInfo function](https://docs.stripe.com/building-plugins#setappinfo)\n- [Stripe Partner\nProgram](https://stripe.com/partner-program?utm_campaign=partnerprogram&utm_source=sca-plugins-guide)\n- [free\nregistration](https://stripe.com/partner-program?utm_campaign=partnerprogram&utm_source=sca-plugins-guide&utm_medium=join#stripe-partner-program)\n- [suggested best practices](https://docs.stripe.com/building-plugins)\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements)\n- [PaymentMethods](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods)\n- [Customers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers)\n- [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)\n- [Setup Intents](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-and-reuse)\n- [SCA migration guide for\nBilling](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication)\n- [register a webhook\nendpoint](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks#register-webhook)\n- [Webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks)\n- [Dynamic 3D Secure Radar\nrules](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure/authentication-flow#three-ds-radar)\n- [3D Secure test\ncards](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure/authentication-flow#three-ds-cards)\n- [guide to Strong Customer\nAuthentication](https://stripe.com/guides/strong-customer-authentication)\n- [Migrating to Payment\nIntents](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents/migration)",
