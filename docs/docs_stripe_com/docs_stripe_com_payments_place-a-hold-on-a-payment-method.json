  "content": "# Place a hold on a payment method\n\n## Separate payment authorization and capture to create a charge now, but capture funds later.\n\nWhen you create a payment, you can place a hold on an eligible payment method to\nreserve funds that you can capture later. For example, hotels often authorize a\npayment in full before a guest arrives, then capture the money when the guest\nchecks out. This is sometimes referred to as manual capture.\n\nAuthorizing a payment guarantees the amount by holding it on the customer’s\npayment method. If you’re using the API, the\n[payment_method_details.card.capture_before](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-payment_method_details-card-capture_before)\nattribute on the charge indicates when the authorization expires.\n\nYou need to capture the funds before the authorization expires. If the\nauthorization expires before you capture the funds, the funds are released and\nthe payment status changes to `canceled`. Learn more about [statuses for\nasynchronous\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/paymentintents/lifecycle).\n\n## Authorization validity windows\n\nThe following tables outline validity windows for authorizing different\ntransaction types.\n\n### Card-not-present transactions\n\nCard brand [Merchant-Initiated\nTransaction](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/cits-and-mits) authorization\nvalidity window [Customer-Initiated\nTransaction](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/cits-and-mits) authorization\nvalidity window Visa5 days*7 daysMastercard7 days7 daysAmerican Express7 days7\ndaysDiscover7 days7 days\n* The exact authorization window is 4 days and 18 hours, to allow time for\nclearing processes.\n\n### Card-present transactions (in-person payments)\n\nCard brand Authorization validity window Visa5 days*Mastercard2 daysAmerican\nExpress2 daysDiscover2 days\n* The exact authorization window is 4 days and 18 hours, to allow time for\nclearing processes.\n\n### 30-day authorization windows in Japan\n\nIf your account is based in Japan, you can hold JPY-denominated transactions\nfrom Visa, Mastercard, JCB, Diners Club, and Discover for up to 30 days. Non-JPY\nand American Express transactions expire after the standard 7-day window.\n\n#### Note\n\nAs of April 14, 2024, Visa shortened the authorization window for online\n[Merchant-Initiated\nTransactions](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/cits-and-mits) from 7 days to 5\ndays. Visa also lengthened the authorization window for in-person (Terminal)\ntransactions from 2 days to 5 days.\n\n## Payment method limitations\n\nBefore implementing, understand the following limitations for authorizing and\ncapturing separately.\n\n- Only some payment methods support separate authorization and capture. Some\npayment methods that support this include cards, Affirm, Afterpay, Cash App Pay,\nKlarna, and PayPal. Some payment methods that don’t support this include\n[ACH](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ach-direct-debit) and\n[iDEAL](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ideal). Read more about [payment method\nfeature\nsupport](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/payment-method-support).\n- Beyond what is outlined in the tables above, other payment methods have\ndifferent rules and authorization windows:\n\n- Card payments: The amount is typically on hold for 7 days for online payments\nand 2 days for in-person Terminal payments (depending on the type of transaction\nand the card network). You can request an extended authorization for certain\n[online](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/extended-authorization) and [Terminal\npayment\nauthorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/extended-authorizations)\nthat are eligible for extended validity periods. Card networks may also restrict\n1 USD authorizations you don’t intend to capture.\n-\n[Affirm](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/affirm/accept-a-payment?platform=web#manual-capture):\nIf Affirm requires a down payment for very large order amounts, they charge the\namount during authorization and refund if the payment isn’t captured. You then\nhave 30 days to capture the payment balance.\n- [Afterpay /\nClearpay](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/afterpay-clearpay/accept-a-payment?web-or-mobile=web&payment-ui=direct-api#manual-capture):\nDuring authorization, the customer pays the first repayment installment.\nAfterpay refunds the payment if it’s never captured. You then have 13 days to\ncapture the payment balance.\n- [Cash App\nPay](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/cash-app-pay/accept-a-payment?web-or-mobile=web&payment-ui=direct-api#manual-capture):\nValid authorizations must be captured within 7 days to complete a payment.\n-\n[Klarna](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/klarna/accept-a-payment?web-or-mobile=web&payment-ui=direct-api#manual-capture):\nYou must capture the charge by midnight of the 28th calendar day after the\ncharge request, otherwise the authorization expires. For example, you’d need to\ncapture a charge request at UTC 2020-10-01 14:00 by UTC 2020-10-29 00:00.\n-\n[PayPal](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/paypal/accept-a-payment?web-or-mobile=web&payment-ui=direct-api#manual-capture):\nHolds the amount for 10 days. Stripe automatically attempts to extend the hold\nfor another 10 days, totalling 20 days. Your [settlement\npreference](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/paypal/choose-settlement-preference)\nmight affect the authorization period. See [separate authorization and\ncapture](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/paypal/accept-a-payment?web-or-mobile=web&payment-ui=direct-api#manual-capture)\nfor more information.\n\n## Use the Dashboard to authorize and capture\n\nYou can authorize a payment and capture funds separately without writing code.\n\n- In the Dashboard, [create a new\npayment](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payments/new). Select **One-time**.\n- When you enter or select the payment method, select **More options** then\n**Capture funds later**.\n\nThe payment appears in your [payments\npage](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payments) as **Uncaptured**.\n\nTo capture the funds, go to the payment details page and click **Capture**.\n\n## Tell Stripe to authorize only\n\nTo indicate that you want separate authorization and capture, specify\n[capture_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-capture_method)\nas `manual` when creating the PaymentIntent. This parameter instructs Stripe to\nauthorize the amount but not capture it on the customer’s payment method.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d amount=1099 \\\n -d currency=usd \\\n -d \"payment_method_types[]\"=card \\\n -d capture_method=manual\n```\n\nWith the above approach, you tell Stripe that you can only use “capture after”\nfor a PaymentIntent with eligible payment methods. For example, you can’t accept\ncard payments and SEPA Direct Debit (which doesn’t support capture after) for a\nsingle PaymentIntent. To accept payment methods that might not all support\ncapture after, you can configure capture-after-per-payment-method by configuring\n`capture_method=manual` on the `payment_method_options[<payment_method_type>]`\nobject.\n\nFor example, by configuring\n`payment_method_options[card][capture_method]=manual`, you’re placing only card\npayments on hold. You can manage payment methods from the\n[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods). Stripe\nhandles the logic for [dynamically\ndisplaying](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/dynamic-payment-methods)\nthe most relevant eligible payment methods to each customer based on factors\nsuch as the transaction’s amount, currency, and payment flow.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d amount=1099 \\\n -d currency=usd \\\n -d \"automatic_payment_methods[enabled]\"=true \\\n -d \"payment_method_options[card][capture_method]\"=manual\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can list `card` and `sepa_debit` using [payment method\ntypes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-payment_method_types)\nlike in the example below.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d amount=1099 \\\n -d currency=eur \\\n -d \"payment_method_types[]\"=card \\\n -d \"payment_method_types[]\"=sepa_debit \\\n -d \"payment_method_options[card][capture_method]\"=manual\n```\n\nBefore continuing to capture, attach a payment method with card details to the\nPaymentIntent, and authorize the card by confirming the PaymentIntent. You can\ndo this by setting the `payment_method` and `confirm` fields on the\nPaymentIntent.\n\n#### Extended authorizations\n\nUsually, an authorization for an online card payment is valid for 7 days. To\nincrease the validity period, you can [place an extended hold on an online card\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/extended-authorization).\n\n## Capture the funds\n\nAfter the payment method is authorized, the PaymentIntent\n[status](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-status)\ntransitions to `requires_capture`. To capture the authorized funds, make a\nPaymentIntent [capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/capture)\nrequest. This captures the total authorized amount by default. To capture less\nor (for certain online card payments) more than the initial amount, pass the\n[amount_to_capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/capture#capture_payment_intent-amount_to_capture)\noption. A partial capture automatically releases the remaining amount. If\nattempting to capture more than the initial amount for an online card payment,\nrefer to the [overcapture\ndocumentation](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/overcapture).\n\nThe following example demonstrates how to capture 7.50 USD of the authorized\n10.99 USD payment:\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents/pi_123/capture \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d amount_to_capture=750\n```\n\nAlthough some card payments are eligible for\n[multicapture](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/multicapture), you can only\nperform one capture on an authorized payment for most payments. If you partially\ncapture a payment, you can’t perform another capture for the difference.\n(Instead, consider [saving the customer’s payment method details for\nlater](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-during-payment#save-payment-details-for-future-use)\nand creating future payments as needed.)\n\nCard statements from some issuers and interfaces from payment methods don’t\nalways distinguish between authorizations and captured (settled) payments, which\ncan sometimes confuse customers.\n\nAdditionally, when a customer completes the payment process on a PaymentIntent\nwith manual capture, it triggers the `payment_intent.amount_capturable_updated`\nevent. You can inspect the PaymentIntent’s\n[amount_capturable](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-amount_capturable)\nproperty to see the total amount that you can capture from the PaymentIntent.\n\n## Cancel the authorization\n\nIf you need to cancel an authorization, you can [cancel the\nPaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/refunds#cancel-payment).\n\n## See also\n\n- [Separate authorization and capture with\nCheckout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web&ui=stripe-hosted#auth-and-capture)\n- [Place an extended hold on an online card\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/extended-authorization)\n\n## Links\n\n- [sample app on GitHub](https://github.com/stripe-samples/placing-a-hold)\n-\n[payment_method_details.card.capture_before](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-payment_method_details-card-capture_before)\n- [statuses for asynchronous\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/paymentintents/lifecycle)\n- [Merchant-Initiated\nTransaction](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/cits-and-mits)\n- [ACH](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ach-direct-debit)\n- [iDEAL](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ideal)\n- [payment method feature\nsupport](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/payment-method-support)\n- [online](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/extended-authorization)\n- [Terminal payment\nauthorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/extended-authorizations)\n-\n[Affirm](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/affirm/accept-a-payment?platform=web#manual-capture)\n- [Afterpay /\nClearpay](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/afterpay-clearpay/accept-a-payment?web-or-mobile=web&payment-ui=direct-api#manual-capture)\n- [Cash App\nPay](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/cash-app-pay/accept-a-payment?web-or-mobile=web&payment-ui=direct-api#manual-capture)\n-\n[Klarna](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/klarna/accept-a-payment?web-or-mobile=web&payment-ui=direct-api#manual-capture)\n-\n[PayPal](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/paypal/accept-a-payment?web-or-mobile=web&payment-ui=direct-api#manual-capture)\n- [settlement\npreference](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/paypal/choose-settlement-preference)\n- [create a new payment](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payments/new)\n- [payments page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payments)\n-\n[capture_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-capture_method)\n- [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods)\n- [dynamically\ndisplaying](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/dynamic-payment-methods)\n- [payment method\ntypes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-payment_method_types)\n-\n[status](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-status)\n- [capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/capture)\n-\n[amount_to_capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/capture#capture_payment_intent-amount_to_capture)\n- [overcapture documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/overcapture)\n- [multicapture](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/multicapture)\n- [saving the customer’s payment method details for\nlater](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-during-payment#save-payment-details-for-future-use)\n-\n[amount_capturable](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-amount_capturable)\n- [cancel the PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/refunds#cancel-payment)\n- [Separate authorization and capture with\nCheckout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web&ui=stripe-hosted#auth-and-capture)",
