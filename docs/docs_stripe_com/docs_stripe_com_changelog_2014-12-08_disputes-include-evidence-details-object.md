# Disputes now include an evidence_details object for evidence documentationBreaking changes

## What’s new

Updates the `Dispute` object so evidence can be provided as a hash of typed
fields rather than a single block of text. Replaces the `evidence_due_by`
property with the `evidence_details` hash, which includes `due_by` and
`submission_count` for the number of times a dispute has been submitted.

## Impact

Updating the `Dispute` object to accept structured evidence gives you more
detailed evidence submission information.
