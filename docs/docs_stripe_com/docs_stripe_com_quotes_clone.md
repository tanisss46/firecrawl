# Renegotiate a quote

## Modify finalized quotes by duplicating and updating them as new drafts.

#### Note

You can use quotes in test mode. To finalize, download, or accept quotes in live
mode for one-time invoices through the API or Dashboard, you must upgrade to
[Invoicing Plus](https://stripe.com/invoicing/pricing). See which plan [is right
for you](https://support.stripe.com/questions/how-to-access-quotes).

After you finalize and send a quote to your customer, you might need to make
additional changes. For example, you want to apply a discount or fee. Stripe
lets you duplicate a finalized quote, which creates a new draft quote with the
same details as the original. You can update the new draft quote until ​​you’re
ready to finalize and send it to your customer. If the quote is an open state,
you can duplicate or revise it.
