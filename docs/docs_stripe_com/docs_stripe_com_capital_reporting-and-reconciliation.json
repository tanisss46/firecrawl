You might want to include Capital transactions in your\nplatform or accounting software so your users can reconcile their transactions.\n\nWe offer two options for fetching transactions:\n\n- [Financing Transactions\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api/capital/financing_transactions): We recommend\nusing the Financing Transactions API, which includes extra transaction\ninformation specific to Capital.\n- [Balance Transactions API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/balance_transactions):\nIf you already have an integration with the Balance Transactions API, Capital\nBalance Transactions return most transaction types, but they lack additional\ndetail (such as the associated Capital [Financing\nOffer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/capital/connect_financing_object)).\nFinancing TransactionsRecommendedBalance Transactions\n## Payout transactions\n\nWhen you enable an automatic [payout](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts) schedule,\nyour connected account receives their financing payout automatically. Otherwise,\nyou need to [Create a payout](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payouts/create) of\n`source_type=financing` to manually pay out the user’s financing.\n\nFinancing payouts have a corresponding [Financing\nTransaction](https://docs.stripe.com/api/capital/financing_transaction_object)\nof type `payout`. After a `payout` Financing Transaction is created, Stripe\nsends a [capital.financing_transaction.created\nwebhook](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-capital.financing_transaction.created).\nHowever, it might take several business days for the ACH funds to arrive in the\nconnected account’s bank account.\n\n## Paydown transactions\n\nCapital has three types of paydown transactions:\n\n- **Witholding paydowns**: When connected accounts (users) apply for financing,\nthey agree that Stripe can withhold a fixed percentage of their future earnings\nuntil they’ve paid back the total financing amount.\n- **User-initiated paydowns**: Users can manually make a payment towards their\nfinancing on the [Hosted Capital Reporting\npage](https://docs.stripe.com/capital/api-integration#approve-application).\n- **Collection attempts**: Stripe’s Servicing team might initiate paydowns in\naccordance with the [Capital collections\npolicy](https://docs.stripe.com/capital/how-capital-for-platforms-works#capital-collections).\n\nAll paydowns have a corresponding [Financing\nTransaction](https://docs.stripe.com/api/capital/financing_transaction_object)\nof type `payment`. You can [Retrieve Financing\nTransactions](https://docs.stripe.com/api/capital/financing_transactions/retrieve)\nand filter by transaction type if you want to display withholding transactions\nin your UI. Make sure you provide the account ID of the connected account in the\n`Stripe-Account` header.\n\n```\ncurl -G https://api.stripe.com/v1/capital/financing_transactions \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -H \"Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}\" \\\n -d type=paydown\n```\n\nIf the retrieval of the Financing Transactions list is successful, you receive a\nresponse similar to the following:\n\n```\n{\n \"object\": \"list\",\n\"url\":\n\"/v1/capital/financing_transactions?financing_offer=financingoffer_1NAdVWJQ3aJgxqz5nh90Zqrs&charge=ch_1HoZftJQ3aJgxqz50EbvL8zU\",\n \"has_more\": false,\n \"data\": [\n {\n \"id\": \"cptxn_1NAdVWJQ3aJgxqz5FSScvJaF\",\n \"object\": \"capital.financing_transaction\",\n \"account\": \"acct_1HLGiXJQ3aJgxqz5\",\n \"created_at\": 1684780258,\n \"details\": {\n \"advance_amount\": 10000,\n \"currency\": \"usd\",\n \"fee_amount\": 1000,\n \"linked_payment\": \"ch_1HoZftJQ3aJgxqz50EbvL8zU\",\n \"reason\": \"automatic_withholding\",\n \"total_amount\": 11000,\n \"transaction\": {\n \"charge\": \"ch_1HoZftJQ3aJgxqz50EbvL8zU\"\n }\n },\n \"financing_offer\": \"financingoffer_1NAdVWJQ3aJgxqz5nh90Zqrs\",\n \"livemode\": true,\n \"type\": \"payment\",\n \"user_facing_description\": \"Paydown of your loan\"\n },\n {...},\n {...}\n ]\n}\n```\n\nThe response contains information describing how this particular paydown\naffected the outstanding financed amount. If the paydown occurred because of\n`\"details.reason\": \"automatic_withholding\"`, it also contains a reference to the\noriginal Stripe payment in the `details.transaction` field.\n\n### Destination Charges\n\nIf your platform processes payments using [Destination\nCharges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges) and you’d like to\nreconcile the [Financing\nTransaction](https://docs.stripe.com/api/capital/financing_transaction_object)\npaydown with the original charge which occurred on your platform, you can do\nthis by first extracting the charge ID in the [Financing\nTransaction](https://docs.stripe.com/api/capital/financing_transaction_object)’s\n`details.transaction` field. This will be set to the payment ID which occurred\nas a result of the automatic\n[Transfer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers/object) to the connected\naccount.\n\n```\n{\n \"id\": \"cptxn_1NBJQR2eZvKYlo2CBUy2GQ1S\",\n \"object\": \"capital.financing_transaction\",\n \"details\": {\n \"reason\": \"automatic_withholding\",\n \"transaction\": {\n \"charge\": \"py_1NBJI62c99H72o8MUEN0fIZx\"\n },\n ...\n },\n \"type\": \"payment\",\n ...\n}\n```\n\nYou can then use the [Retrieve Charge\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/retrieve) to get back the charge\nobject:\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/charges/py_1NBJI62c99H72o8MUEN0fIZx \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\"\n```\n\n```\n{\n \"id\": \"py_1NBJI62c99H72o8MUEN0fIZx\",\n \"object\": \"charge\",\n \"source_transfer\": \"tr_3NBJGW2eZvKYlo2C1jQOxNwF\",\n ...\n}\n```\n\nBecause this is a Destination Charge, the `source_transfer` is populated with\nthe [Transfer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers/object) ID. Finally, you\ncan then use the [Retrieve Transfer\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers/retrieve) to get back the Transfer\nobject:\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/transfers/tr_3NBJGW2eZvKYlo2C1jQOxNwF \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\"\n```\n\n```\n{\n \"id\": \"tr_3NBJGW2eZvKYlo2C1jQOxNwF\",\n \"object\": \"transfer\",\n \"source_transaction\": \"ch_3NBJGW2eZvKYlo2C17oDFajw\",\n ...\n}\n```\n\nThe `source_transaction` field contains the ID of the\n[Charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_provider/payment/object) which\noccurred on your platform, triggering a\n[Transfer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers/object) to the connected\naccount.\n\n## Reversal transactions\n\nPayout and paydown transactions can be reversed for any of the following\nreasons:\n\n- **Failed ACH debit:** A connected account’s bank account might have\ninsufficient funds to cover the paydown.\n- **Financing cancelation:** If a connected account cancels the financing offer\nafter accepting, we issue a debit to recoup the funds and reverse the payout of\nthe financing.\n- **One-off manual reversals:** When a charge is refunded, we don’t reverse the\npaydown [Financing\nTransaction](https://docs.stripe.com/api/capital/financing_transaction_object).\nHowever, users can contact\n[capital-support@stripe.com](mailto:capital-support@stripe.com) to request that\nwe reverse the paydown, which we might honor depending on the nature of the\nreversal. If this happens, we ask you provide as much information and context as\nto the original charge and why it was refunded.\n\nReversal of a paydown or payout transaction creates a [Financing\nTransaction](https://docs.stripe.com/api/capital/financing_transaction_object)\nof type `reversal`.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Financing Transactions\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api/capital/financing_transactions)\n- [Balance Transactions API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/balance_transactions)\n- [Financing\nOffer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/capital/connect_financing_object)\n- [payout](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts)\n- [Create a payout](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payouts/create)\n- [Financing\nTransaction](https://docs.stripe.com/api/capital/financing_transaction_object)\n- [capital.financing_transaction.created\nwebhook](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-capital.financing_transaction.created)\n- [Hosted Capital Reporting\npage](https://docs.stripe.com/capital/api-integration#approve-application)\n- [Capital collections\npolicy](https://docs.stripe.com/capital/how-capital-for-platforms-works#capital-collections)\n- [Retrieve Financing\nTransactions](https://docs.stripe.com/api/capital/financing_transactions/retrieve)\n- [Destination Charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges)\n- [Transfer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers/object)\n- [Retrieve Charge API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/retrieve)\n- [Retrieve Transfer API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers/retrieve)\n- [Charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_provider/payment/object)",
