You can accept USDC payments on Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon\nwithout the complexity of holding or converting crypto to fiat yourself. We\n[charge](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/pay-with-crypto#feature-set) 1.5% of the\ntransaction amount (in USD).\n\nPay with Crypto works with\n[Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout),\n[Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements), or can be directly\nintegrated through the [Payment Intents\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents). When integrated, the\noption to pay with **Crypto** appears that redirects your customers to a page\nhosted by *crypto.link.com* to complete their payment. There, they can connect\ntheir wallet and save and reuse their account using\n[Link](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link). Before you get started, see our\n[demo](https://buy.stripe.com/test_28o4ig0SY9Xq8co3cc) showcasing Pay with\nCrypto in action.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe following example assumes you’ve added Pay with Crypto to the [Payment\nElement](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element):\n\n- After you set up Pay with Crypto, the option to select **Crypto** as a payment\nmethod appears in your checkout form.\n- When your customer clicks this option, they’re redirected to a page hosted by\n*crypto.link.com*, where they can:\n\n- Confirm the amount they need to pay.\n- Connect the wallet they want to pay with.\n- Confirm the payment by signing the transaction that transfers the USDC from\ntheir wallet.\n- After Stripe confirms the payment, the customer sees that the transaction is\ncomplete. And just like any other Stripe transaction, you see an update to your\nStripe balance.\n\n![Pay with\nCrypto](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/hypernian-pay-with-crypto.3cdcc246f271a82bb6a9368cd4d8ac72.png)\n\nAdd crypto as a payment option to your checkout page\n\n## Feature set\n\nThe following table contains the feature snapshot for Pay with Crypto:\n\nAvailabilityUS-based businessesFeatures- Implementable through Stripe’s Payment\nElement, Checkout, or directly through the Payment Intents API.\n- Zero dispute liability for integrating businesses.\n- Returning customers get one-click checkout using Link.\nRecurring\npayments[Supported](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/pay-with-crypto#billing) with\n`send_invoice` [collection\nmethod](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/collection-method) subscriptions.[Manual\ncapture](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/place-a-hold-on-a-payment-method)Not\nsupportedCurrencies- USDC on Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon\n- USDP on Ethereum and Solana\nEnd customersGlobal (except for sanctioned countries)TransactionsTransaction\nlimits on the end customer are 10,000 USD per transaction and 100,000 USD per\nmonth.Pricing1.5% of the transaction amount (in USD)\n#### Public preview\n\nPay with Crypto is a new feature. If you have any questions or feedback, contact\n[pay-with-crypto@stripe.com](mailto:pay-with-crypto@stripe.com).\n\n## Onboarding\n\nBefore you can enable Pay with Crypto:\n\n- [Activate](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/activate) a Stripe\naccount, if you haven’t already, ensuring that we’ve approved you to process\npayments.\n- Go to your [payment methods\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods), and request\nthe **Crypto** payment method.\n- Fill out your business’s information and accept the terms on the page.\n- After we review your information and approve you, the **Crypto** payment\nmethod becomes active in the Dashboard. If the payment method appears as\npending, we’re still reviewing your candidacy and might reach out to you for\nmore details.\n\nConsider the following before integrating Pay with Crypto:\n\n- **Refunds:** To issue a refund, follow the [refund\nflow](https://docs.stripe.com/refunds). For crypto payments, the refund goes\nback as stablecoins in the customer’s original wallet.\n- **Holding crypto:** Transactions settle in USD to your Stripe balance.\n- **Settlement currencies:** We currently only support USD settlement.\n\n## Billing\n\nUse [Stripe Billing](https://stripe.com/billing) to create Crypto supported\n[invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices) and\n[subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating). Crypto\ninvoices and subscriptions only support the `send_invoice` [collection\nmethod](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/collection-method).\n\n## Connect support\n\nThe following [Connect charge](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges) types,\ntypically used by Connect platforms, are available to businesses using Pay with\nCrypto. Connected accounts must directly enable **Crypto** in their [payment\nmethod settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) before\nthey can accept crypto payments. You can’t enable crypto payments through the\n[Accounts API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/) or [Capabilities\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api/capabilities).\n\nDestination chargesSeparate charges and transfersDirect chargeson_behalf_of\n\n## Links\n\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout)\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements)\n- [Payment Intents API](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents)\n- [Link](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link)\n- [demo](https://buy.stripe.com/test_28o4ig0SY9Xq8co3cc)\n- [Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element)\n- [Supported](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/pay-with-crypto#billing)\n- [collection method](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/collection-method)\n- [Manual\ncapture](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/place-a-hold-on-a-payment-method)\n- [Activate](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/activate)\n- [payment methods\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods)\n- [refund flow](https://docs.stripe.com/refunds)\n- [Stripe Billing](https://stripe.com/billing)\n- [invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n- [subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating)\n- [Connect charge](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges)\n- [Accounts API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/)\n- [Capabilities API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/capabilities)",
