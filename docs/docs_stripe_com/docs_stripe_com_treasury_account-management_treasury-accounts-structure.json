A crucial first step in that understanding is to learn the\ndifferent account types involved with a Treasury integration.\n\n## Account types\n\nYour platform must have Stripe [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect) to use\nTreasury. In its most basic form, a Connect integration includes a platform\naccount with many connected accounts, each owned by a seller or service provider\nthat uses the platform. Both the platform account and its connected accounts are\n[Account](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts) objects in the Stripe API.\n\nTreasury only supports connected accounts that don’t use a Stripe-hosted\ndashboard and where your platform is responsible for requirements collection and\nloss liability, including Custom connected accounts. Learn how to [create\nconnected\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/design-an-integration?connect-onboarding-surface=api&connect-dashboard-type=none&connect-economic-model=buy-rate&connect-loss-liability-owner=platform&connect-charge-type=direct)\nthat work with Treasury.\n\n#### Private preview\n\nEnabling Treasury on non-custom connected accounts is a new feature. Email\n[treasury-support@stripe.com](mailto:treasury-support@stripe.com) to request\naccess.\n\nAs a platform with connected accounts, you’re responsible for maintaining a\nminimum API version, communicating terms of service updates to your connected\naccounts, handling information requests from them, and providing them with\nsupport. Because your platform is ultimately responsible for the losses your\nconnected accounts incur, you’re also responsible for vetting them for fraud. To\nlearn more, read the [Treasury fraud\nguide](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/examples/fraud-guide).\n\n![Flow chart with lines connecting a platform with three different connected\naccounts.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/connected-accounts.7443ee88f52a49904439afc21ded676e.png)\n\nA Connect platform with connected accounts\n\nStripe Treasury introduces another type of account to the Stripe ecosystem:\nfinancial accounts. When you onboard your platform to Treasury, Stripe\nautomatically creates and assigns a `FinancialAccount` object to your platform\naccount. As the platform, you request the `treasury` capability when requesting\nthe capabilities you need for your connected accounts. After you request it,\nStripe updates the connected account’s `Account` object to include additional\nrequirements in its [requirements\nhash](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-requirements).\nYou can create financial accounts for your connected accounts, but until you\ngather the requirements from your connected account owners, the financial\naccounts aren’t accessible. For more information on using Treasury financial\naccounts, see the [Working with financial\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/account-management/financial-accounts)\nguide.\n\n## Account balances\n\nEach account in Stripe Connect (both platform and connected accounts) has an\n[account balance](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-balances) that tracks\npending and available funds for that account. With Stripe Treasury, each of\nthese accounts can also have a financial account, which has a balance of its\nown. Treasury provides you the tools to transfer funds between the platform\naccount and financial account, but their respective balances always remain\nseparate. However, funds can’t be transferred from a platform end-user’s\nfinancial account to their connected account. For more information on platform\nand connected account balances, see the [Understanding Connect account\nbalances](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-balances) guide. For more\ninformation on financial account balances, see the [Working with balances and\ntransactions](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/account-management/working-with-balances-and-transactions)\nguide.\n\n![Flow chart with a line connecting a platform account with a connected account.\nFor each account, two lines connect both a payments account balance and a\nfinancial account balance. A double arrow with a dollar sign shows funds flow\nbetween each accounts balances and a one direction arrow with a dollar sign flow\nfrom the platform financial account balance to the connected account financial\naccount\nbalance.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fund-flow.6fb714d66e6c95a45f14066001c290bc.png)\n\nFlow of funds between accounts\n\n## Flow of funds between accounts\n\nAlthough the payments balance and financial account balances are separate,\nTreasury supports the flow of funds between the two. Treasury also enables you\nto transfer funds from your platform financial account to the financial accounts\nattached to your platform’s connected accounts. You can use\n[Payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payouts) to send funds from your payment\nbalance to your financial account or to the financial accounts attached to your\nplatform’s connected accounts. To move money between two financial accounts,\nTreasury introduces\n[OutboundPayment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/outbound_payments)\nobjects to facilitate this movement.\n\nTransfers affect funds on the Stripe Account Balance, so if you want to move\nfunds between two financial accounts, you must use OutboundPayments.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)\n- [Account](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts)\n- [create connected\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/design-an-integration?connect-onboarding-surface=api&connect-dashboard-type=none&connect-economic-model=buy-rate&connect-loss-liability-owner=platform&connect-charge-type=direct)\n- [Treasury fraud guide](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/examples/fraud-guide)\n- [requirements\nhash](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-requirements)\n- [Working with financial\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/account-management/financial-accounts)\n- [account balance](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-balances)\n- [Working with balances and\ntransactions](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/account-management/working-with-balances-and-transactions)\n- [Payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payouts)\n- [OutboundPayment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/outbound_payments)",
