When you\nconnect to a new account, you must reactivate your preferred payment methods.\n\n- On the **Stripe Configuration** page, click **Connect with Stripe in Live\nMode**. If you want to test different app functionality without processing live\npayments, use **Connect with Stripe in Test Mode**.\n- Provide your business information to [create your Stripe\naccount](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register).\n- After you create your Stripe account, log in to your [Stripe\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/).\n- In the Stripe Dashboard, do the following:\n\n- Under **Settings** > **Payment methods**, select your Shopware account from\nthe **Select your platform** drop-down.\n- Turn on your preferred payment methods individually or by using the **Turn on\nall** button.\n\nThe payment methods you choose for your Shopware connector are separate from\nyour [Stripe account payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/integration-options).\n\n## Connect multiple channels\n\nYou can use separate Stripe accounts to connect to different sales channels.\n\n- For each channel, the **Sales Channels** tab in the Stripe configuration page\ndisplays:- A **Connect with Stripe in Test mode** button\n- A **Connect with Stripe in Live mode** button\n- The corresponding Stripe account name and Stripe account ID.\n- Your main account is connected by default. Uncheck the **Use default account**\ncheckbox and click **Connect with Stripe […]** to specify the Stripe account for\neach sales channel.\n\n## Choose your payment form\n\nConfigure the payment form that displays to your customers during checkout.\nUnder **Payment form settings**, you can choose from the following:\n\n- **Integrated payment form**–The [Payment\nElement](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element) is an embeddable UI\ncomponent that lets you accept 25+ payment methods with a single integration.\n\n![Integrated payment form with Payment\nElement](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/connector_payment_form_element.424e5b7d979120ca7615409e62bb86bc.png)\n\n- **Redirect to Stripe**–[Stripe\nCheckout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout) lets you redirect your\ncustomers to a Stripe-hosted, customizable checkout page to finalize payment.\n\n![Stripe-hosted checkout\npage](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/connector_payment_form_checkout.9846147c723ca1610638c755de28ebc9.png)\n\n## Customize the payment form\n\nYou can configure the appearance of the integrated payment form in the following\nways:\n\n- Choose a prebuilt theme: **Stripe**, **Night**, **Flat**, or **None**.\n- Position the payment form: **On top of the Shopware payment methods**, **At\nthe bottom of the Shopware payment methods**, or **With the Shopware payment\nmethods**.\n- Use the [Elements Appearance\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/appearance-api) to customize individual\naspects of the payment form by editing\n`Resources/app/storefront/src/StripePaymentsApp/stripe.appearance.js` in your\nlocal project.\n\nYou can customize the look and feel of Checkout (**Redirect to Stripe**) in the\n[Dashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/customization).\n\n## Collect your customer’s postal code\n\nYou can specify whether or not to collect your customer’s postal code at\ncheckout using the **Never collect the postal code** field. Stripe recommends\ncollecting and verifying postal code information, which can help decrease the\ncard decline rate.\n\n- (Recommended) **Unselect** this field if you want to require a postal code at\ncheckout. This applies to cards issued in Canada, the United Kingdom, or the\nUnited States.\n- **Select** this field if you don’t want to collect a postal code at checkout.\n\n## Choose how to capture funds\n\nYou can specify how you want to authorize and capture funds.\n\n- **Simultaneous authorization and capture**–The issuing bank confirms that the\ncardholder can pay, and then transfers the funds automatically after\nconfirmation.\n- **Separate authorization and capture**–The authorization occurs first, and the\ncapture occurs later. To capture funds, change the order’s payment status from\n`Authorized` to `Paid` or `Partially paid` in the Shopware administration panel.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Overview](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/shopware6)\n- [Install the\nconnector](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/shopware6/installation)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Shopware 6](https://www.shopware.com/en/)\n- [install](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/shopware6/installation)\n- [Connect to Stripe to accept\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/shopware6/configuration#connect-stripe)\n- [Choose your payment\nform](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/shopware6/configuration#payment-form)\n- [Customize the payment\nform](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/shopware6/configuration#customize-payment-form)\n- [Collect your customer’s postal\ncode](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/shopware6/configuration#postal-code)\n- [Choose how to capture\nfunds](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/shopware6/configuration#capture-funds)\n- [create your Stripe account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register)\n- [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/)\n- [Stripe account payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/integration-options)\n- [Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element)\n- [Stripe Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout)\n- [Elements Appearance API](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/appearance-api)\n- [Dashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/customization)\n- [Overview](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/shopware6)",
