To request access, contact [Stripe\nsupport](https://support.stripe.com/). After we enable the feature, you must\nactivate it by disconnecting from and reconnecting to your readers.\n\nYou can save MOTO card details only in the following countries:\n\nAustraliaCanadaNew ZealandSingaporeUnited\nStatesServer-driveniOSAndroidJavaScript\nMOTO SetupIntents allow you to enter the card information on the reader and save\nthe payment details without charging the card.\n\nTo do this with a server-driven integration, you must:\n\n- [Create or retrieve a\nCustomer](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/mail-telephone-orders/save-directly#create-customer).\n- [Create a\nSetupIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/mail-telephone-orders/save-directly#create-setup-intent).\n- [Process the\nSetupIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/mail-telephone-orders/save-directly#process-setupintent).\n- [Verify the reader\nstate](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/mail-telephone-orders/save-directly#verify-reader-state).\n- [Use the\nPaymentMethod](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/mail-telephone-orders/save-directly#use-payment-method).\n\n![MOTO saving card\nscreenshots](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/moto-save-card-light.e745c8d7833fd8290aa7827c57139c6a.png)\n\nSaving a card with MOTO flow\n\n[Create or retrieve a\nCustomer](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/mail-telephone-orders/save-directly#create-customer)\nTo charge a card saved with Stripe, you must attach it to a\n[Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers).\n\nWhen you include a customer in your\n[SetupIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents) before confirming,\nStripe automatically attaches the generated card payment method to the provided\n[Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers) object that you\ncreate/retrieve.\n\nInclude the following code on your server to create a new `Customer`:\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers \\\n -u sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2: \\\n -X \"POST\"\n```\n\n[Create a\nSetupIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/mail-telephone-orders/save-directly#create-setup-intent)\nA [SetupIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents) is an object that\nrepresents your intent to set up a customer’s payment method for future\npayments. The SetupIntent tracks the steps of this setup process. The\n[payment_method_types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents/create#create_setup_intent-payment_method_types)\nmust include `card`.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/setup_intents \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d customer={{CUSTOMER_ID}} \\\n -d \"payment_method_types[]\"=card\n```\n\n[Process the\nSetupIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/mail-telephone-orders/save-directly#process-setup-intent)\nAfter you create the SetupIntent, use\n[process_setup_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_setup_intent)\nto process the payment, setting\n[process_config[moto]](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_setup_intent#process_setup_intent-process_config)\nto `true`. If the customer provides the required form of agreement or consent,\nset the `customer_consent_collected` Boolean to true.\n\n```\ncurl\nhttps://api.stripe.com/v1/terminal/readers/{{READER_ID}}/process_setup_intent \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d setup_intent={{SETUP_INTENT_ID}} \\\n -d \"process_config[moto]\"=true \\\n -d customer_consent_collected=true\n```\n\nThe\n[process_setup_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_setup_intent)\nrequest is asynchronous. After the request, the reader prompts you to enter the\ncardholder’s card number, CVC, expiration date, and postal code. You can then\nconfirm the cardholder’s details to submit the card details for authorization.\n\n[Verify the reader\nstate](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/mail-telephone-orders/save-directly#verify-reader-state)\nYour application must follow the instructions for [verifying the reader\nstate](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/collect-card-payment?terminal-sdk-platform=server-driven&reader=wpe#verify-reader)\nto confirm a successful (approved) SetupIntent.\n\n[Use the\nPaymentMethod](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/mail-telephone-orders/save-directly#use-payment-method)\nYou can now charge the saved PaymentMethod associated with the `Customer` using\na\n[PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-payment_method).\n\n## Compliance\n\nYou’re responsible for your compliance with all applicable laws, regulations,\nand network rules when saving a customer’s payment details. For example, the\nEuropean Data Protection Board has issued guidance regarding saving payment\ndetails. These requirements generally apply if you want to save your customer’s\npayment method for future use, such as presenting a customer’s payment method to\nthem in the checkout flow for a future purchase or charging them when they’re\nnot actively using your website or app.\n\nAdd terms to your website or app that state how you plan to save payment method\ndetails and allow customers to opt in. If you plan to charge the customer while\nthey’re offline, then at a minimum, make sure that your terms also cover the\nfollowing:\n\n- The customer’s agreement to your initiating a payment or a series of payments\non their behalf for specified transactions.\n- The anticipated timing and frequency of payments (for instance, whether\ncharges are for scheduled installment or subscription payments, or for\nunscheduled top-ups).\n- How the payment amount is determined.\n- Your cancellation policy, if you’re setting up the payment method for a\nsubscription service.\n\nMake sure you keep a record of your customer’s written agreement to these terms.\n\nWhen you save a payment method, it can only be used for the specific usage that\nyou included in your terms. If you want to charge customers when they’re offline\nand also save the customer’s payment method to present to them as a saved\npayment method for future purchases, you must explicitly collect consent from\nthe customer. One way to do so is with a “Save my payment method for future use”\ncheckbox.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Stripe support](https://support.stripe.com/)\n- [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers)\n- [SetupIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents)\n- [Create a SetupIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents/create)\n-\n[payment_method_types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents/create#create_setup_intent-payment_method_types)\n-\n[process_setup_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_setup_intent)\n-\n[process_config[moto]](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_setup_intent#process_setup_intent-process_config)\n- [verifying the reader\nstate](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/collect-card-payment?terminal-sdk-platform=server-driven&reader=wpe#verify-reader)\n-\n[PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-payment_method)",
