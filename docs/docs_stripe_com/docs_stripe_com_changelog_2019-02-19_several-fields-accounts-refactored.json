  "content": "# Several account fields have been refactored to better describe legal entity, verification status and requirements, and configurable settingsBreaking changes\n\n## What’s new\n\nIncludes multiple changes:\n\n- Replaces the `legal_entity` property on the Account API resource with\n`individual`, `company`, and `business_type`.\n- Replaces the `verification` hash with a `requirements` hash.\n- Replaces the `verification[fields_needed]` array with three arrays to better\nrepresent when information is required: `requirements[eventually_due]`,\n`requirements[currently_due]`, and `requirements[past_due]`.\n- Renames `verification[due_by]` to `requirements[current_deadline]`.\n- Renames the `disabled_reason` enum value of `fields_needed` to\n`requirements.past_due`.\n- Moves properties on the `Account` object that configure behavior within Stripe\ninto the new `settings` hash.\n- Moves the `payout_schedule`, `payout_statement_descriptor` and\n`debit_negative_balances` fields to `settings[payouts]`, renaming them to\n`schedule`, `statement_descriptor` and `debit_negative_balances`.\n- Moves the `statement_descriptor` field to\n`settings[payments][statement_descriptor]`.\n- Moves `decline_charge_on` fields to `settings[card_payments]`, renaming it to\n`decline_on`.\n- Moves the `business_logo`, `business_logo_large` and `business_primary_color`\nfields to `settings[branding]`, renaming them to `icon`, `logo` and\n`primary_color`. Additionally, the `icon` field requires the image file you\nupload to be a square.\n- Moves the `display_name` and `timezone` fields to `settings[dashboard]`.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis change significantly restructures the Account API resource, providing a\nmore structured and detailed approach to account information and settings. You\nneed to extensively update your code that interacts with the Account API.\n\n## Upgrade\n\n- [View your current API\nversion](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#view-your-api-version-and-the-latest-available-upgrade-in-workbench)\nin Workbench.\n- If you use an SDK, upgrade to the corresponding SDK version for this API\nversion.- If you don’t use an SDK, update your [API\nrequests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/versioning) to include `Stripe-Version:\n2019-02-19`\n- Upgrade the API version used for [webhook\nendpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks/versioning).\n- [Test your integration](https://docs.stripe.com/testing) against the new\nversion.\n- If you use Connect, [test your Connect\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/testing).\n- In Workbench, [perform the\nupgrade](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#perform-the-upgrade).
