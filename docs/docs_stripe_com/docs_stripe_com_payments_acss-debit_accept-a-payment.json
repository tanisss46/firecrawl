We\nrecommend that you configure your payment methods from the Stripe Dashboard\nusing the instructions in [Accept a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web&ui=stripe-hosted).\n\nIf you want to continue manually configuring the payment methods you present to\nyour customers with Checkout, use this guide. Otherwise, update your integration\nto [configure payment methods in the\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/dashboard-payment-methods).\n\nAccepting Canadian pre-authorized debit (PAD) payments on your website consists\nof creating an object to track a payment, collecting payment method information\nand mandate acknowledgement, submitting the payment to Stripe for processing and\nverifying your customer’s bank account.\n\nWith Checkout, you can create a Checkout Session with `acss_debit` as a payment\nmethod type to track and handle the states of the payment until the payment\ncompletes.\n\n#### Note\n\nPre-authorized debit in Canada is a **delayed notification payment method**,\nwhich means that funds are not immediately available after payment. A payment\ntypically takes **5 business days** to arrive in your account.\n\n[Determine\ncompatibility](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/acss-debit/accept-a-payment#compatibility)\nTo support Canadian pre-authorized debit payments, a Checkout Session must\nsatisfy all of the following conditions:\n\n- You can only use one-time line items\n([subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating) are not\nyet supported in Checkout).\n- [Prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices) for all line items must be\nexpressed in Canadian or US dollars (currency code `cad` or `usd`).\n- Prices for all line items must be in the same currency. If you have line items\nin different currencies, create separate Checkout Sessions for each currency.\n\n### Presentment currency\n\nMost bank accounts in Canada hold Canadian dollars (CAD), with a small number of\naccounts in other currencies, including US dollars (USD). It is possible to\naccept PAD payments in either CAD or USD, but choosing the correct currency for\nyour customer is important to avoid payment failures.\n\nUnlike many card-based payment methods, you might not be able to successfully\ndebit a CAD account in USD or debit a USD account in CAD. Most often, attempting\nto do so results in a delayed payment failure that takes up to five business\ndays.\n\nTo avoid these failures, it is safest to take PAD payments in CAD unless you are\nconfident your customer’s account accepts USD debits.\n\n[Accept a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/acss-debit/accept-a-payment#accept-a-payment)\n#### Note\n\nBuild an integration to [accept a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?integration=checkout)\nwith Checkout before using this guide.\n\nThis guides you through enabling Canadian pre-authorized debit and shows the\ndifferences between accepting a card payment and using this payment method.\n\n### Enable Canadian pre-authorized debit as a payment method\n\nWhen creating a new [Checkout\nSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions), you need to:\n\n- Add `acss_debit` to the list of `payment_method_types`.\n- Make sure all your `line_items` use the `cad` currency.\n- Specify additional\n[payment_method_options](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-payment_method_options-acss_debit)\nparameters to describe your transaction. Learn more below.\n\nPayments must specify a [payment\nschedule](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-payment_method_options-acss_debit-mandate_options-payment_schedule)\nfor customers to authorize when checking out. See [PAD\nMandates](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/acss-debit#mandates) for details on\nhow to choose the right mandate options for your business:\n\nParameterValueRequired?`payment_method_options[acss_debit][mandate_options][payment_schedule]`The\nmandate payment schedule. Accepted values are `interval`, `sporadic`, or\n`combined`.

In the uncommon case\nthat the customer opts for micro-deposit verification, Stripe automatically\nsends two small deposits to the provided bank account which take 1-2 business\ndays to appear on the customer’s online bank statement. When the deposits are\nexpected to arrive, the customer receives an email with a link to confirm these\namounts and verify the bank account with Stripe. Once completed, the payment\nbegins processing.\n\n### Fulfill your orders\n\nAfter accepting a payment, learn how to [fulfill\norders](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/fulfillment).\n\n[Test your\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/acss-debit/accept-a-payment#test-integration)\n### Receive micro-deposit verification email\n\nIn order to receive the micro-deposit verification email in test mode after\ncollecting the bank account details and accepting a mandate, provide an email in\nthe `payment_method[billing_details][email]` field in the form of\n`{any_prefix}+test_email@{any_domain}` when confirming the payment method\ndetails.\n\n### Test account numbers\n\nStripe provides several test account numbers you can use to make sure your\nintegration for manually-entered bank accounts is ready for production. All test\naccounts that automatically succeed or fail the payment must be verified using\nthe test micro-deposit amounts below before they can be completed.\n\nInstitution NumberTransit NumberAccount\nNumberScenario`000``11000``000123456789`Succeeds the payment immediately after\nmicro-deposits are verified.`000``11000``900123456789`Succeeds the payment with\na three-minute delay after micro-deposits are\nverified.`000``11000``000222222227`Fails the payment immediately after\nmicro-deposits are verified.`000``11000``900222222227`Fails the payment with a\nthree-minute delay after micro-deposits are\nverified.`000``11000``000666666661`Fails to send verification\nmicro-deposits.`000``11000``000777777771`Fails the payment due to the payment\namount causing the account to exceed its weekly payment volume\nlimit.`000``11000``000888888881`Fails the payment due to the payment amount\nexceeding the account’s transaction limit.\nTo mimic successful or failed bank account verifications in test mode, use these\nmeaningful amounts for micro-deposits:\n\nMicro-deposit ValuesScenario`32` and `45`Successfully verifies the account.Any\nother number combinationsFails account verification.[Handle refunds and\ndisputes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/acss-debit/accept-a-payment#refunds-and-disputes)\nThe refund period for Canadian pre-authorized debit is up to 180 days after the\noriginal payment.\n\nCustomers can dispute a payment through their bank up to 90 calendar days after\nthe original payment and there is no appeals process.\n\nLearn more about [Canadian pre-authorized debit\ndisputes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/acss-debit#disputed-payments).\n\n## Additional considerations\n\n### Microdeposit verification failure\n\nWhen a bank account is pending verification with micro-deposits, it is possible\nfor the customer to fail to verify for two reasons:\n\n- The micro-deposits failed to send to the customer’s bank account (usually\nindicates a closed/unavailable bank account or incorrect bank account number).\n- The customer made three failed verification for the account. Exceeding this\nlimit means the bank account can no longer be verified or reused.\n- The customer failed to verify the bank account within 10 days.\n\nIf the bank account fails verification for one of these reasons, you can [handle\nthe checkout.session.async_payment_failed\nevent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types?event_types-invoice.payment_succeeded=#event_types-checkout.session.async_payment_failed)\nto contact the customer about placing a new order.\n\n[OptionalInstant only\nverificationServer-side](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/acss-debit/accept-a-payment#checkout-instant-only)[OptionalMicro-deposit\nonly\nverificationServer-side](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/acss-debit/accept-a-payment#checkout-microdeposit-only)[OptionalConfigure\ncustomer debit\ndateServer-side](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/acss-debit/accept-a-payment#web-target-date)\n## See also\n\n- [More about pre-authorized debit in\nCanada](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/acss-debit)\n- [Managing mandates](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/acss-debit#mandates)\n- [Checkout fulfillment](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/fulfillment)\n- [Customizing\nCheckout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/customization)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Accept a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web&ui=stripe-hosted)\n- [configure payment methods in the\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/dashboard-payment-methods)\n- [subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating)\n- [Prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices)\n- [accept a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?integration=checkout)\n- [Checkout Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions)\n-\n[payment_method_options](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-payment_method_options-acss_debit)\n- [payment\nschedule](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-payment_method_options-acss_debit-mandate_options-payment_schedule)\n- [PAD Mandates](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/acss-debit#mandates)\n- [https://example.com/success](https://example.com/success)\n- [https://example.com/cancel](https://example.com/cancel)\n- [fulfill orders](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/fulfillment)\n- [Canadian pre-authorized debit\ndisputes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/acss-debit#disputed-payments)\n- [handle the checkout.session.async_payment_failed\nevent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types?event_types-invoice.payment_succeeded=#event_types-checkout.session.async_payment_failed)\n- [More about pre-authorized debit in\nCanada](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/acss-debit)\n- [Customizing\nCheckout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/customization)",
