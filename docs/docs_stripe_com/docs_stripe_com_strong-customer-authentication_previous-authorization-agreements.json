Even if they\nauthenticated in the past, SCA may require your customer to come back online and\nre-authenticate. To reduce friction in these off-session payments, Stripe APIs\nenable upfront authentication—so you can authenticate your customer on-session\nonce and reuse the card off-session repeatedly. As of September 14, 2019, you\nneed to use these APIs to reduce the chance of failed payments when [reusing\ncards](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-and-reuse) or [creating\nsubscriptions and\ninvoices](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication).\n\nHowever, you can use previous authorization agreements for off-session payments\nthat meet the following criteria:\n\n- Cards from EU customers saved before December 31, 2020\n- Cards from UK customers saved before September 14, 2021\n\nThis means you don’t have to use Stripe’s new APIs to set up saved cards again,\nand your off-session payments can proceed normally—without re-authentication\nfrom customers.\n\n## How it works\n\nYou can use previous authorization agreements for all off-session payments that\nmeet both of these conditions, regardless of payment amount and frequency:\n\n- You saved the card details before the\n[eligibility](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication/previous-authorization-agreements#eligibility)\ncutoff\n- You explicitly tell Stripe the transaction is off-session\n\nStripe automatically looks for a transaction made with the card prior to the\neligibility cutoff. If found, Stripe uses the previous authorization agreement\nfor the current transaction. If the bank accepts the previous authorization\nagreement, the transaction is categorized as out of scope for SCA and can\nproceed without additional authentication.\n\nIf the bank declines the previous authorization agreement, it’s like any other\nPaymentIntent failing the confirmation step. The PaymentIntent’s [status\nchanges](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-and-reuse?platform=web&ui=elements#charge-saved-payment-method)\nto [requires_payment_method](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#2019-02-11), and\nyou have to [notify your customer to complete the\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-and-reuse?platform=web&ui=elements#charge-saved-payment-method).\n\n## Saving cards after the eligibility period\n\nNow that SCA has taken effect, [save and reuse\ncards](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-and-reuse) with the Payment Intents\nand [Setup Intents APIs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents) to qualify\nfor off-session exemptions. You can also save cards using [Stripe\nCheckout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-and-reuse?platform=checkout).\n\n## Preparing your saved cards for SCA\n\nFor Stripe to reuse authorization agreements, you need to use PaymentIntents and\ntell Stripe the payment is off-session.\n\nHow you saved the card before the eligibility cutoffWhat to do after the\neligibility periodBy passing a [token](https://docs.stripe.com/saving-cards),\n[source](https://docs.stripe.com/sources/cards), or [payment\nmethod](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-during-payment) to the\n`Customer`Create a PaymentIntent with [off-session\nflag](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-and-reuse?platform=web&ui=elements#charge-saved-payment-method)By\ncreating a [SetupIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-and-reuse) or\nusing\n[setup_future_usage](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-setup_future_usage)\nin a PaymentIntentCreate a PaymentIntent with [off-session\nflag](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-and-reuse?platform=web&ui=elements#charge-saved-payment-method)\nFor [subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating) and\n[invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices) managed with Stripe Billing,\nrefer to the [Billing SCA\nguide](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication#previous-agreements).\n\n## See also\n\n- [Payment Intents Overview](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents)\n- [Payment Intents Migration\nGuide](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents/migration)\n\n## Links\n\n- [update your Stripe\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication#preparing)\n- [Strong Customer\nAuthentication](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication)\n- [reusing cards](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-and-reuse)\n- [creating subscriptions and\ninvoices](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication)\n- [status\nchanges](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-and-reuse?platform=web&ui=elements#charge-saved-payment-method)\n- [requires_payment_method](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#2019-02-11)\n- [Setup Intents APIs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents)\n- [Stripe\nCheckout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-and-reuse?platform=checkout)\n- [token](https://docs.stripe.com/saving-cards)\n- [source](https://docs.stripe.com/sources/cards)\n- [payment method](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-during-payment)\n-\n[setup_future_usage](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-setup_future_usage)\n- [subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating)\n- [invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n- [Billing SCA\nguide](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication#previous-agreements)\n- [Payment Intents Overview](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents)\n- [Payment Intents Migration\nGuide](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents/migration)",
