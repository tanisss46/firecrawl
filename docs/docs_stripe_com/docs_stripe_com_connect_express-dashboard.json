They can use the Express Dashboard to monitor their\navailable balance, view upcoming [payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts), and\ntrack their earnings in real time. This guide outlines the features of the\nExpress Dashboard and how your connected accounts can access it.\n\n## Express Dashboard features\n\nThe Express Dashboard displays the connected account’s balance transactions and\nnet volume.\n\n### Transactions list\n\nThe **Transactions** list displays a connected account’s balance transactions,\nincluding charges, transfers, and payouts. The **Transactions** list organizes\neach transaction by type, date, and amount. By default, it displays generic\ndescriptions of charges and transfers, such as `Payment from {YOUR PLATFORM}`.\nTo learn how to create custom descriptions, see [Customize the Express\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/customize-express-dashboard).\n\n### Earnings chart\n\nThe **Earnings** chart displays the net volume of the account’s charges and\ntransfers over time. They can select different time intervals to view.\n\n## Accessing the Express Dashboard\n\nThere are two ways to access the Express Dashboard, login links and\nself-service. We recommend using login links.\n\n### Platform login links\n\nYou can generate single-use account-specific login links that redirect connected\naccounts from your platform application to the Express Dashboard login page.\nThey then log into the Dashboard using SMS authentication.\n\nTo learn about using login links, see [Integrate the Express Dashboard in your\nplatform](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/integrate-express-dashboard).\n\n### Self-serve access\n\nConnected accounts can access the Express Dashboard by logging into [Stripe\nExpress](https://connect.stripe.com/express_login) using their account email and\nSMS authentication.\n\n#### Note\n\nOnly live mode accounts can log into Stripe Express. For testing, use [login\nlinks](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/integrate-express-dashboard).\n\nTo learn more about self-serve access, see the [Stripe Express support\narticle](https://support.stripe.com/express/questions/how-do-i-login-to-my-stripe-express-account).\n\n## Supported browsers\n\nThe Express Dashboard supports the same browsers that the [full Stripe Dashboard\nsupports](https://docs.stripe.com/dashboard/basics). Express users must access\nthe Dashboard in a web browser, not in embedded web views inside mobile or\ndesktop applications.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Integrate the Express\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/integrate-express-dashboard)\n- [Customize the Express\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/customize-express-dashboard)\n\n## Links\n\n- [configured with\nproperties](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/update-to-typeless-connect)\n- [payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts)\n- [Customize the Express\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/customize-express-dashboard)\n- [Integrate the Express Dashboard in your\nplatform](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/integrate-express-dashboard)\n- [Stripe Express](https://connect.stripe.com/express_login)\n- [Stripe Express support\narticle](https://support.stripe.com/express/questions/how-do-i-login-to-my-stripe-express-account)\n- [full Stripe Dashboard supports](https://docs.stripe.com/dashboard/basics)",
