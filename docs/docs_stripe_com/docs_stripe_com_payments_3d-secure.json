  "content": "# 3D Secure authentication\n\n## Reduce fraud and meet regulatory requirements through 3D Secure (3DS) authentication.\n\n[3D Secure](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure) (3DS) is an\nauthentication method that provides an additional layer of authentication for\ncredit card transactions, protecting against fraudulent actors. 3DS asks your\ncustomers to verify their identity with the card issuer during payment. In most\nscenarios, you direct your customer to a verification page on their bank’s site\nwhere they type in a password linked to the card or a code sent to their phone.\nCustomers might recognize this method through the card networks’ brand names,\nlike Visa Secure and Mastercard Identity Check.\n\nThe [Strong Customer\nAuthentication](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication)\nregulation, as part of PSD2 in Europe and similar regulations in the UK, India,\nJapan, and Australia, might require using 3DS for card payments. 3DS is optional\nin other regions but you can still use it as a tool to reduce fraud.\n\n[Authenticate with 3D Secure nativelyIntegrate 3D Secure (3DS) into your\ncheckout\nflow.](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure/authentication-flow)[SCA\nExemptionsUse SCA exemptions and Data Only to reduce cardholder friction on\neligible\ntransactions.](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure/strong-customer-authentication-exemptions)[Standalone\n3D SecureRun 3D Secure on Stripe while processing the subsequent payment on a\nthird-party\ngateway.](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure/standalone-three-d-secure)[Import\n3D Secure resultsProcess payments when 3D Secure (3DS) runs outside of\nStripe.](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents/three-d-secure-import)[Payment\nanalyticsLearn how 3D Secure affects your payment success rate in the\nDashboard.](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/analytics)\n\n## Links\n\n- [3D Secure](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure)\n- [Strong Customer\nAuthentication](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication)\n- [Authenticate with 3D Secure nativelyIntegrate 3D Secure (3DS) into your\ncheckout flow.](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure/authentication-flow)\n- [SCA ExemptionsUse SCA exemptions and Data Only to reduce cardholder friction\non eligible\ntransactions.](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure/strong-customer-authentication-exemptions)\n- [Standalone 3D SecureRun 3D Secure on Stripe while processing the subsequent\npayment on a third-party\ngateway.](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure/standalone-three-d-secure)\n- [Import 3D Secure resultsProcess payments when 3D Secure (3DS) runs outside of\nStripe.](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents/three-d-secure-import)\n- [Payment analyticsLearn how 3D Secure affects your payment success rate in the\nDashboard.](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/analytics)",
