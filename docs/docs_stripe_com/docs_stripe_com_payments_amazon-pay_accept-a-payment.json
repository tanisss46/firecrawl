We\nrecommend that you configure your payment methods from the Stripe Dashboard\nusing the instructions in [Accept a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web&ui=stripe-hosted).\n\nIf you want to continue manually configuring the payment methods you present to\nyour customers with Checkout, use this guide. Otherwise, update your integration\nto [configure payment methods in the\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/dashboard-payment-methods).\n\nAmazon Pay is a\n[single-use](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#usage) payment\nmethod where customers are required to\n[authenticate](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#customer-actions)\ntheir payment. Customers are redirected from your website or app, authorize the\npayment with Amazon, then return to your website or app. You get [immediate\nnotification](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#payment-notification)\nof whether the payment succeeded or failed.\n\n[Determine\ncompatibility](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/amazon-pay/accept-a-payment#compatibility)\nTo support Amazon Pay payments, a Checkout Session must satisfy all of the\nfollowing conditions:\n\n- [Prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices) for all line items must be in the\nsame currency.- If you have line items in different currencies, create separate\nCheckout Sessions for each currency.\n[Accept a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/amazon-pay/accept-a-payment#accept-a-payment)\n#### Note\n\nBuild an integration to [accept a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?integration=checkout)\nwith Checkout before using this guide.\n\nThis guide describes how to enable Amazon Pay and shows the differences between\naccepting a card payment and using Amazon Pay.\n\n### Enable Amazon Pay as a payment method\n\nWhen creating a new [Checkout\nSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions), you need to:\n\n- Add `amazon_pay` to the list of `payment_method_types`.\n- Make sure all `line_items` use the same currency.\n\n```\nStripe::Checkout::Session.create({\n mode: 'payment',\n payment_method_types: ['card'],\n payment_method_types: ['card', 'amazon_pay'],\n line_items: [{\n price_data: {\n currency: 'usd',\n product_data: {\n name: 'T-shirt',\n },\n unit_amount: 2000,\n },\n quantity: 1,\n }],\n success_url: 'https://example.com/success',\n cancel_url: 'https://example.com/cancel',\n})\n```\n\n### Fulfill your orders\n\nAfter accepting a payment, learn how to [fulfill\norders](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/fulfillment).\n\n[Test your\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/amazon-pay/accept-a-payment#test-integration)\nWhen testing your Checkout integration, select Amazon Pay as the payment method\nand click the **Pay** button.\n\n!\n\n## See also\n\n- [More about Amazon Pay](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/amazon-pay)\n- [Checkout fulfillment](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/fulfillment)\n- [Customizing\nCheckout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/customization)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Accept a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web&ui=stripe-hosted)\n- [configure payment methods in the\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/dashboard-payment-methods)\n- [single-use](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#usage)\n-\n[authenticate](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#customer-actions)\n- [immediate\nnotification](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#payment-notification)\n- [Prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices)\n- [accept a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?integration=checkout)\n- [Checkout Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions)\n- [https://example.com/success](https://example.com/success)\n- [https://example.com/cancel](https://example.com/cancel)\n- [fulfill orders](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/fulfillment)\n- [More about Amazon Pay](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/amazon-pay)\n- [Customizing\nCheckout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/customization)",
