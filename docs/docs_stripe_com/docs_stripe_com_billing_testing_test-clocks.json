When you use test clocks you simulate the forward movement of time in\n[test mode](https://docs.stripe.com/test-mode), which causes Billing resources,\nlike Subscriptions, to change state and trigger\n[webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) events. This means that, for\nexample, you donâ€™t have to wait a year to see how your integration handles a\npayment failure for a quarterly or annual renewal.\n\nHere are some other things you can do with test clocks:\n\n- Test complex simulations such as upgrading or changing plans mid-cycle.\n- Ensure your integration processes Billing lifecycle webhooks correctly.\n- Validate that your app handles trials correctly.\n- Build and test multi-phase subscription schedules.\n\n## How to use test clocks\n\n[Simulate subscriptionsLearn how to simulate subscriptions in test\nmode.](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/testing/test-clocks/simulate-subscriptions)[API\nand advanced usageLearn advanced strategies for using test clocks in the\nDashboard and\nAPI.](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/testing/test-clocks/api-advanced-usage)\n\n## Links\n\n- [test mode](https://docs.stripe.com/test-mode)\n- [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks)\n- [Simulate subscriptionsLearn how to simulate subscriptions in test\nmode.](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/testing/test-clocks/simulate-subscriptions)\n- [API and advanced usageLearn advanced strategies for using test clocks in the\nDashboard and\nAPI.](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/testing/test-clocks/api-advanced-usage)",
