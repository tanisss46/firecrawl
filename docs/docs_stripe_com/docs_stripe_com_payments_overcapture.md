# Capture more than the authorized amount on a payment

## Use overcapture to capture more than the authorized amount for a PaymentIntent.

Stripe-hosted pageEmbedded formAdvanced integration
Overcapture allows you to capture with an amount that’s higher than the
authorized amount for a card payment. Unlike [incremental
authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/incremental-authorization),
overcapture doesn’t result in additional authorizations with the card networks.
When you overcapture a PaymentIntent, your customer won’t see any immediate
updates on their credit card statement. After the captured amount settles, the
initial pending authorization gets updated with the final captured amount.

## Availability

When using overcapture, be aware of the following restrictions:

- Only available with Visa, Mastercard, American Express, or Discover.
- Only eligible for online card payments. For in-person card payments see how to
[collect
tips](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/collecting-tips/overview).
- Card brands limit the amount that you can overcapture (generally calculated as
a percentage of the authorized amount), and impose additional constraints,
including country, card type, and merchant category restrictions (see below).
-
[mode](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-mode)
is set to `payment` and
[capture_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-payment_intent_data-capture_method)
is set to `manual` on the
[CheckoutSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/)

#### IC+ feature

We offer overcapture to users on [IC+
pricing](https://support.stripe.com/questions/understanding-blended-interchange-pricing).
If you’re on standard Stripe pricing and want access to this feature, learn more

### Networks with limited support (beta)

### Overcapture with Strong Customer Authentication (SCA)

If you and the cardholder are in a country that has Strong Customer
Authentication (SCA) requirements, keep in mind the limitations of overcapture
availability.

- Under SCA requirements, you generally need to authenticate an amount that’s
greater than or equal to the amount that you eventually capture. For this
reason, you need to authenticate and authorize for the highest estimated amount
that you plan to capture, rather than using overcapture as outlined elsewhere on
this page. Subsequently, you can capture up to the full amount authenticated,
depending on the total amount for the goods or services provided. If you find it
necessary to capture an amount beyond the originally authorized and
authenticated amount, you must cancel the original payment and create a new one
with the correct amount. However, there are some exceptions to this requirement
(see below).
- There are a number of [transaction
exemptions](https://support.stripe.com/questions/transaction-exemptions-for-strong-customer-authentication-%28sca%29)
for SCA where overcapture might be permissible. For example, merchant-initiated
transactions (MIT) where the customer isn’t physically present during the
checkout flow are potentially exempt. See [when to categorize a transaction as
MIT](https://support.stripe.com/questions/merchant-initiated-transactions-(mits)-when-to-categorize-a-transaction-as-mit).

You need to familiarize yourself with the complete documentation to gain a
comprehensive understanding of overcapture and SCA requirements. See our [SCA
guide](https://stripe.com/guides/strong-customer-authentication) for more
information.

You can use the
[custom_text](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-custom_text)
field when creating a new
[CheckoutSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout_sessions) to display
additional text on the checkout page to help meet compliance requirements.

#### Compliance

You’re responsible for your compliance with all applicable laws, regulations,
and network rules when using overcapture. Make sure to review the rules for the
card networks that you plan to use this feature with to make sure your sales
comply with the applicable rules, which vary by network. For example, some card
networks don’t allow overcapture for transactions where the final transaction
amount should be known at the time of authorization.

The information provided on this page relating to your compliance with these
requirements is for your general guidance, and isn’t legal, tax, accounting, or
other professional advice. Consult with a professional if you’re unsure about
your obligations.

[Create a Checkout
Session](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/overcapture#create-and-confirm)
Add a checkout button to your website that calls a server-side endpoint to
create a [Checkout
Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create).

```
<html>
 <head>
 <title>Buy cool new product</title>
 </head>
 <body>
<!-- Use action="/create-checkout-session.php" if your server is PHP based. -->
 <form action="/create-checkout-session" method="POST">
 <button type="submit">Checkout</button>
 </form>
 </body>
</html>
```

A Checkout Session is the programmatic representation of what your customer sees
when they’re redirected to the payment form. You can configure it with options
such as:

- [Line
items](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-line_items)
to charge
- Currencies to use

You must populate `success_url` with the URL of a page on your website that
Checkout returns your customer to after they complete the payment. You can
optionally also provide a `cancel_url` of a page on your website that Checkout
returns your customer to if they terminate the payment process before
completion.

#### Note

Checkout Sessions expire 24 hours after creation by default.

After creating a Checkout Session, redirect your customer to the
[URL](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object#checkout_session_object-url)
returned in the response.

To enable the overcapture feature, set
[request_overcapture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-payment_method_options-card-request_overcapture)
to `if_available`.

```
# This example sets up an endpoint using the Sinatra framework.
# Watch this video to get started: https://youtu.be/8aA9Enb8NVc.

require 'json'
require 'sinatra'
require 'stripe'

# Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.
# See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
Stripe.api_key = 'sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2'

post '/create-checkout-session' do
 session = Stripe::Checkout::Session.create({
 line_items: [{
 price_data: {
 currency: 'usd',
 product_data: {
 name: 'T-shirt',
 },
 unit_amount: 2000,
 },
 quantity: 1,
 }],
 payment_method_options: {
 card: {
 request_overcapture: 'if_available',
 },
 },
 mode: 'payment',
 # These placeholder URLs will be replaced in a following step.
 success_url: 'https://example.com/success',
 cancel_url: 'https://example.com/cancel',
 })

 redirect session.url, 303
end
```

After the customer completes checkout, look at the
[overcapture.status](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-payment_method_details-card-overcapture)
field on the [latest_charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object) in the
[PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object#checkout_session_object-payment_intent)
to determine if overcapture is available for the payment based on
[availability](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/overcapture#availability). If
`available`, the
[maximum_amount_capturable](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-payment_method_details-card-overcapture-maximum_amount_capturable)
field indicates the maximum amount capturable for the PaymentIntent. If
`unavailable`, the maximum_amount_capturable is the amount authorized.

```
// PaymentIntent response
{
 "id": "pi_xxx",
 "object": "payment_intent",
 "amount": 1000,
 "amount_capturable": 1000,
 "amount_received": 0,
 "status": "requires_capture",
 ...
 // if latest_charge is expanded
 "latest_charge": {
 "id": "ch_xxx",
 "object": "charge",
 "payment_method_details": {
 "card": {
 "amount_authorized": 1000
 "overcapture": {
 "status": "available", // or "unavailable"
 "maximum_amount_capturable": 1200
 }
 }
 }
 ...
 }
 ...
}
```

[Capture the
PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/overcapture#capture-payment-intent)
To capture more than the currently authorized amount on a PaymentIntent, use the
[capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/capture) endpoint and
provide an
[amount_to_capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/capture#capture_payment_intent-amount_to_capture)
up to the
[maximum_amount_capturable](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-payment_method_details-card-overcapture).

If you need to capture an amount larger than the `maximum_amount_capturable`,
perform an [incremental
authorization](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/incremental-authorization) to
increase the authorized amount, where available.

```
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents/pi_xxx/capture \
 -u "sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:" \
 -d amount_to_capture=1200 \
 -d "expand[]"=latest_charge
```

The
[amount_capturable](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-amount_capturable)
and
[amount_received](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-amount_received)
fields update accordingly in the PaymentIntent capture response for a successful
overcapture. The captured PaymentIntent that returns has an updated
[amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-amount)
to reflect the total monetary amount moved for this payment. Use the
[amount_authorized](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-payment_method_details-card-amount_authorized)
field on the associated Charge to reference the initial amount authorized for a
successfully overcaptured payment.

```
// PaymentIntent response
{
 "id": "pi_xxx",
 "object": "payment_intent",
 "amount": 1200,
 "amount_capturable": 0,
 "amount_received": 1200,
 "status": "succeeded",
 ...
 // if latest_charge is expanded
 "latest_charge": {
 "id": "ch_xxx",
 "object": "charge",
 "payment_method_details": {
 "card": {
 "amount_authorized": 1000,
 "overcapture": {
 "maximum_amount_capturable": 1200,
 "status": "available" // or "unavailable"
 }
 }
 }
 ...
 }
 ...
}
```

## Test your integration

Use any of the below Stripe test cards with any CVC and future expiration date
to request and perform overcaptures while in test mode. If overcapture is
available on payments for a given network in test mode, it’s also available in
live mode.
