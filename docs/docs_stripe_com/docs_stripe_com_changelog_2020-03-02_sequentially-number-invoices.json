  "content": "# Invoices can now be numbered sequentially across your accountBreaking changes\n\n## What’s new\n\nYou can now optionally number invoices [sequentially across your\naccount](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/customize#account-numbering) instead\nof sequentially for each customer. To use this feature, enable [account level\nnumbering](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/invoice) in the Stripe\nDashboard. To ensure invoices are numbered sequentially and without gaps,\ninvoices that can be deleted (drafts) are only assigned numbers when finalized.\n\n## Impact\n\nLets you configure your Stripe account to number invoices sequentially across\nthe entire account, rather than sequentially for each individual customer. This\nprovides more flexibility and control over invoice numbering, as you can now\nmaintain a consistent, unified sequence of invoice numbers across your business.\n\n## Upgrade\n\n- [View your current API\nversion](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#view-your-api-version-and-the-latest-available-upgrade-in-workbench)\nin Workbench.\n- If you use an SDK, upgrade to the corresponding SDK version for this API\nversion.- If you don’t use an SDK, update your [API\nrequests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/versioning) to include `Stripe-Version:\n2020-03-02`\n- Upgrade the API version used for [webhook\nendpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks/versioning).\n- [Test your integration](https://docs.stripe.com/testing) against the new\nversion.\n- If you use Connect, [test your Connect\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/testing).\n- In Workbench, [perform the\nupgrade](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#perform-the-upgrade).
