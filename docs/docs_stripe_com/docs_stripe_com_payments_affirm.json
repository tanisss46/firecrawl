Pay in 4 interest-free installments or in monthly installments of up\nto 36 months.\n\nTo pay with Affirm, customers are redirected to Affirm’s site, where they\n[authorize](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#customer-actions)\nthe payment by agreeing to the terms of a payment plan, then return to your\nwebsite to complete the order. Affirm offers payment options based on factors\nsuch as customer credit, prior account history, order amount, and the type of\ngoods or services being underwritten. After payment acceptance, the full amount\nof the order (minus fees) is made available to your Stripe account upfront, and\nAffirm collects the purchase amount from your customer, who repays Affirm\ndirectly over time.\n\nPayment method propertiesBusiness locationsProduct support- **Customer\nlocations**\n\nUnited States, Canada\n- **Presentment currency**\n\nUSD or CAD\n- **Payment confirmation**\n\nCustomer-initiated\n- **Payment method family**\n\nBuy now, pay later\n- **Recurring payments**\n\nNo\n- **Payout timing**\n\nStandard\n- **Connect support**\n\nYes\n- **Dispute support**\n\n[Yes, by email from\nStripe](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/affirm#disputes-and-fraud)\n- **Manual capture support**\n\nYes\n- **Refunds / Partial refunds**\n\n[Yes / Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/affirm#refunds)\n\n#### Note\n\nAffirm only supports domestic transactions, meaning you can only sell to\ncustomers in the same country as your business. If you’re using [Dynamic payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/dynamic-payment-methods),\nStripe handles a customer’s payment method eligibility automatically. If you use\n[payment_method_types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-payment_method_types),\nyou must either configure your integration so that it only presents Affirm to\neligible customers, or use dynamic payment methods.\n\n## Payment flow\n\nBelow is a demonstration of the Affirm payment flow from your checkout page:\n\n## Get started\n\nYou don’t have to integrate Affirm and other payment methods individually. If\nyou use our front-end products, Stripe automatically determines the most\nrelevant payment methods to display. Go to the [Stripe\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and enable\nAffirm. To get started with one of our hosted UIs, follow a quickstart:\n\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart): Our prebuilt, hosted\ncheckout page.\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart): Our drop-in UI\ncomponents.\n\n[Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links) also supports adding\nAffirm from the Dashboard.\n\nIf you prefer to manually list payment methods, learn how to [manually configure\nAffirm as a payment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/affirm/accept-a-payment).\n\nYou can also let customers know Affirm payments are available by including the\n[Payment Method Messaging\nElement](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-method-messaging) on your\nproduct, cart, and payment pages. We recommend adding a site messaging Element\nto help drive conversion.\n\n## Payment options\n\nDepending on the cart order size, Affirm presents customers with Pay in 4,\nmonthly installments, or both.\n\n- **Pay in 4**: customers pay for purchases in four or fewer interest-free,\nbi-weekly payments over an 8 week term. Available for cart sizes between $50 and\n$250*.\n- **Monthly Installments**: customers pay for purchases over a longer term of up\nto 36 months, which might include interest. Available for cart sizes between 100\nUSD and 30,000 USD*.\n\n* Term lengths and cart ranges are determined by Affirm and might change at\ntheir discretion.\n\n## Prohibited and restricted business categories\n\nIn addition to the categories of [businesses restricted from using Stripe\noverall](https://stripe.com/restricted-businesses), the following categories are\nprohibited from using Affirm.\n\n- Business to business services\n- Home improvement services, including contractors and special trade contractors\n- Titled goods and auto loans, including entire cars, boats, and other motor\nvehicles (parts and services allowed)\n- Professional services (including legal, consulting, and accounting)\n- NFTs\n- Pre-orders\n\nHealthcare services are approved to use Affirm, however they’re subject to\nadditional requirements. For the complete list of prohibited businesses and\nadditional requirements, see [the Affirm Payment\nTerms](https://stripe.com/legal/affirm).\n\n## Add Affirm branding to your website\n\nUse the [Payment Method Messaging\nElement](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-method-messaging) on your site\nto let customers know that you offer Affirm ahead of checkout. You must comply\nwith Affirm’s [marketing compliance\nguides](https://docs.affirm.com/developers/docs/compliance_and_guidelines) and\nuse the Affirm\n[guide](https://businesshub.affirm.com/hc/en-us/articles/10653174159636-Affirm-Marketing-Compliance-Guides)\nthat relates to the Affirm payment options you offer your customers.\n\n## Refunds\n\nReturns are subject to the return policy that you display on your website. If\nyour business allows returns, you can [refund](https://docs.stripe.com/refunds)\nAffirm transactions as you normally would for card payments. Affirm supports\npartial or full refunds for up to 120 days after the original purchase, and\nprocesses them asynchronously. After Stripe initiates a refund, Affirm pauses\nthe customer’s payment plan and refunds the customer for any payments they’ve\nalready made, minus any interest paid. Stripe doesn’t credit back the processing\nfees in the event of a refund.\n\n## Disputes\n\nCustomers must authenticate Affirm payments by logging into their Affirm\naccount. This requirement helps reduce the risk of fraud or unrecognized\npayments. While Affirm covers losses incurred from customer fraud, Stripe might\ncontact you on behalf of Affirm and request to stop or pause shipment before any\nlosses are incurred. Comply promptly with these requests.\n\nCustomers can dispute Affirm payments in certain cases—for example, if they\nreceive faulty goods or don’t receive them at all. Customers can file a dispute\nafter the date of purchase and there isn’t a time limitation for filing. The\ndispute process works like this:\n\nAfter the customer initiates a dispute, Stripe notifies you using:\n\n- Email notification\n- Stripe Dashboard\n- An API `charge.dispute.created` event (if your integration is set up to\nreceive [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks))\n\nStripe holds back the disputed amount from your balance until Affirm resolves\nthe dispute, which can take a maximum of 30 calendar days from dispute creation.\n\nStripe requests that you upload compelling evidence that you fulfilled the\npurchase order [using the Stripe\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/responding#respond). This evidence\ncan include:\n\n- Received return confirmation (for shipped goods returned from the customer to\nyou)\n- Tracking ID\n- Shipping date\n- Record of purchase for intangible goods, such as IP address or email receipt\n- Record of purchase for services or physical goods, such as phone number or\nproof of receipt\n\nIf you prefer to handle disputes programmatically, you can [respond to disputes\nusing the API](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/api).\n\nThis information helps Affirm determine if a dispute is valid or if they should\nreject it. Make sure the evidence you provide contains as much detail as\npossible from what the customer provided at checkout. You must submit the\nrequested information within 15 calendar days. Affirm makes a decision within 15\ncalendar days of evidence submission. If Affirm resolves the dispute with you\nwinning, Stripe returns the disputed amount to your Stripe balance. If Affirm\nrules in favor of the customer, the balance charge becomes permanent.\n\n## Customer emails\n\nAfter a customer uses Affirm to make a purchase, Affirm emails the customer with\nupdates. These updates include information about the following events:\n\n- Affirm confirms or denies a loan. Affirms sends these updates when the\npayment_intent succeeds or when Affirm denies the loan.\n- A [refund](https://docs.stripe.com/refunds) completes.\n- A payment is cancelled, which results in Affirm cancellling the loan.\n- The customer completes a payment as part of the payment plan.\n\nAffirm only sends email updates about Affirm’s loan issuance to your customer.\nContinue to separately send emails related to the purchase such as order\nconfirmation and shipping updates.\n\n## Connect\n\nYou can use [Stripe Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect) with Affirm to\nprocess payments on behalf of a connected account.\n[Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect) users can use Affirm with the\nfollowing charge types:\n\n- [Direct](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges)\n- [Destination](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges)\n- [Separate Charges and\nTransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n### Request Affirm capability\n\nMake sure you\n[request](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities#requesting-unrequesting)\nthe `affirm_payments` capability and it’s set to `active` on both your platform\naccount and any connected accounts you want to enable.\n\n### Set correct MCC\n\nStripe and Affirm rely on merchant category codes (MCC) to determine eligibility\nof the connected accounts against the Affirm [prohibited business\ncategories](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/affirm#prohibited-and-restricted-business-categories).\nMake sure that you set [correct\nMCCs](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/setting-mcc) for your connected accounts\nthat use the Express Dashboard or a dashboard that isn’t hosted by Stripe.\n\n### Merchant of record\n\nThe [charge type](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges) of Connect payments\nmight change the merchant name that appears on Affirm’s website or app during\nthe redirect. The merchant of record determines the Stripe account authorized to\ncreate payments with a particular\n[PaymentMethod](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object).\n\n## Links\n\n- [Affirm](https://www.affirm.com/)\n- [pricing details](https://stripe.com/pricing/local-payment-methods)\n- [authorize](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#customer-actions)\n- [Yes, by email from\nStripe](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/affirm#disputes-and-fraud)\n- [Yes / Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/affirm#refunds)\n- [Dynamic payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/dynamic-payment-methods)\n-\n[payment_method_types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-payment_method_types)\n- [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods)\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart)\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart)\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n- [manually configure Affirm as a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/affirm/accept-a-payment)\n- [Payment Method Messaging\nElement](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-method-messaging)\n- [businesses restricted from using Stripe\noverall](https://stripe.com/restricted-businesses)\n- [the Affirm Payment Terms](https://stripe.com/legal/affirm)\n- [marketing compliance\nguides](https://docs.affirm.com/developers/docs/compliance_and_guidelines)\n-\n[guide](https://businesshub.affirm.com/hc/en-us/articles/10653174159636-Affirm-Marketing-Compliance-Guides)\n- [refund](https://docs.stripe.com/refunds)\n- [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks)\n- [using the Stripe\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/responding#respond)\n- [respond to disputes using the API](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/api)\n- [Stripe Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)\n- [Direct](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges)\n- [Destination](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges)\n- [Separate Charges and\nTransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n-\n[request](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities#requesting-unrequesting)\n- [prohibited business\ncategories](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/affirm#prohibited-and-restricted-business-categories)\n- [correct MCCs](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/setting-mcc)\n- [charge type](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges)\n- [PaymentMethod](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object)",
