However, Stripe\nCheckout is optimized for conversion, and adding extra information might affect\nyour conversion rate. You can bold text or insert a link using [Markdown\nsyntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).\n\n## Customize policies and contact information\n\nYou can display your return, refund, and legal policies, and your support\ncontact information to your customers on Checkout. Go to [Checkout\nSettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/checkout) to configure the\ninformation you want to display, including:\n\n- Details about your return and refund policies\n- Your support phone number, email, and website\n- Links to your terms of service and privacy policy\n\nPresenting this information can increase buyer confidence and minimize cart\nabandonment.\n\n### Configure support and legal policies\n\nFrom [Checkout Settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/checkout), add\nsupport contact information to your sessions by enabling **Contact\ninformation**. Similarly, add links to your **Terms of service** and **Privacy\npolicy** to your sessions by enabling **Legal policies**. If you require\ncustomers to implicitly consent to your legal policies when they complete their\ncheckout, select the **Display agreement to legal terms** checkbox.\n\nYou must add your support contact information and legal policy links in your\n[Public Detail Settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public).\n\nThe following previews show how Checkout displays a dialog with the support\ncontact information, links to the store legal policies, and information about\nthe payment terms.\n\n![A checkout page with contact\ninformation.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/contact-modal.2b81bc2e74657f7c94a45a743439c81f.png)\n\nPreview of contact information on Checkout.\n\n![A checkout page with legal\npolicies.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/legal-modal.9351cb51408c2a9f5c0ae23aab03e138.png)\n\nPreview of legal policies on Checkout.\n\n### Configure return and refund policies\n\nDisplay your return, refund, or exchange policies, by enabling **Return and\nRefund policies**. Although businesses that sell physical goods use return\npolicies, businesses that sell digital goods or customized physical goods\ntypically use refund policies. Because they’re not mutually exclusive, you can\nselect both options if your business sells both categories of goods. You can\nedit your return and refund details, including:\n\n- Whether you accept returns, refunds, or exchanges\n- Whether returns, refunds, or exchanges are free or if they’re subject to a fee\n- How many days after a purchase you’ll accept returns, refunds, or exchanges\n- How customers can return items shipped to them\n- Whether you accept in-store returns\n- A link to the full return and refund policy\n- A custom message\n\nIf you accept free returns, refunds, or exchanges, Checkout highlights the\npolicy for customers.\n\nThe following previews show how Checkout displays a return policy. In this\nexample, it’s for purchases that can be returned by shipping them or in-store\nfor a full refund (or exchange) for up to 60 days. You can display similar\ninformation for refunds.\n\n![Preview of return policies on\nCheckout](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/return-policy-modal.0c7a9ff71b8bc2c155842532801e06a8.png)\n\nPreview of return policies on Checkout.\n\n![Preview of a policy highlight on\nCheckout](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/policy-highlight.334828420693a33d376977a2c0fe5851.png)\n\nPreview of a policy highlight on Checkout.\n\n### Collect a terms of service agreement\n\nBusinesses often require their customers to agree to their terms of service\nbefore they can pay. This might depend on the type of product or subscription.\nCheckout helps you collect the necessary agreement by requiring a customer to\naccept your terms before paying.\n\n![Collect terms of service\nagreement](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/terms-of-service-consent-collection.dec90bde6d1a3c5d4c0b3e7b8e644a52.png)\n\nCollect terms of service agreement\n\nYou can collect a terms of service agreement with Stripe Checkout when you\ncreate a Session:\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/checkout/sessions \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d \"line_items[0][price]\"={{PRICE_ID}} \\\n -d \"line_items[0][quantity]\"=2 \\\n -d mode=payment \\\n --data-urlencode success_url=\"https://example.com/success\" \\\n --data-urlencode cancel_url=\"https://example.com/cancel\" \\\n -d \"consent_collection[terms_of_service]\"=required \\\n--data-urlencode \"custom_text[terms_of_service_acceptance][message]\"=\"I agree to\nthe [Terms of Service](https://example.com/terms)\"\n```\n\nWhen `consent_collection.terms_of_service='required'`, Checkout dynamically\ndisplays a checkbox for collecting the customer’s terms of service agreement. If\n`consent_collection.terms_of_service='none'`, Checkout won’t display the\ncheckbox and won’t require customers to accept the terms of service. Before\nrequiring agreement to your terms, set your terms of service URL in your [public\ndetails](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public) of your business. Setting\na privacy policy URL is optional—Checkout also links to your privacy policy when\na URL to your Privacy policy is set in your [public\ndetails](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public).\n\nAfter a customer completes checkout, you can verify that the customer accepted\nyour terms of service by looking at the Session object in the\n`checkout.session.completed` webhook, or by retrieving the Session using the\nAPI. When the terms are accepted, the Session’s\n[consent.terms_of_service](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object#checkout_session_object-consent)\nfield is set to `accepted`.\n\nYou can customize the text that appears next to the checkbox by using\n`custom_text.terms_of_service_acceptance`. You need to set\n`consent_collection.terms_of_service='required'`. To use your own terms, insert\na Markdown link. For example: `I agree to the [Terms of\nService](https://example.com/terms)`\n\n#### Warning\n\nConsult your legal and compliance advisors before making any changes to this\ntext. You can’t use this feature to display custom text that violates or creates\nambiguity with the Stripe-generated text on Checkout, obligations under your\nStripe agreement, Stripe policies, and applicable laws.\n\n### Collect consent for promotional emails\n\nYou can send promotional emails to inform customers of new products and to share\ncoupons and discounts. Before doing so, you must [collect their\nconsent](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/promotional-emails-consent)\nto receive promotional emails.\n\n## Customize payment method reuse agreement\n\nWhen a session is in either `setup` or `subscription` mode, or is in `payment`\nmode with `setup_future_usage` set, Checkout displays a message about reusing\nthe customer’s payment method. The message can include information specific to\nthe selected payment method. You can hide or customize the default text, but not\nthe payment method-specific text.\n\n![Default payment method reuse agreement display in subscription\nmode](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/default-subscription-mode-payment-method-reuse-agreement.caee311155d9948637a53aafded801af.png)\n\nDefault payment method reuse agreement in subscription mode\n\n#### Warning\n\nBy customizing this text, you’re responsible for maintaining compliance, which\nincludes updating this text as card network rules and local regulations change.\nDon’t use this feature without consulting with your legal team or setting custom\ntext that includes information regarding the reuse of the payment method. Make\nsure that your customized text covers all modes you plan to support.\n\nTo hide the payment method reuse agreement text, set\n`consent_collection.payment_method_reuse_agreement.position='hidden'`. Checkout\nwon’t display its default language governing the reuse of the payment method. To\nset your own text in place of Stripe’s default language, set\n`custom_text.after_submit.message`. You can also use `custom_text.submit` or\n`custom_text.terms_of_service_acceptance` to display your own version of this\nlanguage.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/checkout/sessions \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d \"line_items[0][price]\"={{PRICE_ID}} \\\n -d \"line_items[0][quantity]\"=1 \\\n -d mode=subscription \\\n --data-urlencode success_url=\"https://example.com/success\" \\\n --data-urlencode cancel_url=\"https://example.com/cancel\" \\\n -d \"consent_collection[payment_method_reuse_agreement][position]\"=hidden \\\n--data-urlencode \"custom_text[after_submit][message]\"=\"You can cancel your\nsubscription at any time by [logging into your\naccount](https://www.example.com/)\"\n```\n\n## Links\n\n- [https://www.stripe.com/).](https://www.stripe.com/))\n- [https://example.com/success](https://example.com/success)\n- [https://example.com/cancel](https://example.com/cancel)\n- [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)\n- [Checkout Settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/checkout)\n- [Public Detail Settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public)\n- [https://example.com/terms)](https://example.com/terms))\n-\n[consent.terms_of_service](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object#checkout_session_object-consent)\n- [collect their\nconsent](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/promotional-emails-consent)\n- [https://www.example.com/)](https://www.example.com/))",
