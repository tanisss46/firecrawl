You can customize\nall the Elements to match the look and branding of your application.\n\n![Examples of apps using the Address Element, Mobile Payment Element, and Card\nElement in an iOS\napp.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/ios-landing.35eb3fe43605b2b982353f4bdac95840.png)\n\n## Mobile Payment Element\n\nAccept payments using the Mobile Payment Element. Choose between two Payment\nUIs: the Payment Sheet or the Embedded Element.\n\n[Payment SheetAccept payments by opening a prebuilt sheet anywhere in your\napp.](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/mobile/accept-payment)[Embedded\nElementAccept payments by embedding a customizable drop-in component with a list\nof payment methods on any screen in your\napp.Private-preview](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/mobile/embedded)\n### Features\n\n- [Access to over 100 global payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/overview) This\nincludes Apple Pay, Link, and other popular payment methods that are\nautomatically enabled.\n- [Dynamic payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/dynamic-payment-methods)\nSimplify your payment methods code by dynamically ordering and displaying\npayment methods and [launch A/B\ntests](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/a-b-testing) for new payment methods.\n- [UI customizations to match your\napp](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/appearance-api/mobile) Change the UI to\nfit your app’s design. The layout stays consistent, but you can modify colors,\nfonts, and more.\n- [Address\ncollection](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/mobile/save-during-payment#collect-payment-details)\nCollect complete or partial billing addresses with any payment method.\n- [Save and display cards and bank\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/mobile/accept-payment#enable-saved-cards)\nSave, reuse, and manage cards and bank accounts. You can also [store a\ncustomer’s payment details without an initial\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/mobile/set-up-future-payments).\n\n## Other in-app Elements\n\nUse the Element that best suits your use case. For example, use the Address\nElement to collect shipping addresses or to collect billing addresses separately\nfrom payment details.\n\nAdditionally, you can use the Customer Sheet to let your users manage their\npayment methods on your app’s settings page. However, because the Customer Sheet\nalone doesn’t support checkout flows, you must also use the Mobile Payment\nElement to process payments.\n\n[Address ElementA prebuilt sheet for collecting billing and shipping\naddresses.](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/mobile/address-element)[Customer\nSheetA prebuilt UI for managing a customer’s saved payment methods in your app’s\nsettings page.](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/customer-sheet)[Card ElementUse\nthe basic card field in your own payment\nUI.Legacy](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/card-element)\n## Sign up for updates\n\n## Sign up to be notified of new features and betas.\n\nProvide your email to receive early access to eligible beta features for Stripe\nElements.\n\nCollect EmailSign upRead our [privacy policy](https://stripe.com/privacy).\n\n## Links\n\n- [iOS](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios)\n- [Android](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-android)\n- [React Native](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native)\n- [Payment SheetAccept payments by opening a prebuilt sheet anywhere in your\napp.](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/mobile/accept-payment)\n- [Embedded ElementAccept payments by embedding a customizable drop-in component\nwith a list of payment methods on any screen in your\napp.Private-preview](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/mobile/embedded)\n- [Access to over 100 global payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/overview)\n- [Dynamic payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/dynamic-payment-methods)\n- [launch A/B tests](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/a-b-testing)\n- [UI customizations to match your\napp](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/appearance-api/mobile)\n- [Address\ncollection](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/mobile/save-during-payment#collect-payment-details)\n- [Save and display cards and bank\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/mobile/accept-payment#enable-saved-cards)\n- [store a customer’s payment details without an initial\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/mobile/set-up-future-payments)\n- [Address ElementA prebuilt sheet for collecting billing and shipping\naddresses.](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/mobile/address-element)\n- [Customer SheetA prebuilt UI for managing a customer’s saved payment methods\nin your app’s settings page.](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/customer-sheet)\n- [Card ElementUse the basic card field in your own payment\nUI.Legacy](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/card-element)\n- [privacy policy](https://stripe.com/privacy)",
