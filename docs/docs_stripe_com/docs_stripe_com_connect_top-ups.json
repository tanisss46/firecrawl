  "content": "# Add funds to your platform balance\n\n## Platforms can add funds to their balance from a bank account.\n\nAvailable in: \nPlatforms can add funds to their Stripe balance to pay connected accounts for\ngoods or services. There are a number of different use cases for adding funds to\npay connected accounts for goods or services, including:\n\n- Paying bonuses or other one-off [payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts),\nindependent of specific charges.\n- Providing customer discounts while still paying full price for goods or\nservices to sellers.\n- Adding funds from non-Stripe income (for example, checks or funds from another\nprocessor).\n- Enabling faster payouts (for example, pay a vendor before incoming funds\nbecome available).\n\nWhere permitted, platforms can also add funds to their Stripe balance to send\nfunds to recipients off of Stripe (for example, via [cross-border\npayouts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/cross-border-payouts)). They can also\npay out added funds to other accounts they own.\n\n#### Note\n\nIf a transfer or payout fails due to insufficient funds in your platform\nbalance, adding funds doesn’t automatically retry the failed action. After\nadding funds, you must repeat any failed transfers or payouts.\n\n## Requirements\n\nAll of these requirements must be met to add funds to your Stripe balance:\n\n- Your platform is in the US and the connected account receiving the funds\neither is in the US or has a\n[recipient](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/service-agreement-types#recipient)\nservice agreement.\n- Your platform profile is approved. You can check the status in your\n[settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/settings/profile) after\ncompleting the platform profile.\n\nWhen adding funds to your balance, use a manual payout schedule. If you enable\nautomatic payouts, you can’t control whether the system uses added funds for\npayouts. You can configure your schedule in your [payout\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payouts).\n\n#### Note\n\nOnly [team members](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/teams) with\nadministrator access to the platform Stripe account and who’ve enabled [two\nfactor\nauthentication](https://support.stripe.com/questions/how-do-i-enable-two-step-verification)\ncan add funds.\n\nIf you’re new to [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect), start with a guide\nto add funds to your platform balance and [pay out\nmoney](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/add-and-pay-out-guide).\n\n[Confirm funding\npurpose](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/top-ups#confirm-funding-purpose)\nTo add funds, go to the\n[Balance](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/balance/overview) section in the\nDashboard.\n\n!\n\nClick **Add to balance** and select why you are adding funds to your account.\n\n!\n\nClick **Pay out connected accounts** to add funds that are paid out to your\nconnected accounts. If you are adding funds to your balance to cover future\nrefunds and disputes, or to repay your platform’s negative balance, click\n**Cover negative balances** and see [adding funds to your Stripe\nbalance](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/add-funds).\n\n[Verify your bank\naccount](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/top-ups#verify-bank-account)\nYou must use a verified bank account to add funds. You’ll go through the\nverification process in the Dashboard when you first attempt to add funds from\nan unverified bank account.\n\nIf your bank account is unverified, you’ll need to confirm two microdeposits\nfrom Stripe. These deposits appear on your online banking statement within 1-2\nbusiness days. You’ll see `ACCTVERIFY` for the statement description.\n\nStripe notifies you in the Dashboard and through email when the microdeposits\nshould have arrived in your account. To complete the verification process, click\nthe Dashboard notification in the\n[Balance](https://dashboard.stripe.com/balance/overview) section, enter the two\nmicrodeposit amounts, and click **Verify account**.\n\n[Add funds](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/top-ups#add-funds)\nOnce verified, you can use the\n[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/balance/overview) or the\n[API](https://docs.stripe.com/api#topups) to add funds to your account balance.\n\nDashboardAPI- In the Dashboard, go to the\n[Balance](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/balance/overview) section.\n- In the **Add to balance** window, enter an amount in USD and click **Connect\npayouts**.\n- In the resulting modal window (shown below), enter an amount in USD.\n- Verify the amount and click **Add funds.**\n- The resulting object is called a\n[top-up](https://docs.stripe.com/api/topups/object) and can be viewed in the\n[Top-ups](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/topups) section of the Dashboard.\n- After the funds are available in your platform’s Stripe balance, you can\ntransfer funds to a connected account through the\n[API](https://docs.stripe.com/api#transfers) or the\n[Dashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard/managing-individual-accounts#sending-funds).\nIn the Dashboard, transfer funds to a connected account by clicking **Add\nfunds** in the **Balance** section of the connected account’s detail page.\n\n## View your funds\n\nView your added funds in the Dashboard on\n[Top-ups](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/topups) tab under the\n[Balance](https://dashboard.stripe.com/balance/overview) page. Each time you add\nfunds, a top-up object is made that has a unique ID with the format `tu_XXXXXX`,\nwhich you can see on the detailed view for the top-up.\n\n## Settlement timing\n\nUS platforms add funds via ACH debit, and can take 5-6 business days to become\navailable in your Stripe balance. You can request a review of your account for\nfaster settlement timing by contacting [Stripe\nSupport](https://support.stripe.com/contact).\n\nAs we learn more about your account, Stripe might be able to decrease your\nsettlement timing automatically.\n\nAdding funds for future refunds and disputes or to repay a negative balance can\nhappen through [bank or wire\ntransfer](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/add-funds), and be\navailable in 1-2 business days.\n\n## Testing\n\nYou can use the Dashboard or the API to [test adding funds to your\nbalance](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/testing#testing-top-ups).\n\n## Links\n\n- [payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts)\n- [cross-border payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/cross-border-payouts)\n- [recipient](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/service-agreement-types#recipient)\n- [settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/settings/profile)\n- [payout settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payouts)\n- [team members](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/teams)\n- [two factor\nauthentication](https://support.stripe.com/questions/how-do-i-enable-two-step-verification)\n- [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)\n- [pay out money](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/add-and-pay-out-guide)\n- [Balance](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/balance/overview)\n- [adding funds to your Stripe\nbalance](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/add-funds)\n- [Balance](https://dashboard.stripe.com/balance/overview)\n- [API](https://docs.stripe.com/api#topups)\n- [top-up](https://docs.stripe.com/api/topups/object)\n- [Top-ups](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/topups)\n- [API](https://docs.stripe.com/api#transfers)\n-\n[Dashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard/managing-individual-accounts#sending-funds)\n- [Stripe Support](https://support.stripe.com/contact)\n- [test adding funds to your\nbalance](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/testing#testing-top-ups)",
