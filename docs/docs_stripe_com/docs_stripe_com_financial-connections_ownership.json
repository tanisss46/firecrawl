Check your [Dashboard\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/financial-connections) to check\nthe state of your registration or begin the registration process. Test mode\nFinancial Connections data is always available.\n\n[Create a\ncustomerRecommendedServer-side](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/ownership#customer)\nWe recommend that you create a [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers)\nwith an email address to represent your user, that you then attach to your\npayment. Attaching a Customer object allows you to [list previously linked\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/accounts/list)\nlater. By providing an email address on the Customer object, Financial\nConnections can improve the authentication flow by streamlining sign-in or\nsign-up for your user, depending on whether they’re a returning\n[Link](https://support.stripe.com/questions/link-for-financial-connections-support-for-businesses)\nuser.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d email={{CUSTOMER_EMAIL}}\n```\n\n[Request access to an account's ownership\ndataServer-side](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/ownership#request-account-ownership)\nYou must collect an account before you can access its ownership data. To learn\nmore about how to collect Financial Connections Accounts, read the integration\nguide most relevant to your use case (for example, [accept\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/ach-direct-debit-payments),\n[facilitate Connect\npayouts](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/connect-payouts), or\n[build other-data powered\nproducts](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/other-data-powered-products)).\n\nIf you use [Connect Onboarding for Custom\nAccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/payouts-bank-accounts?bank-account-collection-integration=prebuilt-web-form)\nto collect Financial Connections Accounts, configure which data you want access\nto in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/custom).\n\nIf you use an API integration to collect accounts, specify the data you need\naccess to with the\n[permissions](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/fundamentals#data-permissions)\nparameter. The set of requested data permissions are viewable by the user in the\n[authentication\nflow](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/fundamentals#authentication-flow).\nFinancial Connections Accounts are collectible through various integration\npaths, and how you specify the parameter varies slightly by API.\n\nSetup IntentsPayment IntentsSessionsCheckoutInvoicesSubscriptions\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/setup_intents \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d customer={{CUSTOMER_ID}} \\\n -d \"payment_method_types[]\"=us_bank_account \\\n-d\n\"payment_method_options[us_bank_account][financial_connections][permissions][]\"=ownership\n\\\n-d\n\"payment_method_options[us_bank_account][financial_connections][permissions][]\"=payment_method\n```\n\nWhen using dynamic payment methods for certain payments APIs, you can also\nconfigure requested permissions in the Dashboard. Learn how to [access\nadditional account data on Financial Connections\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/ach-direct-debit-payments?dashboard-or-api=dashboard#access).\n\n[Initiate an ownership\nrefreshServer-side](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/ownership#initiate-ownership-refresh)\nAll Financial Connections data retrievals are asynchronous. You initiate an\nownership refresh and wait for it to complete, then retrieve the results. You\ncan initiate ownership refreshes with the `prefetch` API parameter or the\n[Refresh\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/accounts/refresh).\n\n### Prefetch ownership data\n\nSpecify whether you want to prefetch account ownership details *before* account\ncollection. This initiates the refresh process as soon as your user connects\ntheir account in the [authentication\nflow](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/fundamentals#authentication-flow).\nSet `prefetch` when you require ownership data for every linked account, to make\nsure you receive it with minimal delay. The `prefetch` parameter is available on\nall APIs that support Financial Connections.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/setup_intents \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d customer={{CUSTOMER_ID}} \\\n -d \"payment_method_types[]\"=us_bank_account \\\n-d\n\"payment_method_options[us_bank_account][financial_connections][prefetch][]\"=ownership\n\\\n-d\n\"payment_method_options[us_bank_account][financial_connections][permissions][]\"=payment_method\n\\\n-d\n\"payment_method_options[us_bank_account][financial_connections][permissions][]\"=ownership\n```\n\n### Initiate an on-demand refresh\n\nUse the [Refresh\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/accounts/refresh) to\ninitiate on-demand ownership refreshes *after* account collection, and fetch\nownership information for a specific account at your convenience, allowing you\nto defer the decision until a later time. Although account ownership data can\nchange, it generally doesn’t change as frequently as\n[balance](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/balances) or\n[transaction](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/transactions) data.\n\nUse the Financial Connections account ID to initiate a refresh. If you’re\nintegrating through a payments flow, find the account ID [on the associated\nPayment\nMethod](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/ach-direct-debit-payments#finding-the-financial-connections-account-id).\nWhen using a Financial Connections Session, retrieve it [through the\nsession](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/other-data-powered-products?platform=web#collect-an-account).\n\n```\ncurl\nhttps://api.stripe.com/v1/financial_connections/accounts/{{ACCOUNT_ID}}/refresh\n\\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d \"features[]\"=ownership\n```\n\n#### Note\n\nRefreshes aren’t allowed on inactive accounts.\n\n### Wait for the ownership refresh to complete\n\nThe\n[ownership_refresh](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/accounts/object#financial_connections_account_object-ownership_refresh)\nfield on a Financial Connections account represents the ownership refresh state.\nThis field remains `null` until you request the `ownership` permission and\ninitiate a refresh. After you start an ownership refresh, the state changes to\n`pending`, and after completion, it moves to either `succeeded` or `failed`. We\nsend the\n[financial_connections.account.refreshed_ownership](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-financial_connections.account.refreshed_ownership)\nevent when the ownership refresh completes. To determine the success of the\nownership refresh, check the `ownership_refresh.status` field while handling the\nwebhook.\n\nownership_refresh: `null`\n\nownership_refresh.status: `pending`\n\nownership_refresh.status: `succeeded`\n\nownership_refresh.status: `failed`\n\nfinancial_connections.account.refreshed_ownership\n\nprefetchRefresh APIsuccessfailureOwnership refresh flow\nAfter an ownership refresh completes, Stripe sets the availability of future\nrefreshes through the\n[ownership_refresh.next_refresh_available_at](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/accounts/object#financial_connections_account_object-ownership_refresh-next_refresh_available_at)\nfield. Check this field before initiating a new ownership refresh to make sure\nthat refreshes are currently available. If you attempt a refresh while the value\nis `null` (as is always the case when the refresh is pending or the account is\ninactive) or the current time is less than the `next_refresh_available_at`\ntimestamp, the refresh won’t be initiated.\n\n#### Private preview\n\nIn the unlikely event that a refresh fails, the `error` field on the refresh\nhash is a preview feature that provides the cause of the failure and recommended\nnext steps. If you’d like to use it, [email\nus](mailto:financial-connections-beta+refresh-error@stripe.com) for access.\n\n[Retrieve an account's ownership\ndataServer-side](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/ownership#retrieve-account-ownership)\nAfter the ownership refresh completes, retrieve the Financial Connections\naccount from the API and expand the\n[ownership](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/accounts/object#financial_connections_account_object-ownership)\nfield to see ownership details.\n\n```\ncurl -G https://api.stripe.com/v1/financial_connections/accounts/{{ACCOUNT_ID}}\n\\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d \"expand[]\"=ownership\n```\n\nThis returns the Financial Connections account with the ownership field expanded\nto list the account’s owners:\n\n```\n{\n \"id\": \"fca_zbyrdjTrwcYZJZc6WBs6GPid\",\n \"object\": \"financial_connections.account\",\n \"ownership\": {\n \"id\": \"fcaowns_1MzTG4IG1CZuezXppfPbUpXb\",\n \"object\": \"financial_connections.account_ownership\",\n \"created\": 1651784999,\n \"owners\": {\n \"object\": \"list\",\n \"data\": [\n {\n \"name\": \"Jenny Rosen\",\n \"email\": \"jenny.rosen@example.com\",\n \"phone\": \"+1 555-555-5555\",\n \"ownership\": \"fcaowns_1MzTG4IG1CZuezXppfPbUpXb\",\n \"raw_address\": \"510 Townsend San Francisco, CA 94103\",\n \"refreshed_at\": 1651784999\n }\n ],\n \"has_more\": false,\n\"url\":\n\"/v1/financial_connections/accounts/fca_zbyrdjTrwcYZJZc6WBs6GPid/owners?ownership=fcaowns_1MzTG4IG1CZuezXppfPbUpXb\"\n }\n },\n \"ownership_refresh\": {\n \"status\": \"succeeded\",\n \"last_attempted_at\": 1651784999,\n \"next_refresh_available_at\": 1651785000\n },\n // ...\n}\n```\n\nStripe returns the ownership information made available by a financial\ninstitution, and the availability of ownership details varies. We return all\navailable fields and owners provided by the bank. Ownership details can include\naccount owner name, address, email, and phone number.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Financial Connections\naccount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/accounts/object)\n- [Dashboard\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/financial-connections)\n- [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers)\n- [list previously linked\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/accounts/list)\n-\n[Link](https://support.stripe.com/questions/link-for-financial-connections-support-for-businesses)\n- [accept\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/ach-direct-debit-payments)\n- [facilitate Connect\npayouts](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/connect-payouts)\n- [build other-data powered\nproducts](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/other-data-powered-products)\n- [Connect Onboarding for Custom\nAccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/payouts-bank-accounts?bank-account-collection-integration=prebuilt-web-form)\n- [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/custom)\n-\n[permissions](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/fundamentals#data-permissions)\n- [authentication\nflow](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/fundamentals#authentication-flow)\n- [access additional account data on Financial Connections\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/ach-direct-debit-payments?dashboard-or-api=dashboard#access)\n- [Refresh\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/accounts/refresh)\n- [balance](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/balances)\n- [transaction](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/transactions)\n- [on the associated Payment\nMethod](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/ach-direct-debit-payments#finding-the-financial-connections-account-id)\n- [through the\nsession](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/other-data-powered-products?platform=web#collect-an-account)\n-\n[ownership_refresh](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/accounts/object#financial_connections_account_object-ownership_refresh)\n-\n[financial_connections.account.refreshed_ownership](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-financial_connections.account.refreshed_ownership)\n-\n[ownership_refresh.next_refresh_available_at](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/accounts/object#financial_connections_account_object-ownership_refresh-next_refresh_available_at)\n-\n[ownership](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/accounts/object#financial_connections_account_object-ownership)",
