You can view your program setup from the [Issuing Dashboard
settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/issuing/card-programs).

## BIN Setup

A Bank Identification Number (BIN) is a 6 or 8-digit identifier at the beginning
of a card number. The BIN represents both the card network and the bank that
issues the card. A BIN is licensed for you when you create your program. Most
users have one BIN per Issuing setup.

Account ranges are the digits that immediately follow the BIN on a card number.
For 6-digit BINs, these are the seventh to ninth digits on a card. For 8-digit
BINs, the account range is the ninth digit on a card. BINs work together with
account ranges to help acquirers identify the card issuer. Set up your Issuing
program on either a shared BIN or a dedicated BIN:

- **Shared BIN**: Your BIN is shared with other card network users. This is the
default and recommended option for most users because it’s the simplest and
least costly to enable. A user on a shared BIN might have a unique account range
to help acquirers identify authorizations coming from that user.
- **Dedicated BIN** Beta: The entire BIN is only associated with your accounts.

## Card product type

*Card product type* is a setting that affects the features available to you and
your cardholders through Stripe Issuing. We recommend selecting a card product
type based on the size of your business and what you purchase with the cards.

#### Note

*Card product type* differs from *card type*. *Card type* usually indicates a
different aspect of the card, such as whether it’s a credit or debit card.

Stripe offers four primary card product types:

TypeDescriptionBest forVisa BusinessHelps small businesses and organizations
separate business and personal expenses. This allows your business to better
manage cash flow. This includes business tooling like receipt capture and
accounting software integrations.Small businesses with <100 employees—or
platforms who serve them—who want to manage their business expenses.Visa
Business SignatureSame as Visa Business, with extra perks and benefits.Designed
for Small businesses to optimize their cash flow and earn rewards for their
business. Ideal for businesses that seek rewards and protection
benefits.Commercial Corporate cardHelps employees pay their travel and
entertainment (T&E) expenses securely. Your company has access to granular
information to effectively manage spending.Mid-size businesses to large
enterprises (100+ employees)—or platforms who serve them—who primarily need to
manage spend on travel and entertainment expenses.Commercial Fleet cardProvides
payment solutions to manage all expenses generated by a vehicle fleet operation,
including fuel, maintenance and repairs.Mid-size to large enterprises (100+
employees)—or platforms who serve them—who manage fleet expenses.Commercial
Purchasing cardExpedites the procurement process and saves cost by eliminating
the need to issue purchase orders for procurement, invoices, and checks.Mid-size
to large enterprises (100+ employees)—or platforms who serve them—with use cases
that don’t fit into Commercial Corporate or Commercial Fleet.
The card product type you choose affects the type of data you receive for each
transaction.

For example:

A user with a *Commercial Fleet card* receives specific fleet-related data for
transactions, such as:

- Number of gallons pumped
- Type of fuel pumped
- Odometer readings
- Itemized fuel and non-fuel purchases

A user with a *Commercial Corporate card* receives specific travel and
entertainment-related data for transactions, such as:

- Flight carrier
- Flight departure time
- Airport code
- Hotel check-in date
- Number of nights in a hotel stay

A user with a *Commercial Purchasing card* receives invoice-specific data for
transactions, such as:

- Number of items purchased
- Quantity of each item

Set up multiple card product types on Stripe if more than one card product type
is relevant for your business. You can’t use multiple card product types if you
set up a Business card.

## Network preference

Stripe supports both the Mastercard and Visa card networks. When you onboard to
Issuing, you decide which card network to issue cards with, and it’s considered
your default network. To change your default network at any time, see [Stripe
Support](https://support.stripe.com/topics/issuing) for more details.

### Multi-network issuing Beta

We now offer the option to issue cards on both Mastercard and Visa. With this
functionality, you can issue cards on both networks simultaneously.

Issuing cards on both Mastercard and Visa is limited to preview users. You must
be an Issuing customer to join the preview. To request access to the preview,
visit [Stripe support](https://support.stripe.com/) and contact the support
team.

## Funding types

When setting up your Issuing program, you need to choose how you want to fund
the cards. Choose your funding type based on your card product type and what
best suits your liquidity options. Stripe offers two options that support a
variety of business needs:

Funding optionDetailsBest forPrepaidCard balances are pre-funded into an account
that’s reloaded by the platform (in case of a direct integration), or by a
connected account, as often as necessary.Pre-loading balances without an
attached checking account.CreditCard balances are linked to an external credit
account.Pre-loading balances with an attached external credit account.
Funding options vary depending on the [card product

you select.

## Card benefits and rewards

### Card benefits

All cards issued through Stripe have a roster of available cardholder benefits.
By default, your cardholders receive automatically-included benefits that vary
depending on the card product type of your program. You can also enroll your
program in optional benefits that fit the needs of your use case and can help
drive cardholder transactions in the categories you aim to incentivize spend
for. [Optional
benefits](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/customize-your-program#optional-benefits)
are available for a fee.

By default, cardholders get the following benefits with each card product:

### Optional benefits

select the benefits you’re interested in or want your cards enrolled in, your
Stripe account or support partner will work with you to provide additional

### Marketing

Communicating benefit details to cardholders is critical to ensuring they find
value in benefits and use them. Our card network provider must review and
approve all marketing materials or cardholder-facing terms before publishing. We
work with you during the approval process by supplying you with sample,
pre-approved messaging if you don’t draft your own. This is a required step to
launching a benefits program. The review process can take 5-7 business days.

### Rewards

Although Stripe doesn’t provide rewards on any of its issued cards, you can set
up your own rewards program on any of the cards you issue through us. Of the
card product types Stripe offers, rewards are only a requirement for Visa
Business Signature. The only requirement before going live is to make sure that
our card network partner has reviewed and signed off on the reward terms and
promotion details.
