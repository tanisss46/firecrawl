# Collect tax in Kenya

## Learn how to use Stripe Tax to calculate, collect, and report tax in Kenya.

In Kenya, Stripe only supports collecting VAT for electronic, internet and
digital marketplace supplies. In Stripe, these are referred to as “digital
products.” To collect this tax on Stripe, you must be a remote seller without a
physical presence in the country.

## When to register for tax collection

See [Thresholds](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/thresholds) to get insights
about your potential tax registration obligations in Kenya. Stripe also notifies
you with email and Dashboard alerts when you need to register to collect tax.
Learn more about how the [monitoring tool
works](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/monitoring).

Remote sellers providing digital goods or electronically supplied services
(digital products) to both businesses and individuals in Kenya must register for
VAT within 30 days after the first sale.

- **Threshold**: 1 transaction
- **Included transactions**: Business-to-consumer (B2C) and business-to-business
(B2B) sales of digital goods or electronically supplied services (digital
products)

## Register to collect tax

You must be a remote seller with no physical presence in Kenya to collect this

Learn more about [how to add your
registration](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/registering#track-your-registrations-in-the-tax-dashboard)
in the Dashboard.

## How we calculate taxes

We only support calculations for [digital
products](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes?type=digital) (non-physical
items or services that are delivered, given, or rendered electronically) in
Kenya. Stripe doesn’t calculate tax for products that don’t use a digital
product tax code.

View the list of supported [digital product tax
codes](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes?type=digital). To calculate taxes
in Kenya, make sure that you [assign a tax
code](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/products-prices-tax-codes-tax-behavior#tax-code-on-product)
to each of your products.

## Report and file your taxes

Stripe provides reports of your completed tax transactions. Go to
[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations) to access these
reports. Learn more about [the different types of
reports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports).

You’re responsible for filing and remitting your taxes to Kenya. Stripe doesn’t
file taxes on your behalf.
