Sales to business customers in Montenegro don’t trigger any tax\nregistration obligations because non-resident businesses aren’t required to\ncollect tax on these sales.\n\n- **Threshold**: 1 transaction\n- **Included transactions**: Business-to-consumer (B2C) sales of digital goods\nor electronically supplied services (digital products)\n\n## Register to collect tax\n\nYou must be a remote seller with no physical presence in Montenegro to collect\nthis tax on Stripe.
