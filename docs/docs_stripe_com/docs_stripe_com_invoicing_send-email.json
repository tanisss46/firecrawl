Certain email notifications contain a link to a Stripe-hosted page\nthat customers can use to confirm or update their payment details.\n\nIn your [Email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/emails), you can\nopt out of sending your customers emails for successful payments. If you’re\n[automatically charging](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/automatic-charging) a\ncustomer and you’ve turned off emails for successful payments, they won’t\nreceive an [email\nreceipt](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/dashboard#invoice-receipts). To learn\nhow to send automatic email receipts, see [Email receipts and paid\ninvoices](https://docs.stripe.com/receipts#automatically-send-receipts).\n\nTo turn on automatic reminders, navigate to your [Invoicing\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/billing/invoice) and scroll\ndown to **Manage advanced invoicing features** > **Send reminders if a one-off\ninvoice hasn’t been paid**.

Click on the customer’s\ninvoice, followed by **Send invoice**.

The email links to a Stripe-hosted page where they can confirm the\npayment.\n\n## Additional email recipients\n\nYou can provide additional recipients to your customer’s Billing emails\n(including receipts sent after successful payments) using the Dashboard.\n\n#### Note\n\nThe Stripe API doesn’t currently support adding recipients to Billing emails.\n\n- Go to the [Customers page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/customers) in\nyour Dashboard.\n- Click the customer you want to add email recipients for to open the customer’s\ndetail page.\n- Click the **Edit** link in the **Details** section of the left pane to open\nthe **Update customer** dialog.\n\n![Details section with Edit link\nhighlighted.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/edit-emails.18a5f678dc05901c6d1e5ade713afdc1.png)\n- In the **Billing information** section of the **Update customer** dialog,\nunselect the **Same as account email** checkbox.\n\n![Billing section with same as account checkbox\nunselected.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/additional-emails.df018f8ddec164bb58653a0ede84d1a8.png)\n- *(Optional)* Set the value of the displayed field to a comma-separated list of\nemails that should be in the “To” line of Billing emails. If you leave this\nfield blank, Stripe continues to use the account email.\n- Click the **Add more recipients** link to access the **Emails to CC** field.\nSet the value of the field to a comma-separated list of email addresses that you\nwant in the CC line of Billing (Invoice and Subscription) emails.\n\nIf you add recipients to the Customer using the previous steps, Stripe\nautomatically pre-populates these emails to invoices you send through the\nDashboard.\n\n## Change the Stripe invoice template\n\nYou can create your own custom email template to replace the Stripe prebuilt\nemail by [configuring the invoice\ntemplate](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/invoice). Stripe applies\nyour custom template to all new invoices.\n\n## Disable Stripe invoice emails and send your own\n\nStripe can use [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) to notify you of\nchanges to your invoices—when they’re finalized, paid, marked uncollectible, and\nso on. For each event that you receive, you can construct and deliver your own\nemails. If you disable finalized invoice emails, Stripe continues to send\nwebhooks as a reminder for your own email solution. Learn more about [webhook\nendpoints and\ninvoices](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/webhooks#understand).\n\n## Email PDF attachments\n\nWhen Stripe emails an invoice, we automatically include a PDF attachment of the\nsame invoice to assist your customer with record keeping. If you turn on emails\nfor successful payments—and an invoice is set to charge automatically—the\nreceipt email includes a PDF attachment of both the original invoice and the\ninvoice receipt. Visit the [Invoice\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/invoice) to disable this\nbehavior.\n\n## Email logs\n\nFor the customer emails sent within the last 30 days, their logs are available\nto view within the [customer](https://dashboard.stripe.com/customers) page.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Use the Dashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/dashboard)\n- [Customize invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/customize)\n- [Hosted Invoice Page](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/hosted-invoice-page)\n- [Automate customer\nemails](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/revenue-recovery/customer-emails)\n\n## Links\n\n- [invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n- [customizable](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/customize)\n- [Email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/emails)\n- [automatically charging](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/automatic-charging)\n- [email receipt](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/dashboard#invoice-receipts)\n- [Email receipts and paid\ninvoices](https://docs.stripe.com/receipts#automatically-send-receipts)\n- [Invoicing\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/billing/invoice)\n- [custom email\ndomain](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/email-domain)\n-\n[finalizes](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/workflow-transitions#finalized)\n- [3D Secure](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure)\n- [branding](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/branding)\n- [Prevent failed\npayments](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/automatic)\n- [Invoices page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/invoices)\n- [Hosted Invoice Page](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/hosted-invoice-page)\n- [Advanced invoicing\nfeatures](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/invoice)\n- [recover\nrevenue](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/revenue-recovery/customer-emails)\n- [Customers page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/customers)\n- [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks)\n- [webhook endpoints and\ninvoices](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/webhooks#understand)\n- [customer](https://dashboard.stripe.com/customers)\n- [Use the Dashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/dashboard)",
