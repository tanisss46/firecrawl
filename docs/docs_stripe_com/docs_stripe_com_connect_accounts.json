  "content": "# Connect account types\n\n## Learn about older connected account configurations.\n\nWhen using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect), you create a [connected\naccount](https://docs.stripe.com/connect) for each business or individual that\nsigns up to access your platform’s services. You can configure your platform and\nconnected accounts to fit your business model, distributing specific\nresponsibilities between your platform, Stripe, and your connected accounts.\n\nIf you’re setting up a new Connect platform, see [Design an\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/design-an-integration) to learn\nabout configuring connected accounts. The information on this page applies only\nto less flexible connected account types, which are mainly used by existing\nplatforms.\n\n#### Note\n\nIf your existing connected accounts are configured as a type, you can still\n[migrate your platform to support new connected accounts that are configured\nwithout\ntypes](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/migrate-to-controller-properties). During\nand after migration, your platform can continue to support your existing\nconnected accounts without interruption.\n\nConnect supports the following account types:\n\n- [Standard](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/standard-accounts)\n- [Express](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/express-accounts)\n- [Custom](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom-accounts)\n\n## Choose an account type\n\nYou must consider several factors when choosing an account type. Integration\neffort and connected account user experience are especially important because\nthey can affect engineering resource expenditure and conversion rates. After you\ncreate a connected account, you can’t change its type.\n\nStripe recommends that you [use controller\nproperties](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/migrate-to-controller-properties)\ninstead of account types. If you want to use account types, we recommend Express\nor Standard connected accounts because they require less integration effort. For\nmore control over your connected accounts, consider using Custom connected\naccounts. To learn which account type we recommend for your business, refer to\nyour [platform profile](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/settings/profile).\n\nThere’s an additional cost for using Express or Custom connected accounts.\n\nStandard Express Custom Integration effortLowestLowSignificantly\nhigherIntegration methodAPI or OAuthAPIAPIFraud and dispute liabilityConnected\naccountPlatformPlatformPlatform can specify payout timing?Yes, with [Platform\ncontrols](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/platform-controls-for-stripe-dashboard-accounts)YesYesOnboardingStripeStripePlatform\nor StripeIdentity information gatheringStripeStripePlatform or StripeConnected\naccount can access the Dashboard?Yes, full DashboardYes, Express\nDashboardNoConnected account support provided byPlatform and StripePlatform and\nStripePlatformAutomatic updates for new compliance requirementsYesSupport\nnew countries without integration changesYesIdeal for platformsWith\nexperienced online businesses as connected accountsAny typeWith significant\nengineering resources to dedicate to a fully white-labeled experience\nWith Standard connected accounts, the connected account is responsible for fraud\nand disputes when using [direct\ncharges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges#types), but that can vary when\nusing [destination charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges#types).\n\n## Express connected accounts\n\nWith *Express* connected accounts, Stripe handles the onboarding and identity\nverification processes. The platform has the ability to specify [charge\ntypes](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges) and set the connected account’s\n[payout settings](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/payouts-connected-accounts)\nprogrammatically. The platform is responsible for handling disputes and refunds,\nwhich is similar to a Custom connected account.\n\nAlthough your connected account has interactions with Stripe, they primarily\ninteract with your platform, particularly for the core payment processing\nfunctionality. For Express connected account holders, Stripe provides an Express\nDashboard (a lighter version of the Dashboard) that allows them to manage their\npersonal information and see [payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts) to their\nbank.\n\nUse Express connected accounts when you:\n\n- Want to get started quickly (letting Stripe handle account onboarding,\nmanagement, and identity verification)\n- Want to use [destination\ncharges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges) or [separate\ncharges and\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n- Want significant control over interactions with your connected accounts\n\nExamples of platforms that use Express connected accounts include, but are not\nlimited to: a [home-rental\nmarketplace](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/collect-then-transfer-guide) like\nAirbnb, or a ride-hailing service like Lyft.\n\nGlobal compliance requirements do evolve and change over time. With Express,\nStripe proactively collects information when requirements change. For best\npractices on how to communicate to your connected accounts when that happens,\nvisit the [guide for Express\naccounts](https://support.stripe.com/questions/best-practices-for-connect-platforms-communicating-updates-to-verification-requirements-with-standard-or-express-connected-accounts).\n\n### Express connected account availability\n\nSelect one of the available countries when you create an Express connected\naccount. You can’t change the country later.\n\nSome countries are available only when using [cross-border\npayouts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/cross-border-payouts).\n\nTo know when Express connected accounts are available in your country, [contact\nStripe](mailto:connect@stripe.com).\n\nAlbaniaAntigua &\nBarbudaArgentinaArmeniaAustraliaAustriaBahamasBahrainBelgiumBeninBoliviaBosnia &\nHerzegovinaBotswanaBruneiBulgariaCambodiaCanadaChileColombiaCosta RicaCôte\nd’IvoireCyprusCzech RepublicDenmarkDominican RepublicEcuadorEgyptEl\nSalvadorEstoniaEthiopiaFinlandFranceGambiaGermanyGhanaGreeceGuatemalaGuyanaHong\nKongHungaryIcelandIrelandIsraelItalyJamaicaJapanJordanKenyaKuwaitLatviaLithuaniaLuxembourgMacao\nSAR\nChinaMadagascarMaltaMauritiusMexicoMoldovaMonacoMongoliaMoroccoNamibiaNetherlandsNew\nZealandNigeriaNorth\nMacedoniaNorwayOmanPakistanPanamaParaguayPeruPhilippinesPolandPortugalQatarRomaniaRwandaSaudi\nArabiaSenegalSerbiaSingaporeSlovakiaSloveniaSouth AfricaSouth KoreaSpainSri\nLankaSt. LuciaSwedenSwitzerlandTaiwanTanzaniaThailandTrinidad &\nTobagoTunisiaTurkeyUnited Arab EmiratesUnited KingdomUnited\nStatesUruguayUzbekistanVietnam\n## Standard connected accounts\n\nA *Standard* connected account is a conventional Stripe account where the\nconnected account has a direct relationship with Stripe, is able to log in to\nthe [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/), and can process charges on their\nown.\n\nUse Standard connected accounts when you:\n\n- Want to get started quickly and don’t need a lot of control over interactions\nwith your connected accounts\n- Want to use [direct charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges)\n- Have connected accounts that are familiar with running online businesses or\nthat already have a Stripe account\n- Prefer that Stripe handles direct communication with the connected account for\naccount issues (for example, to request more information for identity\nverification purposes)\n\nSome examples of platforms that use Standard connected accounts are [store\nbuilders](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/enable-payment-acceptance-guide) like\nShopify, and Software as a Service (SaaS) platforms such as an online invoicing\nand payment service.\n\nGlobal compliance requirements do evolve and change over time. With Standard\nconnected accounts, Stripe proactively collects information when requirements\nchange. For best practices on how to communicate to your connected accounts when\nthat happens, visit the [guide for Standard\naccounts](https://support.stripe.com/questions/best-practices-for-connect-platforms-communicating-updates-to-verification-requirements-with-standard-or-express-connected-accounts).\n\n#### Country can't be changed\n\nAfter you create a Standard connected account, you can’t change its country.\n\n## Custom connected accounts\n\nA *Custom* connected account is almost completely invisible to the account\nholder. You—the platform—are responsible for all interactions with your\nconnected accounts, including collecting any information Stripe needs. You have\nthe ability to change all of the account’s\n[settings](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/updating-service-agreements),\nincluding the payout [bank or debit card\naccount](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/payouts-connected-accounts),\nprogrammatically.\n\nCustom connected account holders don’t have access to the Dashboard, and Stripe\ndoesn’t contact them directly.\n\nUse Custom connected accounts when you:\n\n- Want complete control over interactions with your connected accounts\n- Can build the significant infrastructure required to collect connected account\ninformation, deploy a custom dashboard, and handle support\n- Want to handle all communication with your connected accounts, involving no\ndirect contact between them and Stripe\n\nCreating and managing Custom connected accounts requires a larger integration\neffort than the other account types. To learn more, see [Using Connect with\nCustom accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom-accounts).\n\nGlobal compliance requirements do evolve and change over time. For best\npractices on how to communicate to your connected accounts when requirements\nchange, see the [guide for Custom\naccounts](https://support.stripe.com/questions/best-practices-for-connect-platforms-communicating-updates-to-verification-requirements-with-custom-connected-accounts).\n\nIf you decide to use Custom connected accounts, Stripe recommends that you use\n[Connect Onboarding for Custom\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding) to collect\nonboarding and verification information from your connected accounts. That\ndecreases your integration effort and eliminates the need to update your\nonboarding form when requirements change.\n\n### Custom connected account availability\n\nSelect one of the available countries when you create a Custom connected\naccount. You can’t change the country later.\n\nSome countries are available only when using [cross-border\npayouts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/cross-border-payouts).\n\nTo request notification when Custom connected accounts are available in your\ncountry, [contact Stripe](mailto:connect@stripe.com).\n\nAlbaniaAntigua &\nBarbudaArgentinaArmeniaAustraliaAustriaBahamasBahrainBelgiumBeninBoliviaBosnia &\nHerzegovinaBotswanaBruneiBulgariaCambodiaCanadaChileColombiaCosta RicaCôte\nd’IvoireCyprusCzech RepublicDenmarkDominican RepublicEcuadorEgyptEl\nSalvadorEstoniaEthiopiaFinlandFranceGambiaGermanyGhanaGreeceGuatemalaGuyanaHong\nKongHungaryIcelandIrelandIsraelItalyJamaicaJapanJordanKenyaKuwaitLatviaLithuaniaLuxembourgMacao\nSAR\nChinaMadagascarMaltaMauritiusMexicoMoldovaMonacoMongoliaMoroccoNamibiaNetherlandsNew\nZealandNigeriaNorth\nMacedoniaNorwayOmanPakistanPanamaParaguayPeruPhilippinesPolandPortugalQatarRomaniaRwandaSaudi\nArabiaSenegalSerbiaSingaporeSlovakiaSloveniaSouth AfricaSouth KoreaSpainSri\nLankaSt. LuciaSwedenSwitzerlandTaiwanTanzaniaThailandTrinidad &\nTobagoTunisiaTurkeyUnited Arab EmiratesUnited KingdomUnited\nStatesUruguayUzbekistanVietnam\n## See also\n\n- [Express connected accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/express-accounts)\n- [Standard connected\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/standard-accounts)\n- [Custom connected accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom-accounts)\n- [Account capabilities](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)\n- [Design an integration](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/design-an-integration)\n- [migrate your platform to support new connected accounts that are configured\nwithout types](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/migrate-to-controller-properties)\n- [Standard](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/standard-accounts)\n- [Express](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/express-accounts)\n- [Custom](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom-accounts)\n- [Extensions](https://docs.stripe.com/building-extensions)\n- [platform profile](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/settings/profile)\n- [Platform\ncontrols](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/platform-controls-for-stripe-dashboard-accounts)\n- [direct charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges#types)\n- [charge types](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges)\n- [payout settings](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/payouts-connected-accounts)\n- [payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts)\n- [destination charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges)\n- [separate charges and\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n- [home-rental\nmarketplace](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/collect-then-transfer-guide)\n- [guide for Express\naccounts](https://support.stripe.com/questions/best-practices-for-connect-platforms-communicating-updates-to-verification-requirements-with-standard-or-express-connected-accounts)\n- [cross-border payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/cross-border-payouts)\n- [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/)\n- [direct charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges)\n- [store\nbuilders](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/enable-payment-acceptance-guide)\n- [settings](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/updating-service-agreements)\n- [guide for Custom\naccounts](https://support.stripe.com/questions/best-practices-for-connect-platforms-communicating-updates-to-verification-requirements-with-custom-connected-accounts)\n- [Connect Onboarding for Custom\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding)\n- [Account capabilities](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities)",
