If you invite the seller via\nemail, the workflow starts when they submit the initial Mirakl form.\n\n- The [onboarding\njob](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/mirakl/reference#onboarding) fetches\nnewly created Mirakl shops.\n- The connector adds an onboarding link to each shop.\n- The seller finds the link in their Mirakl back office under **My Account**.\n- They complete their KYC/KYB on Stripe.\n- The seller is redirected to the `REDIRECT_ONBOARDING` URL.\n\nStripe then performs verification, asking for more information when needed. To\nhandle this, see the\n[communication](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/mirakl/onboarding-sellers#communication)\nguidelines.\n\n### Initiate the onboarding outside of Mirakl\n\nYou can build your own onboarding flow and then use the following API request to\nmap the Stripe account with the Mirakl shop:\n\n```\ncurl \\\n\t-X POST \"https://connector-url/api/mappings\" \\\n\t-H \"accept: application/json\" \\\n\t-H \"X-AUTH-TOKEN: $OPERATOR_PASSWORD\" \\\n\t-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n\t-d \"{ \\\"miraklShopId\\\": 123, \\\"stripeUserId\\\": \\\"acct_1032D82eZvKYlo2C\\\"}\"\n```\n\n## Seller account update\n\nThe workflow starts with the seller intending to update their information on\nStripe.\n\n- The seller finds the link in their Mirakl back office under **My Account**.\n- They update their information on Stripe.\n- The shop custom field is updated with a fresh login link to their [Express\ndashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/express-dashboard).\n- The KYC status is updated on Mirakl.\n\nThe last two steps are also performed when accounts are updated by the connector\nduring the [account initiation\nworkflow](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/mirakl/onboarding-sellers#account-initiation-workflow)\nor when accounts are updated by Stripe, for example, a new document needs to be\nprovided. You can receive a notification when that happens, see the [Account\nupdated](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/mirakl/reference#account-updated)\nnotification.\n\nStripe then performs verification, asking for more information when needed. To\nhandle this, see the\n[communication](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/mirakl/onboarding-sellers#communication)\nguidelines.\n\n!\n\n## Communication\n\nYou can customize the visual appearance of the Stripe form with your brand’s\nname, color, and icon in your [Connect settings\npage](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/applications/settings).\n\nBe sure to tell your sellers about the link available in their Mirakl account\nsettings and the need to complete the onboarding on Stripe to receive their\npayouts. For example, you could customize some of the email templates sent to\nyour sellers by Mirakl under **Settings** > **Notifications**.\n\nIf we require more information from your sellers, we’ll email them directly for\nExpress accounts. You must inform the sellers yourself if you decided to use\nCustom accounts.\n\n#### Note\n\nIn test environments, no emails are sent.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Integration\nsteps](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/mirakl#integration-steps).\n\n## Links\n\n- [Express](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/express-accounts)\n- [Custom](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom-accounts)\n- [transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities#transfers)\n- [Standard accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/standard-accounts)\n- [onboarding\njob](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/mirakl/reference#onboarding)\n- [Express dashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/express-dashboard)\n- [Account\nupdated](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/mirakl/reference#account-updated)\n- [Connect settings\npage](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/applications/settings)\n- [Integration\nsteps](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/mirakl#integration-steps)",
