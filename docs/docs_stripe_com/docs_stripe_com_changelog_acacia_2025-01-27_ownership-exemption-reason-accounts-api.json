  "content": "# Adds support for ownership exemption reason to the Accounts API\n\n## What’s new\n\nAdds the `ownership_exemption_reason` parameter to the\n[company](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/update#update_account-company)\nfield of the [Accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object) resource.\n\n[Ultimate beneficial\nowners](https://support.stripe.com/questions/beneficial-owner-and-director-definitions)\nare persons that, directly or indirectly, own a significant share and/or\nexercise significant control over your business. These persons are usually\nrepresented as\n[owners](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/object#person_object-relationship-owner),\n[directors](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/object#person_object-relationship-director),\nor\n[executives](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/object#person_object-relationship-executive)\non a Stripe account.\n\nTo fulfill [Know Your\nCustomer](https://support.stripe.com/questions/know-your-customer-obligations)\n(KYC) requirements, Stripe can [collect, match, and\nverify](https://support.stripe.com/questions/company-beneficial-ownership-and-director-requirement)\nthe ultimate beneficial owners for a business. Some businesses might qualify for\nan exception to the standard process for collecting and verifying ultimate\nbeneficial owners. When businesses qualify for an exception, they can submit an\n*ownership exemption reason* that resolves ultimate beneficial ownership\nrequirements and verifications from their account.\n\nAfter you submit an ownership exemption reason, Stripe verifies the exemption\nreason in lieu of verifying the ultimate beneficial owners on the account.\nStripe might reach out to either the account or the platform to collect\nadditional documentation to complete this verification.\n\nStripe currently supports two ownership exemption reasons:\n\n- `qualified_entity_exceeds_ownership_threshold`: A qualified entity or set of\nqualified entities own a significant share of the account’s business.\n- `qualifies_as_financial_institution`: The account qualifies as a financial\ninstitution.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts/{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}/ \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n-d\n\"company[ownership_exemption_reason]\"=qualified_entity_exceeds_ownership_threshold\n```\n\nThe ownership exemption reason isn’t supported in all countries. Accounts that\ncan use this process receive the `ownership_exemption_reason` requirement in\ntheir\n[requirements](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-requirements)\nfield. If verification of the ownership exemption reason fails, the account\nreceives the `verification_rejected_ownership_exemption_reason` [error\ncode](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-requirements-errors)\non the requirement and must complete the standard process for ultimate\nbeneficial ownership verification.\n\nIf providing an ownership exemption reason is supported, you see\ncountry-specific guidelines with supported reasons and their definitions.\n\nFor example, in Singapore qualified entities are defined as government entities,\npublic companies, and financial institutions. The ownership threshold is defined\nas 75%.\n\nFor an account in Singapore to declare that a qualified entity exceeds ownership\nthreshold, one or more government entities, public companies, or financial\ninstitutions must own 75% or more of the account’s company.\n\n## Impact\n\nYou can use the ownership exemption reason field to declare that your connected\naccount qualifies for an exception to the standard process for ultimate\nbeneficial ownership verification. This removes requirements and verifications\nfor ultimate beneficial owners and triggers a verification based on the\nownership exemption reason instead.\n\n## Changes\n\nREST APIRubyPythonPHPJavaNodeGo.NETParameterChangeResources or\nendpointsownership_exemption_reasonAdded[Account#create.company](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/create#create_account-company)[Account#update.company](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/update#update_account-company)[Account.company](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-company)\n+ 1 more\n## Upgrade\n\n- [View your current API\nversion](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#view-your-api-version-and-the-latest-available-upgrade-in-workbench)\nin Workbench.\n- If you use an SDK, upgrade to the corresponding SDK version for this API\nversion.- If you don’t use an SDK, update your [API\nrequests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/versioning) to include `Stripe-Version:\n2025-01-27.acacia`\n- Upgrade the API version used for [webhook\nendpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks/versioning).\n- [Test your integration](https://docs.stripe.com/testing) against the new\nversion.\n- If you use Connect, [test your Connect\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/testing).\n- In Workbench, [perform the\nupgrade](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#perform-the-upgrade).
