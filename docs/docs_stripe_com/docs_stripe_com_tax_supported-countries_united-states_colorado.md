## When to register for tax collection

See [Thresholds](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/thresholds) to get insights
about your potential tax registration obligations in Colorado. Stripe also

Remote sellers must register to collect and remit tax in Colorado when, in the
previous or current calendar year, they exceed a sales threshold of 100,000 USD.

The threshold includes retail sales, including sales of services, whether
taxable or nontaxable. The threshold excludes wholesale sales (sales for resale)
and marketplace sales.

### Other taxes

We also support:

- [Colorado Retail Delivery Fee](https://tax.colorado.gov/retail-delivery-fee)
applies to businesses making retail deliveries of taxable tangible personal
property to customers in Colorado. All motor vehicle deliveries that include at
least one taxable item require this fee. There is no revenue threshold; all
licensed retailers in Colorado must collect this fee, irrespective of their
sales volume.

## How we calculate taxes

Stripe calculates the taxes that apply to your customer’s location.

For businesses based in Colorado, Stripe calculates tax in all local
jurisdictions that levy tax, including home rule cities. Home rule cities are
cities that administer and collect their own sales tax.

For remote (out-of-state) businesses, Stripe calculates tax for all local
jurisdictions that are state administered and the home rule cities that enacted
a state-wide economic nexus threshold. This means that Stripe won’t calculate
tax for the few home rule cities that haven’t adopted economic nexus.

## Report and file your taxes

Stripe provides reports of your completed tax transactions. Go to
[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations) to access these
reports.

### Exports

The tax transaction data export provides a comprehensive and aggregated view of
transactions by location, including a breakdown of individual tax amounts. Learn
more about [tax reporting exports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports#exports).

### Location reports

[Location reports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports#us-location-reports)
offer a summary of transaction and refund data for specific US locations and
align with Colorado filing requirements. You have the option to report on an
annual, quarterly, or monthly basis.

### Filing

Stripe Tax has filing partners—Taxually, Marosa, and Hands-off Sales Tax
(HOST)—to help automate your tax filing. These partners automatically sync your
tax transaction data in real time, eliminating the need for manual data entry or
file transfers. Learn more about [tax
filing](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/filing).
