# Events for Connect now specify the originating connected account using the account fieldBreaking changes

## What’s new

Renames the `user_id` property on Connect-related event objects to `account`.

## Impact

This change replaces the `user_id` property with account on Connect-related
event objects, providing clearer terminology for Stripe Connect integrations. It
lets you more accurately identify the associated Stripe account in Connect
events.
