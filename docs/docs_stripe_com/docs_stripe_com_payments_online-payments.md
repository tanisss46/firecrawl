Accept more payment methods to help your business expand its global reach and
improve checkout conversion.

## Add Link for faster checkout

Use [Link](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link) to let your customers select a
saved payment method at checkout instead of entering payment information. Your
customers can save their credit cards, debit cards, or US bank accounts for
faster checkout at any Link-enabled business. Link also lets you accept [Instant
Bank Payments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/instant-bank-payments).
