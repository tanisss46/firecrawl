# Get support for self-service cards

## Learn who to contact for support with self-service cards.

Because of the different logos displayed on the back of our Issuing cards, it
can often be unclear who users should contact for support issues (for example
Stripe, Visa, or their platform).

Below we’ve outlined who your point of contact should be with Issuing cards
depending on your use case.

## End-user

If you’ve been provisioned a card by an entity, reach out directly to them for
support issues—Stripe can’t assist end users directly.

## Platform user

If you’re receiving questions from users of your provisioned cards, you can
[request support](https://support.stripe.com/contact/login) from Stripe. Make
sure to inform your cardholders that they need to reach out to you for support
issues.
