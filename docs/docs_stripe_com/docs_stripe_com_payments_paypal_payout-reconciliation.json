It only applies to\ncustomers receiving their funds on PayPal, and not on Stripe. Stripe\nautomatically\n[reconciles](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/payout-reconciliation) PayPal\ntransactions before the payout, whereas this can’t be done if transactions\nsettle outside of Stripe’s platform. When transactions settle outside of\nStripe’s platform, you’ll use PayPal reporting available on your PayPal account\nor with sFTP for reconciliation.\n\nStripe provides two ways of supporting PayPal transaction reconciliation:\n\n- (Recommended) Using the\n[reference](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/paypal/payout-reconciliation#use-reference)\nfield. This is the preferred option if you have a businesses-generated order or\ninvoice ID, which you can put in the reference field. After the payment is made\nand processed, `my_order_id` appears as `Invoice ID` in the PayPal settlement\nreport.\n- Using the\n[transaction_id](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/paypal/payout-reconciliation#use-transaction-id)\nfrom the\n[Charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-payment_method_details-paypal-transaction_id)\nobject. When the payment is processed, `paypal_capture_id` appears as\n`Transaction ID` in the PayPal settlement report. This is recommended only if\nyou don’t have a business-generated order ID.\n\n## Use Reference\n\nUse the\n[reference](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-payment_method_options-paypal-reference)\nfield to populate your own reference for an order on a PayPal payment. One\nexample of this is an Order ID from PayPal. This reference is visible to the\nbuyer and also in the [settlement\nreport](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/reports/sftp-reports/settlement-report/)\non your PayPal account. To reconcile funds using a `reference`, you can include\nit as part of the\n[payment_method_options](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-payment_method_options-paypal)\nparameter when creating a PaymentIntent. You can use this `reference` to match\npayments made through Stripe with corresponding transactions in the [PayPal\nsettlement\nreport](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/reports/sftp-reports/settlement-report/).\nAny subsequent transactions derived from the original Payment transaction, such\nas refunds and disputes, are associated with the given `reference`.\n\nThe following code sample shows the creation of a PaymentIntent with the\n`reference` set in `payment_method_options`:\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d amount=1099 \\\n -d currency=eur \\\n -d \"payment_method_types[]\"=paypal \\\n -d \"payment_method_options[paypal][reference]\"=my_order_id\n```\n\nAfter the payment is made and processed, `my_order_id` is reflected as Invoice\nID in the [PayPal settlement\nreport](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/reports/sftp-reports/settlement-report/).\n\n## Use the Charge object’s transaction ID\n\nThe\n[transaction_id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-payment_method_details-paypal-transaction_id)\nfield contains the ID used by PayPal to identify a transaction. To reconcile\nfunds using a `transaction_id`, retrieve the `transaction_id` from the\n[payment_method_details](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-payment_method_details-paypal)\nfield in the Charge object. The `transaction_id` is present only if the payment\nhas been captured. It’s used to match payments made through Stripe with\ncorresponding transactions in the [PayPal settlement\nreport](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/reports/sftp-reports/settlement-report/).\n\nFor example, here’s how you can retrieve the `transaction_id` from the Charge\nobject:\n\n```\n{\n \"amount\": 1099,\n \"amount_captured\": 1099,\n \"payment_method_details\": {\n \"paypal\": {\n \"transaction_id\": \"paypal_capture_id\",\n \"payer_id\": \"ZA889USQQDD37\",\n \"payer_email\": \"jenny@example.com\",\n \"payer_name\": \"Jenny Rosen\"\n },\n \"type\": \"paypal\"\n },\n \"balance_transaction\": \"txn_3MrOPxGsnWT9WMaQ19vg30v3\",\n \"billing_details\": {\n \"address\": {\n \"city\": \"Co. Kerry\",\n \"country\": \"IE\",\n \"line1\": \"Skellig Michael\",\n \"line2\": \"Great Skellig\",\n \"postal_code\": \"12345\",\n```\n\nSee all 52 lines\nWhen the payment is processed, `paypal_capture_id` is appears as `Transaction\nID` in the [PayPal settlement\nreport](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/reports/sftp-reports/settlement-report/).\n\n## Access your PayPal reports\n\nYou can download your PayPal Settlement Report and other reports from\npaypal.com, or you can enable sFTP reporting by contacting PayPal.\n\nThe Settlement Report provides an end-to-end view of all balance-impacting\ntransactions within a 24-hour period. This report is used to reconcile money\nmoving events in a PayPal account with monies that are moved to a linked bank\naccount.\n\nTo access the Settlement report:\n\n- [Log in](https://www.paypal.com/signin) to your PayPal business account.\n- Under **Activity**, select **All Reports**.\n- Select **Transactions > Settlement**.\n\nRead more about [PayPal reports and how to download\nthem](https://www.paypal.com/us/cshelp/article/how-do-i-view-and-download-statements-and-reports-help145).\n\n## Links\n\n- [reconciles](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/payout-reconciliation)\n-\n[Charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-payment_method_details-paypal-transaction_id)\n-\n[reference](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-payment_method_options-paypal-reference)\n- [settlement\nreport](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/reports/sftp-reports/settlement-report/)\n-\n[payment_method_options](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-payment_method_options-paypal)\n-\n[payment_method_details](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-payment_method_details-paypal)\n- [Log in](https://www.paypal.com/signin)\n- [PayPal reports and how to download\nthem](https://www.paypal.com/us/cshelp/article/how-do-i-view-and-download-statements-and-reports-help145)",
