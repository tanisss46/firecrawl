We\nrecommend that you configure your payment methods from the Stripe Dashboard\nusing the instructions in [Accept a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web&ui=stripe-hosted).\n\nIf you want to continue manually configuring the payment methods you present to\nyour customers with Checkout, use this guide. Otherwise, update your integration\nto [configure payment methods in the\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/dashboard-payment-methods).\n\n[Determine\ncompatibility](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/au-becs-debit/accept-a-payment#compatibility)\nTo support BECS Direct Debit payments in Checkout,\n[Prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices) for all line items must be\nexpressed in Australian dollars (currency code `aud`).\n\n[Accept a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/au-becs-debit/accept-a-payment#accept-a-payment)\n#### Note\n\nBuild an integration to [accept a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?integration=checkout)\nwith Checkout before using this guide.\n\nUse this guide to learn how to enable BECS Direct Debit—it shows the differences\nbetween accepting a card payment and using BECS Direct Debit.\n\n### Enable BECS Direct Debit as a payment method\n\nWhen creating a new [Checkout\nSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions), you need to:\n\n- Add `au_becs_debit` to the list of `payment_method_types`\n- Make sure all your `line_items` use the `aud` currency\n\n```\nStripe::Checkout::Session.create({\n mode: 'payment',\n payment_method_types: ['card'],\n payment_method_types: ['card', 'au_becs_debit'],\n line_items: [{\n price_data: {\n currency: 'usd',\n # To accept `au_becs_debit`, all line items must have currency: aud\n currency: 'aud',\n product_data: {\n name: 'T-shirt',\n },\n unit_amount: 2000,\n },\n quantity: 1,\n }],\n success_url: 'https://example.com/success',\n cancel_url: 'https://example.com/cancel',\n})\n```\n\n### Fulfill your orders\n\nAfter accepting a payment, learn how to [fulfill\norders](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/fulfillment).\n\n[Test your\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/au-becs-debit/accept-a-payment#test-integration)\n#### Note\n\nYou’ll want to use the [BECS Direct Debit test\nnumbers](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/au-becs-debit/accept-a-payment#test-integration)\nwhen testing your Checkout integration with BECS Direct Debit.\n\nThere are several test numbers you can use to make sure your integration is\nready for production.\n\nBSB NumberAccount NumberDescription`000-000``000123456`The PaymentIntent status\ntransitions from `processing` to `succeeded`.
