The threshold excludes sales of\nnontaxable services and marketplace sales.\n\n## Register to collect tax\n\nRegister for sales tax in Puerto Rico at the [tax\nauthority](https://suri.hacienda.pr.gov/_/).\n\nAfter you’ve registered to collect tax in Puerto Rico, go to\n[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations?location=us-pr)\nto add your registrations to Stripe in the Dashboard.

Your\ncustomers in Puerto Rico will be asked for a country + postal code for the\ntransaction to go ahead.\n\n### If you started using Tax on or before May 12, 2023\n\nYou won’t be able to turn on tax collection for Puerto Rico yet. If you don’t\nuse Payment Links or Checkout, some customer addresses in these locations might\nnot contain all the detail needed for tax calculation. Invoicing, Subscriptions,\nand custom payment integrations won’t require the postal code automatically.\n\nWe’ve released a tool that enables you to export your customer addresses and see\nwhich addresses won’t have the required address information for tax calculation\nin Puerto Rico. Use the form below to request access. If you have existing\nsubscriptions, update any customer addresses to include a postal code. If you\ndon’t update this information, the [invoice won’t\nfinalize](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/customer-locations#finalizing-invoices-with-finalization-failures)\nand the payment won’t be collected.\n\n## Report and file your taxes\n\nStripe provides reports of your completed tax transactions. Go to\n[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations) to access these\nreports.\n\n### Exports\n\nThe tax transaction data export provides a comprehensive and aggregated view of\ntransactions by location, including a breakdown of individual tax amounts.
