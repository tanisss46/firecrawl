If you aren’t familiar with Stripe Connect, we\nrecommend going through the [Connect\noverview](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/how-connect-works).\n\nThere are two options for integrating Terminal with Connect, depending on [the\naccount type you choose](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/accounts) for your\nplatform’s connected accounts. To decide which option best suits your business’s\nneeds, refer to the following table:\n\nCustom or ExpressStandardWho owns the API resources?PlatformConnected\naccountsWho has access to [the Terminal hardware ordering dashboard and\nAPIs](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/fleet/order-and-return-readers)?PlatformConnected\naccountsWhich [charge types](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges#types) can\nI use?- [Destination\ncharges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges)\n- [Separate\ncharges/transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n- [Direct charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges)\n\n## Express or Custom Connect\n\nIn a Connect integration with Express or Custom accounts, all API resources\nbelong to the platform account. As needed, you can associate Terminal objects\nlike [Readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers) and\n[Locations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/locations) with a particular\nconnected account by including them in the\n[metadata](https://docs.stripe.com/api/metadata) object on these resources.\n\n!\n\nWhen processing payments, you specify the connected account as the destination\nfor the funds using the `on_behalf_of`, `transfer_data[destination]`, and\n`application_fee_amount` parameters. This creates a transfer to the connected\naccount automatically and establishes the connected account as the merchant of\nrecord.\n\n## Standard Connect\n\nIn a Connect integration with Standard accounts, all API resources belong to\nindividual connected accounts. When making API requests such as for creating\nlocations, readers, and payments, you pass the connected account ID in the\n`Stripe-Account` header. This tells Stripe that the request is effectively being\nmade by the connected account.\n\n!\n\nWhen processing payments, you also pass the connected account’s ID in the\n`Stripe-Account` header, which creates the charge directly on the connected\naccount.\n\n## Next steps\n\n- [Build a sample integration](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/quickstart)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Stripe Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)\n- [Connect overview](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/how-connect-works)\n- [the account type you choose](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/accounts)\n- [the Terminal hardware ordering dashboard and\nAPIs](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/fleet/order-and-return-readers)\n- [charge types](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges#types)\n- [Destination charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges)\n- [Separate\ncharges/transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n- [Direct charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges)\n- [Readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers)\n- [Locations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/locations)\n- [metadata](https://docs.stripe.com/api/metadata)\n- [Build a sample integration](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/quickstart)",
