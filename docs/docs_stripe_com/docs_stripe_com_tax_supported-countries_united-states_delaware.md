# Collect tax from Delaware

## Learn how to use Stripe Tax to calculate, collect, and report tax from Delaware.

## When to register for tax collection

Delaware doesn’t have a general state or local sales tax. This means you won’t
see an option to add your registration for Delaware to Stripe and collect taxes
from your customers based in Delaware.

However Delaware does impose other taxes on businesses, including a gross
receipts tax. Learn more about the taxes that apply in Delaware at the [tax
authority](https://revenue.delaware.gov/services-for-the-business-taxpayer/).

If you’re a business based in Delaware you could still have tax obligations
based on sales to customers in other locations. See
[Thresholds](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/thresholds) to get insights about
your potential tax registration obligations. Stripe also notifies you with email
and Dashboard alerts when you need to register to collect tax. Learn more about
how the [monitoring tool works](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/monitoring).

## Register to collect tax

Read more about registering for [sales tax in the US in our
guide](https://stripe.com/guides/sales-tax-registration-process-us). You may
need to register to collect tax on your sales in other states or countries.

After you’ve registered to collect tax in a location, go to
[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations?location=us-de)
to add your registrations to Stripe in the Dashboard. This turns on tax
calculation and collection in Stripe for your transactions in that location.

Learn [how to add your
registration](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/registering#track-your-registrations-in-the-tax-dashboard)
in the Dashboard.

## How we calculate taxes

If your [origin address](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/set-up#origin-address) is
in the US and differs from your customer’s state, Stripe always calculates tax
based on your customer’s location.

If your origin address is in the US and in the same state as your customer’s
state, Stripe generally calculates sales tax based on your customer’s location.

## Report and file your taxes

Stripe Tax has filing partners—Taxually, Marosa, and Hands-off Sales Tax
(HOST)—to help automate your tax filing. These partners automatically sync your
tax transaction data in real time, eliminating the need for manual data entry or
file transfers. Learn more about [tax
filing](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/filing).

Stripe also provides reports of your completed tax transactions. Go to
[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations) to access these
reports. Learn more about [the different types of
reports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports).
