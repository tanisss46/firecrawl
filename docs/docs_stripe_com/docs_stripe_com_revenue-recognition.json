Generally\naccepted accounting principles (GAAP) state that you recognize revenue when you\nrealize and earn it, which might be earlier or later than when you actually\nreceive cash. Correctly recognizing and deferring revenue enables you to have\nthe most accurate insights into your business profitability and financial\nhealth.\n\n## Who needs revenue recognition\n\nRevenue recognition is critical for many types of businesses, especially:\n\n- Public companies or large businesses with over 25 million USD in annual\nrevenue—because they’re legally required to comply with ASC 606 and GAAP and\nIFRS accounting standards.\n- Startups that need to follow accrual accounting to raise money from investors\nor get a loan from a bank.\n- Subscription and service-based businesses.\n- Businesses where customers pay up front before receiving a good or service.\n\nRevenue recognition can provide these businesses with a clear picture of their\nperformance.\n\nRevenue recognition gets complicated quickly as businesses scale with larger\nproduct lines and increased payment volumes. For subscription businesses that\nneed to manage changes, refunds, disputes, and prorations, revenue recognition\ncan be especially complex. Such subscription updates can complicate the process\nof recognizing and deferring revenue accurately and compliantly.\n\n### New accounting standards\n\nOn May 28, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and\nInternational Accounting Standards Board (IASB) jointly issued [Accounting\nStandards Codification (ASC) 606](https://asc.fasb.org/606/tableOfContent), a\nnew framework for businesses to recognize revenue from contracts with customers.\n\n## Stripe Revenue Recognition\n\nStripe Revenue Recognition helps you simplify the process of recognizing revenue\nwithout the need for engineering involvement or lengthy configurations.
