Twice a\nyear, we issue a new release (for example, `acacia`) that starts with an API\nversion that will have breaking changes.\n\nYou can expect new minor versions of the SDKs with each monthly API version and\nnew major versions of the SDKs with each of the twice a year major releases.\n\nYou may sometimes see a major version update to the SDKs with the monthly API\nversion updates if the SDKs have breaking changes to ship.\n\nTo understand what to expect from a new API version, see [API\nupgrades](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades).\n\n## Stripe SDK versions\n\nStripe’s SDK versioning policy is based on the semantic versioning standard. For\nexample, in version 4.3.2, 4 is the *major*, 3 is the *minor*, and 2 is the\n*patch*. When we release a new SDK version for new features or bug fixes, we\nincrement one of these three version components depending on the type of change\nintroduced.\n\n- **Major**. We increment the *major* version component when the version\ncontains breaking changes that are backwards incompatible with the latest\nversion: to add a required parameter, change a type, property, method, or\nparameter. For example, renaming the SDK’s exception classes.\n- **Minor**. We increment the *minor* version component when the version\ncontains new features that are backwards compatible with the latest version: to\nadd a new type, property, method, optional parameter, or supported parameter\nvalue. For example, clarifying the SDK’s metadata deletion message.\n- **Patch**. We increment the *patch* version component when the version\ncontains backward-compatible bug fixes: to modify a behavior if correcting that\nbehavior doesn’t change any documented types, properties, methods, or\nparameters. For example, fixing a bug where file uploads weren’t listed\nproperly.\n\nYou can test new features and enhancements in the\n[preview](https://docs.stripe.com/release-phases) stage by using versions of our\nSDKs that have the beta or b suffix. For example, 5.1.0b3 in Python and\n5.1.0-beta.3 in other language SDKs.\n\nFor installation instructions or details about passing preview headers in the\nStripe-Version header, check the README files in the respective SDK GitHub\nrepositories.\n\n## Stripe SDK support policy\n\nNew features and bug fixes are released on the latest *major* version of the\nSDK. If you’re on an older *major* SDK version, we recommend upgrading to the\nlatest major version to take advantage of these features and bug fixes. Older\nmajor versions of the package continue to be available for use, but won’t\nreceive any additional updates.\n\n### Migration guides\n\nWe provide migration guides to help you upgrade from older major SDK versions.\nYou can find them in the wiki section of our SDK GitHub repositories.\n\n- [Python SDK wiki](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-python/wiki)\n- [.NET SDK wiki](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-dotnet/wiki)\n- [Java SDK wiki](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-java/wiki)\n- [Go SDK wiki](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-go/wiki)\n- [PHP SDK wiki](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-php/wiki)\n- [Ruby SDK wiki](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ruby/wiki)\n- [Node.js SDK wiki](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-node/wiki)\n\n## See also\n\n- [Set a Stripe API version](https://docs.stripe.com/sdks/set-version)\n\n## Links\n\n- [new API release\nprocess](https://stripe.com/blog/introducing-stripes-new-api-release-process)\n- [API upgrades](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades)\n- [preview](https://docs.stripe.com/release-phases)\n- [Python SDK wiki](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-python/wiki)\n- [.NET SDK wiki](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-dotnet/wiki)\n- [Java SDK wiki](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-java/wiki)\n- [Go SDK wiki](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-go/wiki)\n- [PHP SDK wiki](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-php/wiki)\n- [Ruby SDK wiki](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ruby/wiki)\n- [Node.js SDK wiki](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-node/wiki)\n- [Set a Stripe API version](https://docs.stripe.com/sdks/set-version)",
