Only\n[ending free trial periods without a payment\nmethod](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/trials#create-free-trials-without-payment)\ncause subscriptions to enter a [paused\nstatus](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview#subscription-statuses).\n\nPausing payment collection is often used to temporarily offer your services for\nfree. This is sometimes referred to as a “grace period” if a customer needs\nadditional time to pay or can’t pay for one or more billing cycles.\n\nYou can pause or resume collection in the [Stripe\nDashboard](https://support.stripe.com/questions/how-to-pause-or-cancel-subscriptions)\nor the API. While collection is paused,\n[subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating) still\ngenerate [invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices), but you have a few\noptions for handling these invoices. Review the following use cases to determine\nthe best approach for you:\n\nUse caseAPI configuration[Temporarily offer services for free and never collect\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/pause-payment#collect-payment-never)Use\n`behavior=void`[Temporarily offer services for free and collect payment\nlater](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/pause-payment#collect-payment-later)Use\n`behavior=keep_as_draft`[Temporarily offer services for free and mark invoice as\nuncollectible](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/pause-payment#mark-as-uncollectible)Use\n`behavior=mark_uncollectible`\nIf these options don’t fit your use case, you might want to consider [canceling\nsubscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/cancel) instead.\n\nInvoices created before subscriptions are paused continue to be\n[retried](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/automatic-collection) unless you\n[void](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/void) them.\n\n## Temporarily offer services for free and never collect payment\n\nIf you temporarily want to offer your services for free and you don’t want to\ncollect payment on the invoice (for example, a “grace period”), you can void\ninvoices that your subscription creates to make sure that your customers aren’t\ncharged and the subscription remains `status=active`. Use the Subscription ID to\nupdate `pause_collection[behavior]` to `void` and `pause_collection[resumes_at]`\nto the date you want to start collecting payments again.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscriptions/{{SUBSCRIPTION_ID}} \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d \"pause_collection[behavior]\"=void\n```\n\nAll invoices created before the `resumes_at` date are immediately marked as\nvoid. Stripe won’t send any upcoming invoice emails or webhooks and the\nsubscription’s status remains unchanged.\n\nIf you don’t set a `resumes_at` date, the subscription remains paused until you\nunset `pause_collection`.\n\n## Temporarily offer services for free and collect payment later\n\nIf you want to temporarily offer your services for free and collect payments\nlater, set `pause_collection[behavior]=keep_as_draft`. If you know when you want\nto resume collection, pass a timestamp for `resumes_at`.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscriptions/{{SUBSCRIPTION_ID}} \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d \"pause_collection[behavior]\"=keep_as_draft\n```\n\nAll invoices created before the `resumes_at` date remain in `draft` state and\n`auto_advance` is set to `false`. During this time, Stripe won’t send any\nupcoming invoice emails or webhooks for these invoices and the subscription’s\nstatus remains unchanged.\n\nIf you don’t set a `resumes_at` date, the subscription remains paused until you\nunset `pause_collection`.\n\n#### Caution\n\nIf you have custom logic that finalizes invoices you might need to disable or\nmodify it so that it doesn’t conflict with these settings.\n\nWhen you’re ready to collect payment for these invoices, set `auto_advance` back\nto `true`. If you don’t have the invoice IDs, you can use Subscription IDs to\ncheck for invoices with `status=draft`. Using the invoice ID, you can then\nupdate `auto_advance=true`:\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/invoices/{{INVOICE_ID}} \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d auto_advance=true\n```\n\n## Temporarily offer services for free and mark invoices as uncollectible\n\nIf you temporarily want to offer your services for free and mark any invoices\ngenerated by the subscription as uncollectible, use the Subscription ID to\nupdate `pause_collection[behavior]` to `mark_uncollectible` and optionally\n`pause_collection[resumes_at]` to the date you want to start collecting payments\nagain. This makes sure that any downstream reporting is accurate, your customer\nisn’t charged, and the subscription remains `status=active`.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscriptions/{{SUBSCRIPTION_ID}} \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d \"pause_collection[behavior]\"=mark_uncollectible\n```\n\nIf you set `pause_collection[behavior]` to `mark_uncollectible`, we’ll stop\nactive payment collection on new invoices the subscription creates before the\n`resumes_at` date. Stripe won’t send any upcoming invoice emails or webhooks for\nthese invoices.\n\nDespite this pause, Stripe applies any existing customer balance to invoices.\nThis behavior helps use available funds before we mark an invoice as\n`uncollectible`. If the invoice’s `total` is paid off entirely using customer\nbalance, then the invoice’s status is set to `paid`. Otherwise, the invoice’s\nstatus is set to `uncollectible`.\n\nIf you don’t set a `resumes_at` date, the payment collection on the subscription\nremains paused until you unset `pause_collection`.\n\n## Manually unpausing\n\nTo resume collecting payments at any time, you can update the subscription and\nunset `pause_collection`:\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscriptions/sub_GTbTiykEwMRog0 \\\n -u sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2: \\\n -d \"pause_collection\"=\n```\n\nResuming collection this way only affects future invoices.\n\n## Pausing and subscription schedules\n\nIf you pause a subscription on a [subscription\nschedule](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/subscription-schedules),\nthe scheduled updates still take effect. However, payment is not collected while\nthe subscription is paused. When you want to collect payment again, you need to\n[manually\nunpause](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/pause-payment#unpausing)\nthe subscription. You also need to update `auto_advance` to `true` on any\ninvoices with `status=draft` that you want to collect payment on.\n\n## Links\n\n- [ending free trial periods without a payment\nmethod](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/trials#create-free-trials-without-payment)\n- [paused\nstatus](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview#subscription-statuses)\n- [Stripe\nDashboard](https://support.stripe.com/questions/how-to-pause-or-cancel-subscriptions)\n- [subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating)\n- [invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n- [canceling\nsubscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/cancel)\n- [retried](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/automatic-collection)\n- [void](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/void)\n- [subscription\nschedule](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/subscription-schedules)",
