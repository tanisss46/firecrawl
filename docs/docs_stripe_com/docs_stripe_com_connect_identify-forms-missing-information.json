  "content": "# Remediate missing tax information\n\n## Learn how to find and correct forms with missing information.\n\nStripe automatically identifies forms that are above the IRS or state filing\nthresholds. In addition to the totals, a 1099 form also needs to have the name,\naddress, and TIN of the connected account on the form to be ready for filing.\n\nIf a form is above the threshold (has a filing obligation) and has the **name**,\n**address**, and **TIN** on the form, Stripe labels the form `Ready`:\n\n![Ready\nlabel.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/identity_1.7c55d26b4ecfd38740e2de9acd0ff5b3.png)\n\nIf you need to file a form but the form is missing this key information, Stripe\nlabels the form `Needs attention`:\n\n![Needs attention\nlabel.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/identity_2.c7b46cd05ee19f79cc1f7a4c19a205f5.png)\n\nRefer to the [Get started with tax\nreporting](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-tax-reporting#understand-tax-form-status)\nguide to learn more about tax form statuses.\n\nThe following information describes how to track what forms have `Needs\nattention` status, why they have that status, and what to do to get their status\nto `Ready`.\n\n## Identity forms in that need attention\n\nThe **Needs attention** tab lists all forms with a `Needs attention` status.\n\n![Needs attention\ntab.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/identity_3.0ec06ddc52465f44465ff9c5a22057b0.png)\n\n#### Note\n\nSome forms that appear to be below the federal filing threshold can also appear\nas `Ready` or `Needs attention` due to Grouped TINs or state filing thresholds.\n[Learn\nmore](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/file-tax-forms#below-threshold-forms)\n\nThe **Payee details** section lists the missing data that causes the form to\nhave a `Needs attention` status:\n\n![Payee details\nsection.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/identity_4.bd8c5d5254cb44977f15b2f84d494a14.png)\n\nRefer to the [Required verification information for\ntaxes](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information-taxes)\nguide for information on what information is needed for each form.\n\nThe reasons a form might have a `Needs attention` status include:\n\n- **Missing address:** The *line1*, *city*, *state,* or *postal code* is\nmissing.\n- **Missing TIN:** The TIN is missing.\n- **Mismatched TIN:** The name and TIN are present on the form, but failed\nStripe’s TIN verification with the IRS as they didn’t match IRS records. [Learn\nmore about Tax form TIN\nstatus](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-tax-reporting#understand-tax-form-tin-status).\n- **Missing name:** The name is missing from the account. This reason is rare.\n\nUse the filter to retrieve forms based on the reason for the `Needs attention`\nstatus:\n\n![Filter forms by\nstatus](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/identity_5.9cd7b0b5fff7639007ae9e507504d00f.png)\n\n## Remediation options\n\nThere are several ways to fix forms that need attention.\n\n## Scenario A: You’re able to retrieve the data\n\nThese are your options if you already have this data or able to retrieve it\noutside of Stripe.\n\n- **Option 1 Recommended:** If you already have this data in your internal\nsystems, or have a way to reach out to your connected account owners to collect\nthis information directly, use the [Accounts\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/update) to send that data to Stripe.\nMake sure these required\n[fields](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information-taxes)\nare present on the Accounts API. After you send the data to Stripe, it appears\nin the tax form within 24-36 hours, and the form automatically transitions from\n`Needs attention` to `Ready`.\n- **Option 2:** Use [CSV\nimports](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/modify-tax-forms?method=csv) to get\nthis data into the current year’s tax forms. If the CSV process imports all of\nthe required information, the tax form automatically transitions from `Needs\nattention` to `Ready`. Importing these details using CSV only updates this\ninformation on the tax form, and doesn’t update the source of truth within\nStripe. As a result, the connected account details view doesn’t show these\nupdates.\n- **Option 3**: If you need to update only a few forms, you can choose to\ndirectly modify the forms in the Dashboard using the [Tax Form\nEditor](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/modify-tax-forms?method=dashboard).\n\n## Scenario B: You want Stripe to help get the data\n\nThese are your options if you don’t have the required information and you want\nStripe to help you obtain this data. Stripe recommends using both options to for\nthe best chance of collecting all the information for filing.\n\n- **Option 1:** If you enable e-delivery through an interface built by Stripe,\nconnected account owners eligible for IRS filing receive emails from Stripe\nrequesting confirmation of their tax information and to update their delivery\npreferences through that interface. If you implemented Connect embedded\ncomponents, the email directs them to the embedded component. Otherwise, it\ndirects them to the [Stripe Express\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/platform-express-dashboard-taxes-walkthrough).\nConnected account owners can then view and edit their personal details,\nincluding name, address, and TIN.\n\n![Tax form confirm information\nemail.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/tax-form-confirm-information-email-2023.8868bb92bbd3f2fd5fa0e2fe319c11ab.png)\n\n![Confirm\ninformation.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/identity_7.1801e85e31759f80b4e3ffd7fe974778.png)\n- **Option 2:** Use Stripe Onboarding to collect missing details\n\n- Add the 1099 capability on your accounts\n[programmatically](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities#tax-reporting)\nor\n[one-by-one](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard/managing-individual-accounts#updating-capabilities)\nusing the Connect Dashboard. By adding the 1099 capability, you make name,\naddress, and TIN a requirement on all your connected accounts. If your connected\naccounts have more than 600 USD in lifetime volume and don’t have name, address,\nand verified TIN on file, payouts are paused until Stripe has that information.-\nThere’s another feature in private preview called Additional Verifications that\nallows platforms to add TIN and address requirements on their connected\naccounts, along with flexibility on when to disable payouts. Reach out to your\naccount manager to learn more.\n- You can route your user to a Stripe surface to complete their requirements.-\nFor accounts with access to the Express Dashboard or embedded components where\nStripe owns the requirement collection, Stripe automatically detects when there\nare `currently_due` requirements (such as address or TIN) on the account and\nsends the connected account owner an email.\n- For other accounts without access to a Stripe Dashboard, including Custom\naccounts, create [account\nlinks](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links/create) and route your users to\nStripe onboarding for Custom accounts.\n\n![Verify your personal\ndetails.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/identity_8.1dc79629776f61a43b06d68a583d6aa4.png)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Get started with tax\nreporting](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-tax-reporting#understand-tax-form-status)\n- [Learn\nmore](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/file-tax-forms#below-threshold-forms)\n- [Required verification information for\ntaxes](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information-taxes)\n- [Learn more about Tax form TIN\nstatus](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-tax-reporting#understand-tax-form-tin-status)\n- [Accounts API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/update)\n- [CSV imports](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/modify-tax-forms?method=csv)\n- [Tax Form\nEditor](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/modify-tax-forms?method=dashboard)\n- [Stripe Express\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/platform-express-dashboard-taxes-walkthrough)\n-\n[programmatically](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities#tax-reporting)\n-\n[one-by-one](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard/managing-individual-accounts#updating-capabilities)\n- [account links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links/create)",
