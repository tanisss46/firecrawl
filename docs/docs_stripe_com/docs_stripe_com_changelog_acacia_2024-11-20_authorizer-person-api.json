  "content": "# Adds support for authorizers to Person API\n\n## What’s new\n\nAdds the authorizer role as a parameter in the `relationship` field of the\nPerson API.\n\nThe Stripe account\n[representative](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/object#person_object-relationship)\nis defined as the person that’s authorized to act as the primary representative\nof the account. This person provides information about themselves and is\ndesignated by the business to provide general information about the account.\n\nTo fulfill [Know Your\nCustomer](https://support.stripe.com/questions/know-your-customer-obligations)\n(KYC) requirements, Stripe might be required to verify the [authority of the\nrepresentative](https://support.stripe.com/questions/representative-authority-verification).\nIf the representative on the Stripe account doesn’t match a registered\nrepresentative for the business, you can add an authorizer to the account to\ngrant them authority to represent the business.\n\nAn authorizer is usually a person that qualifies as a registered representative\nfor the business, but isn’t listed as a representative on the business Stripe\naccount. Stripe might request additional information, such as a [company\nauthorization\ndocument](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create#create_person-documents-company_authorization),\nthat allows the authorizer to transfer authority (to authorize) the\nrepresentative.\n\nThere can only be one authorizer on a Stripe account. The authorizer can’t be\nthe account representative. This role is only available in countries where the\nauthorizer can transfer authority to the representative.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts/acct_xxxxx/persons \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d first_name=John \\\n -d last_name=Doe \\\n -d \"relationship[authorizer]\"=true\n```\n\n## Impact\n\nYou can use the new authorizer `relationship` field to create an authorizer for\nyour connected accounts. Use this authorizer to satisfy authority verification\nrequirements on your connected account.\n\n## Changes\n\nREST APIRubyPythonPHPJavaNodeGo.NETParameterChangeResources or\nendpointsauthorizerAdded[Account#persons.relationship](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list#list_person-relationship)[Token#create.person.relationship](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_person#create_person_token-person-relationship)\n## Upgrade\n\n- [View your current API\nversion](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#view-your-api-version-and-the-latest-available-upgrade-in-workbench)\nin Workbench.\n- If you use an SDK, upgrade to the corresponding SDK version for this API\nversion.- If you don’t use an SDK, update your [API\nrequests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/versioning) to include `Stripe-Version:\n2024-11-20.acacia`\n- Upgrade the API version used for [webhook\nendpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks/versioning).\n- [Test your integration](https://docs.stripe.com/testing) against the new\nversion.\n- If you use Connect, [test your Connect\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/testing).\n- In Workbench, [perform the\nupgrade](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#perform-the-upgrade).
