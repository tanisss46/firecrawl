# Control billing details collection

## Customize the billing details you collect within the Payment Element.

You can collect billing details several ways with the Payment Element:

- `never`: Don’t collect any billing details in the Payment Element. You can set
this for all
[fields](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_payment_element#payment_element_create-options-fields)
or on specific fields subcomponents, like `name`, `email`, and `address`.
- `if_required`: Collect only the address fields required for each payment
method to complete the payment.
- `auto` (default): Stripe determines which billing fields to collect based on
customer friction and authorization success rate for each payment method. You
don’t need to pass in additional billing details at confirm time for this mode.

By default, all fields are set to `auto`. This balances minimizing customer
friction and maintaining optimal authorization rates.

## Hide billing details

If you’re collecting billing details elsewhere outside of the Payment Element,
you can use `never` to avoid collecting billing details entirely or to skip
specific billing fields. Fields that are set to `never` are hidden for all the
payment methods. Here’s an example:

```
const paymentElement = elements.create('payment', {
 fields: {
 billingDetails: {
 // No address field will be collected in any of the payment method forms
 address: 'never',
 }
 }
});
```

When `never` is set, you must manually pass in the omitted billing fields at the
confirmation time:

```
stripe.confirmPayment({
 //...Other values
 payment_method: {
 billing_details: {
 address: {
 line1: '123 Main Street',
 city: 'Anytown',
 country: 'US',
 postal_code: '12345'
 },
 }
 } 
});
```

## Collect minimal billing details

Specify `if_required` to collect only the billing address fields needed to
complete payment for each payment method.

This option helps reduce customer friction but might come with certain
trade-offs, such as higher network fees, for users on a network cost plus
pricing plan, and potential impacts on authorization rates.

```
const paymentElement = elements.create('payment', {
 fields: {
 billingDetails: {
 address: 'if_required',
 }
 }
});
```

## Advanced: using Address Element in billing mode

If your business requires collecting the full billing address, you can use the
[Address Element](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/address-element) billing mode
in combination with the Payment Element. The billing details gathered in Address
Element are automatically attached at the confirmation time.
