# Introduces the statement_description field and logic for how charges, invoices, plans, and transfers render statement descriptorsBreaking changes

## What’s new

Replaces the `statement_description` property on the `Charge`, `Invoice`,
`Plan`, and `Transfer` objects with `statement_descriptor`. To determine what
appears on a customer’s transaction, `statement_description` is appended to your
Stripe account’s statement descriptor while `statement_descriptor` sets the full
statement value. If not on this API version or newer, providing a
`statement_descriptor` still triggers the `statement_description` behavior.
Regardless of API version, the `statement_description` behavior doesn’t apply
with PaymentIntents.

## Impact

Replacing the `statement_description` property with `statement_descriptor` on
multiple objects offers more control over statement appearance.
