Follow\nthe\n[installation](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/bigcommerce/installation#install-bigcommerce-stripe-app)\nsteps again.\n- Verify that the customer you added is in a market configured in the [Provider\ntargeting tax\nsetting](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/bigcommerce/configuration#configure-country-list).\n- Verify that the customer’s address is located in one of the registered\nlocations. Many businesses miss or skip this step.\n- Verify your [tax\nregistrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations) in the Stripe\nDashboard.\n- Verify that the customer isn’t\n[tax-exempt](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/bigcommerce/configuration#configure-customer-tax-exemptions).\n- Verify where your tax is calculated. Some product tax codes might use the\nseller’s address instead of the shipping address for tax calculations. Check the\n[Dashboard logs](https://dashboard.stripe.com/logs?path=/v1/tax/calculations) to\ndetermine the exact location where your taxes are applied.(Recommended) Select a\nproduct tax code with a description that closely matches your product. This is\nimportant because incorrect tax calculations often occur when selecting a\ngeneral product tax code instead of a specific one. For example, selecting\n`General - Services` when a more specific category applies can result in taxes\ncalculated based on the seller’s location. Selecting the most accurate tax code\nensures taxes are calculated correctly.\n\nFor more information about why Stripe Tax applies zero tax to some calculations,\nsee [Zero tax amounts](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/zero-tax).\n\nIf you’re still experiencing issues after following these troubleshooting steps,\nyou can [contact us](mailto:stripe-tax-bigc-support@stripe.com).\n\n## See also\n\n- [Testing Stripe Tax](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/testing)\n- [Install the Stripe Tax Connector for\nBigCommerce](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/bigcommerce/installation)\n- [Configure the Stripe Tax Connector for\nBigCommerce](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/bigcommerce/configuration)\n- [BigCommerce - Automatic Tax\nSetup](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Automatic-Tax-Setup)\n\n## Links\n\n-\n[installation](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/bigcommerce/installation#install-bigcommerce-stripe-app)\n- [Provider targeting tax\nsetting](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/bigcommerce/configuration#configure-country-list)\n- [tax registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations)\n-\n[tax-exempt](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/bigcommerce/configuration#configure-customer-tax-exemptions)\n- [Dashboard logs](https://dashboard.stripe.com/logs?path=/v1/tax/calculations)\n- [Zero tax amounts](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/zero-tax)\n- [Testing Stripe Tax](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/testing)\n- [Install the Stripe Tax Connector for\nBigCommerce](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/bigcommerce/installation)\n- [Configure the Stripe Tax Connector for\nBigCommerce](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/bigcommerce/configuration)\n- [BigCommerce - Automatic Tax\nSetup](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Automatic-Tax-Setup)",
