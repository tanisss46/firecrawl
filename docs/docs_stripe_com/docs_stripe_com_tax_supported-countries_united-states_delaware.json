This means you won’t\nsee an option to add your registration for Delaware to Stripe and collect taxes\nfrom your customers based in Delaware.\n\nHowever Delaware does impose other taxes on businesses, including a gross\nreceipts tax. Learn more about the taxes that apply in Delaware at the [tax\nauthority](https://revenue.delaware.gov/services-for-the-business-taxpayer/).\n\nIf you’re a business based in Delaware you could still have tax obligations\nbased on sales to customers in other locations. See\n[Thresholds](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/thresholds) to get insights about\nyour potential tax registration obligations. Stripe also notifies you with email\nand Dashboard alerts when you need to register to collect tax. Learn more about\nhow the [monitoring tool works](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/monitoring).\n\n## Register to collect tax\n\nRead more about registering for [sales tax in the US in our\nguide](https://stripe.com/guides/sales-tax-registration-process-us). You may\nneed to register to collect tax on your sales in other states or countries.\n\nAfter you’ve registered to collect tax in a location, go to\n[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations?location=us-de)\nto add your registrations to Stripe in the Dashboard. This turns on tax\ncalculation and collection in Stripe for your transactions in that location.\n\nLearn [how to add your\nregistration](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/registering#track-your-registrations-in-the-tax-dashboard)\nin the Dashboard.\n\n## How we calculate taxes\n\nIf your [origin address](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/set-up#origin-address) is\nin the US and differs from your customer’s state, Stripe always calculates tax\nbased on your customer’s location.\n\nIf your origin address is in the US and in the same state as your customer’s\nstate, Stripe generally calculates sales tax based on your customer’s location.\n\n## Report and file your taxes\n\nStripe Tax has filing partners—Taxually, Marosa, and Hands-off Sales Tax\n(HOST)—to help automate your tax filing. These partners automatically sync your\ntax transaction data in real time, eliminating the need for manual data entry or\nfile transfers. Learn more about [tax\nfiling](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/filing).\n\nStripe also provides reports of your completed tax transactions. Go to\n[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations) to access these\nreports.
