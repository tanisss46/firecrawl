Build a\nSaaS platform or marketplace using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect) or\ninitiate subscriptions in-store with [Billing](https://docs.stripe.com/billing).\n\nStripe Terminal is available in the following countries:\n\n### Availability\n\nAustraliaAustriaBelgiumCanadaCzech\nRepublicDenmarkFinlandFranceGermanyIrelandItalyLuxembourgMalaysiaNetherlandsNew\nZealandNorwayPortugalSingaporeSpainSwedenSwitzerlandUnited KingdomUnited States\n### Available in Preview\n\nPoland\nYou can only collect payments in your local currency with [supported card\nbrands](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/collect-card-payment/supported-card-brands).\nStripe Terminal offers pre-certified readers and Tap to Pay, which allows users\nto accept in-person contactless payments with a compatible\n[iPhone](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/setup-reader/tap-to-pay?platform=ios)\nor\n[Android](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/setup-reader/tap-to-pay?platform=android)\ndevice and the Stripe Terminal SDK. Hardware must be shipped to physical\naddresses (not PO boxes). If you’re outside the available countries, you can\n[request an invite](https://stripe.com/terminal#request-invite) to test\nTerminal.\n\n## Features\n\nUse Terminal to take the complexity out of in-person payments:\n\n- **Online compatibility**: Unify your online and in-person payments in a single\nsystem.\n- **Flexible SDKs**: Use Terminal’s JavaScript, iOS, Android, or React Native\nSDK to integrate your existing point of sale (POS), or build a modern POS\ntailored to your business. Use the [server-driven\nintegration](https://support.stripe.com/questions/terminal-server-driven-integration)\nto integrate directly using the Stripe API.\n- **Reader choices**: Choose from [different\nreaders](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/setup-reader) depending on\nyour business needs.\n- **Connection types**:\n[Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/connect-reader) to your\nTerminal reader with Bluetooth, USB (Android with mobile readers only), or\ninternet, depending on your physical sales environment.\n- **Ordering and fleet management from the Stripe Dashboard**: Order\n[pre-certified\nreaders](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/fleet/order-and-return-readers) and\n[monitor your fleet of\nreaders](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/fleet/locations-and-zones) from the\nStripe Dashboard.\n\n## How Terminal works\n\nA Stripe Terminal deployment consists of four main components:\n\n- Your web-based, mobile, or desktop application\n- Your backend\n- A Stripe Terminal reader\n- The Stripe Terminal SDK\n\nThe SDK facilitates communication between your point of sale application logic,\nthe firmware running on the reader, and the Stripe API so you can accept\nin-person payments in the same way as you accept online payments with Stripe.\nThe SDK is available for JavaScript, iOS, Android applications. You can develop\ndesktop applications using a server-driven integration.\n\n!\n\nStripe Terminal offers a selection of [pre-certified\nreaders](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/setup-reader) that accept\npayment details (EMV, contactless, and swiped), encrypt sensitive card\ninformation, and return a token to your application (through the Stripe Terminal\nSDK) so you can confirm payment.\n\nStripe Terminal works only with our pre-certified card readers and compatible\nTap to Pay\n[iPhone](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/setup-reader/tap-to-pay?platform=ios)\nand\n[Android](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/setup-reader/tap-to-pay?platform=android)\ndevices. This ensures secure transactions by our end-to-end encryption, by\ndefault, and up-to-date readers through our remote management tools.\n\nYou can [order readers and\naccessories](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/fleet/order-and-return-readers)\nfrom the Stripe Dashboard and get them shipped to a location of your choice. As\na [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect) platform, you can even enable your\nconnected accounts to receive readers and accessories at their business\nlocation.\n\n## Use cases\n\nStripe Terminal is built with developers in mind. Its flexible design supports a\nwide range of use cases:\n\n- Extend your online business to the physical world.\n- Enable in-person payments for your [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)\nplatform, with readers for each connected account.\n- Collect payments in-person and use those card details for recurring online\npayments with [Billing](https://docs.stripe.com/billing).\n- Build a new, customized point of sale application or integrate with your\nexisting point of sale application, while taking advantage of the Stripe API for\nprocessing payments.\n\nChoose an SDK that works best for you and combine it with a reader that works\nbest for you. This documentation provides all the information you need to design\nyour in-person payments solution, order readers and accessories, integrate, and\ndeploy.\n\n## Scope of integration\n\nThe full scope of an integration consists of four major steps.\n\n- Use the [sample integration](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/quickstart) to\nget up and running with an integration quickly.\n- [Design your\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/designing-integration) to create\nin-person payments.\n- [Integrate the\nSDK](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/setup-integration) in your\napplication. Use the simulated reader to emulate reader behavior for all the\nTerminal flows while building your initial integration.\n- [Order](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/fleet/order-and-return-readers) a\nphysical reader and test card.\n\nFrom there, explore the docs to see all you can do with your Terminal\nintegration. We recommend [testing your\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/references/testing) and reviewing\nthe [checklist](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/references/checklist) before\ngoing live.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Design an\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/designing-integration)\n- [Sample integration](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/quickstart)\n- [Supported card\nbrands](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/collect-card-payment/supported-card-brands)\n\n## Links\n\n- [no-code POS solutions](https://stripe.partners/?f_category=point-of-sale)\n- [Stripe Terminal](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal)\n-\n[iPhone](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/setup-reader/tap-to-pay?platform=ios)\n-\n[Android](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/setup-reader/tap-to-pay?platform=android)\n- [pre-certified\nreaders](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/setup-reader)\n- [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)\n- [Billing](https://docs.stripe.com/billing)\n- [supported card\nbrands](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/collect-card-payment/supported-card-brands)\n- [request an invite](https://stripe.com/terminal#request-invite)\n- [server-driven\nintegration](https://support.stripe.com/questions/terminal-server-driven-integration)\n- [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/connect-reader)\n- [pre-certified\nreaders](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/fleet/order-and-return-readers)\n- [monitor your fleet of\nreaders](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/fleet/locations-and-zones)\n- [sample integration](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/quickstart)\n- [Design your\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/designing-integration)\n- [Integrate the\nSDK](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/setup-integration)\n- [testing your\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/references/testing)\n- [checklist](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/references/checklist)",
