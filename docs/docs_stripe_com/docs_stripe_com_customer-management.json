If\nyou’re using the customer portal with Stripe Connect, make sure you configure\nthe customer portal for the platform instead of a connected account.Ephemeral\nsessionsPortal sessions are temporary. New portal sessions expire after a 5\nminute period. If a customer uses it within that time period, the session\nexpires within 1 hour of the most recent activity.\n### Customer portal limitations\n\nThe customer portal has the following limitations:\n\n- If subscriptions use any of the following, customers can only *cancel* them in\nthe portal (they can’t *update* such subscriptions):\n\n- [Multiple\nproducts](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/multiple-products)\n- [Usage-based\nbilling](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models#usage-based-pricing)\n- Sending invoices for collection. Read more about the `collection_method`\n[parameter](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-collection_method).\nIf you use the Dashboard to create the subscription, you make this selection in\nthe **Payment method** section.\n- Unsupported payment methods\n- Customers can’t update or cancel subscriptions that currently have an update\nscheduled with a [subscription\nschedule](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/subscription-schedules).\n- Customers can only modify subscriptions if the new price has the same [tax\nbehavior](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/create#create_price-tax_behavior)\nas the initial price. Additionally, no modifications are allowed if the tax\nbehavior is `unspecified`, even if the tax behavior of the new price is\n`unspecified`. Learn more about the `tax_behavior` parameter and how it [relates\nto\nsubscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/taxes/collect-taxes?tax-calculation=stripe-tax#product-and-price-setup).\n- The portal displays the payment method section if the session allows for\npayment method management, even if the portal doesn’t support the customer’s\ndefault payment method.\n- Customers can’t define multiple [Prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices)\nwith the same `product` and `recurring.interval` values. For example, to offer a\nmagazine for 4.00 USD per month regular price and 3.00 USD per month for\nstudents, create a separate student magazine\n[Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/product) version.\n- Customer modifications to a `trialing` subscription will end the free trial\nand create an invoice for immediate payment.\n- When you [allow customers to switch\nplans](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management/configure-portal#configure-subscription-management),\nyou can specify a maximum of 10 products for them to choose from.\n- Displaying the portal inside an iframe isn’t supported.\n\n## Supported payment methods\n\n[Payment\nmethod](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object#payment_method_object-type)DescriptionCurrenciesBusiness\nlocationLimitationsACH Direct Debit (`us_bank_account`)Stripe users can receive\nbank transfers directly from customers.USDUSNoneAmazon Pay (`amazon_pay`)Amazon\nPay is a wallet payment method that lets your customers check out the same way\nas on Amazon.com.USDUSNoneAU BECS Debit (`au_becs_debit`)Bulk Electronic\nClearing System (BECS) Direct Debit payments from customers with an Australian\nbank account.AUDAUSNoneBoleto (`boleto`)Boleto is a popular payment method in\nBrazil where customers pay by using a Boleto voucher with a generated\nnumber.BRLBRYou must have a Brazilian Stripe account to accept Boleto from your\ncustomers.Cards (`card`)Cards, icluding Apple Pay and Google Pay, are one of the\nmost popular ways to pay online, with broad global reach.
