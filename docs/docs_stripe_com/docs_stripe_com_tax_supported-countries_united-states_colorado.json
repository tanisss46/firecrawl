Home rule cities are\ncities that administer and collect their own sales tax.\n\nFor remote (out-of-state) businesses, Stripe calculates tax for all local\njurisdictions that are state administered and the home rule cities that enacted\na state-wide economic nexus threshold. This means that Stripe won’t calculate\ntax for the few home rule cities that haven’t adopted economic nexus.\n\n## Report and file your taxes\n\nStripe provides reports of your completed tax transactions.
