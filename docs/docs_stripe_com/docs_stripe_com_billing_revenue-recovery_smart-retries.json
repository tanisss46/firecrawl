  "content": "# Automate payment retries\n\n## Automatically retry failed payments and reduce involuntary churn.\n\nAlthough payments can fail for a number of reasons, many of them are\nrecoverable. You can automatically retry failed payments with Stripe, without\nwriting code.\n\nConfigure the settings in the **Retries** tab of the [Revenue\nrecovery](https://dashboard.stripe.com/revenue_recovery/retries) Dashboard.\n\nStripe doesn’t retry payments for:\n\n- Failures where the issuer provided a non-retryable [decline\ncode](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/revenue-recovery/smart-retries#non-retryable-decline-codes).\n- Unavailable payment methods\n- Detached connected accounts (Connect only)\n\nStripe recommends using Smart Retries, but you can also create a custom retry\nschedule.\n\n## Payment method ordering\n\nStripe uses the first payment instrument from this ordered list in retries:\n\n-\n[subscription.default_payment_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-default_payment_method)\n-\n[subscription.default_source](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-default_source)\n-\n[customer.invoice_settings.default_payment_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-invoice_settings-default_payment_method)\n-\n[customer.default_source](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-default_source)\n\nWhen you update payment methods after a failed payment attempt, update the field\nwhere the previous payment failed. For example, if a subscription has a\n`default_payment_method`, but you only update\n`customer.invoice_settings.default_payment_method`, Stripe continues to retry on\nthe subscription’s `default_payment_method`.\n\n## Smart Retries\n\nUsing machine learning, Smart Retries chooses the best times to retry failed\npayment attempts to increase the chance of successfully paying an invoice. The\nmachine learning system behind Smart Retries uses time-dependent, dynamic\nsignals, such as:\n\n- The number of different devices that have presented a given payment method in\nthe last *N* hours.\n- The best time to pay (payments made for debit cards in certain countries might\nbe slightly more successful at 12:01 AM in local time zones).\n\nBased on a combination of these factors, Stripe intelligently assesses when to\nretry payments. We continuously learn from new purchaser behaviors and\ntransactions, which provide for a more targeted approach over traditional\nrules-based payment retry logic.\n\nSmart Retries reattempts the charge according to your specifications for the\nnumber of retries and the maximum duration. You can also use\n[automations](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/automations) to create different\nretry policies for different customer segments.\n\nYou can override this behavior by [disabling Smart\nRetries](https://dashboard.stripe.com/revenue_recovery/retries) and defining\nyour own custom retry rules. When you enable dunning, the\n[next_payment_attempt](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-next_payment_attempt)\nattribute indicates when the next collection attempt will be.\n\n## ACH Debit retries\n\n[Enable ACH Debit\nretries](https://dashboard.stripe.com/revenue_recovery/retries) to have Stripe\nautomatically retry failed ACH Debit payments caused by insufficient funds.\nStripe retries the failed ACH Debit a maximum of two times over a 14 day period.\n\nYou can turn on retries for recurring subscription invoices, one-off invoices,\nor both types of invoice.\n\nBefore retrying, make sure you’ve [obtained\nauthorization](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ach-direct-debit#mandates) from\nyour customer to retry a debit on their bank account.\n\n## Webhook events\n\nFor both Smart Retries and custom retry schedules, Stripe reattempts the charge\naccording to your specified schedule. Use the `invoice.payment_failed`\n[webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) to receive subscription payment\nfailure events and retry attempt updates.\n\nThe\n[attempt_count](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-next_payment_attempt)\nattribute on the `invoice.payment_failed` webhook indicates how many attempts\nhave been made so far. If a failure returns a non-retryable return code, we\ncan’t retry invoice payment without a new payment method. Retries continue to be\nscheduled, and\n[attempt_count](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-next_payment_attempt)\ncontinues to increment, but retries only execute after detecting a new payment\nmethod. Unexecuted retries don’t create a new\n[Charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges).\n\nThe\n[next_payment_attempt](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-next_payment_attempt)\nattribute on the invoice indicates the date when Stripe will attempt the next\ncollection. For [automations](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/automations)\nusers,\n[next_payment_attempt](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-next_payment_attempt)\nis no longer set in `invoice.payment_failed` webhooks but is set in\n`invoice.updated` webhooks.\n\n### Non-retryable decline codes\n\nIf the card issuer returns the payment with a subset of [decline\ncodes](https://docs.stripe.com/declines/codes) considered as non-retryable, then\nStripe can’t automatically retry the payment. These codes are one of the\nfollowing:\n\n- `incorrect_number`\n- `lost_card`\n- `pickup_card`\n- `stolen_card`\n- `revocation_of_authorization`\n- `revocation_of_all_authorizations`\n- `authentication_required`\n- `highest_risk_level`\n\nFor these failures, the scheduled retries continue but the payment only executes\nif you obtain a new payment method.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Revenue recovery](https://dashboard.stripe.com/revenue_recovery/retries)\n- [decline\ncode](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/revenue-recovery/smart-retries#non-retryable-decline-codes)\n-\n[subscription.default_payment_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-default_payment_method)\n-\n[subscription.default_source](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-default_source)\n-\n[customer.invoice_settings.default_payment_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-invoice_settings-default_payment_method)\n-\n[customer.default_source](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-default_source)\n- [automations](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/automations)\n-\n[next_payment_attempt](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-next_payment_attempt)\n- [obtained\nauthorization](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ach-direct-debit#mandates)\n- [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks)\n- [Charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges)\n- [decline codes](https://docs.stripe.com/declines/codes)",
