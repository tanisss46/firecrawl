The\nmandate includes the customer’s sort code, account number, name, email, and full\naddress. Stripe can generate this mandate for businesses to present to their\ncustomers.\n\nBACS Direct Debit transactions have a limit of 100,000 GBP each. New users have\nan additional weekly limit of 10,000 GBP, which quickly increases as you process\nmore BACS Direct Debit payments. If you need higher limits, [contact\nsupport](https://support.stripe.com/?contact=true).\n\nBacs Direct Debit is a [reusable, delayed notification payment\nmethod](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#payment-notification).\nThis means it takes 4 business days to confirm the success or failure of a\npayment when a mandate is already in place, but when you must collect a new\nmandate, it can take 7 business days.\n\nPayment method propertiesBusiness locationsProduct support- **Customer\nlocations**\n\nUK\n- **Presentment currency**\n\nGBP\n- **Payment confirmation**\n\nBusiness-initiated\n- **Payment method family**\n\nBank debit\n- **Recurring payments**\n\nYes\n- **Payout timing**\n\nStandard payout timing applies\n- **Connect support**\n\nYes\n- **Dispute support**\n\n[Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/bacs-debit#disputed-payments)\n- **Manual capture support**\n\nNo\n- **Refunds / Partial refunds**\n\n[Yes / Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/bacs-debit#refunds)\n\n## Verification Requirements\n\nUsing Bacs Direct Debit requires you to complete additional [identity\nverification](https://support.stripe.com/questions/common-questions-about-stripe-identity#how-verification-works)\nsteps. We prompt you to complete these steps after you request access from the\n[Payment methods\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods). If you require\nfurther assistance, [contact support](https://support.stripe.com/contact).\n\n## Get started\n\nYou don’t have to integrate Bacs Direct Debit and other payment methods\nindividually. If you use our front-end products, Stripe automatically determines\nthe most relevant payment methods to display. Go to the [Stripe\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and enable\nBacs Direct Debit. To get started with one of our hosted UIs, follow a\nquickstart:\n\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart): Our prebuilt, hosted\ncheckout page.\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart): Our drop-in UI\ncomponents.\n\n### Other payment products\n\nThe following Stripe products also let you add Bacs Direct Debit from the\nDashboard:\n\n- [Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/no-code-guide)\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n- [Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview)\n\nIf you prefer to manually list payment methods or want to save Bacs Direct Debit\ndetails for future payments, see the following guides:\n\n- [Manually configure Bacs Direct Debit as a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bacs-debit/accept-a-payment)\n- [Save Bacs Direct Debit details for future\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bacs-debit/save-bank-details)\n\n## Debit notifications\n\nBacs Direct Debit requires that customers are notified of the following:\n\n- When payment details are initially collected and confirmed\n- Each time a debit will be made on their account\n\nBy default, Stripe automatically sends emails to the customer for the above\ncases. You can [customize the colors and\nlogo](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/branding) for these emails to fit the\ndesign and branding of your business.\n\nIf you require sending your own customer email notifications, [follow these\nsteps](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bacs-debit/email-customization) to\ncustomize your Business Display Name and contact us for approval of your email\ntemplates.\n\n## Disputes\n\nBacs Direct Debit provides a [dispute\nprocess](https://stripe.com/legal/bacs-direct-debit-guarantee) for customers to\ndispute payments.\n\n#### Caution\n\n[Customers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers) can dispute a payment through\ntheir bank for an unlimited period of time.\n\nWhen a dispute is created, Stripe sends a `charge.dispute.created`\n[webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) event and deducts the dispute amount\nfrom your Stripe balance.\n\nUnlike [credit card disputes](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes), Bacs Direct\nDebit disputes are final and can’t be appealed. If a customer successfully\ndisputes a payment, you must contact them if you want to resolve the situation.\nIf you’re able to come to an arrangement and your customer is willing to return\nthe funds to you, they must make a new payment.\n\n## Mandates\n\nAs part of the payment process, businesses must collect a mandate which gives\nthem authorization to debit an account. For Bacs, this mandate is called a\nDirect Debit Instruction, or DDI. You can find information on how to collect a\nmandate with Stripe [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout) on the\n[Accept a payment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bacs-debit/accept-a-payment)\npage.\n\nCustomers can request the cancellation of a mandate at any time. To cancel a\nmandate, a customer must either reach out to the party they established the\nmandate with, or to their bank. Canceling a mandate invalidates any future debit\nrequests that you issue using this mandate. If you want to accept additional\npayments from your customer, you need to establish a new mandate with them.\n\n### Mandate cancellation\n\nMandate cancellation ensures that no further debit requests can be made using\nthe canceled mandate. When a customer requests cancellation through the party\nthey established it with or directly through their bank, it renders any future\ndebit requests associated with that mandate invalid. You can also cancel active\nmandates by detaching the payment methods and sources associated with them. You\ncan detach a payment method by deleting it from the Customer view in the Stripe\nDashboard or by using the\n[API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/detach).\n\n### Mandate events\n\nThe mandate can change at any time after you’ve collected it. This might be the\nresult of the customer instructing their bank to amend the mandate or because of\na change in the bank itself (for example, the customer changes to a different\none). Stripe sends the following events when the mandate changes:\n\nEvent nameDescription Can accept payments?`mandate.updated`Occurs whenever a\nmandate is rejected, canceled, or reactivated by the Bacs network. Check\n[mandate.status](https://docs.stripe.com/api/mandates/object#mandate_object-status)\nto determine if the mandate can continue to be used.Yes, if the new status is\n`active``payment_method.automatically_updated`Occurs when a customer’s bank\naccount details change.Yes\nThese events are available in the\n[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/events), but you can set up a\n[webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) to handle these programatically.\n\n## Refunds\n\nRefunds for payments made with Bacs Direct Debit must be submitted within 180\ndays from the date of the original payment. Refunds require additional time to\nprocess (typically 3-4 business days). If you accidentally debit your customer,\nplease contact them immediately to avoid a payment dispute.\n\n#### Warning\n\nRefunds aren’t part of the Bacs Direct Debit scheme and are provided outside of\nBacs Direct Debit by Stripe. Since Bacs Direct Debit has an indefinite indemnity\nperiod, if a customer creates a [dispute](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes) *any\ntime after* a refund has been issued, you can lose both the disputed amount and\nthe amount you refunded separately.\n\nYou can issue full or partial refunds for Direct Debit payments by using the API\nto [create a refund](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_refund) with the\n[PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object) object.\n\nRefunds are processed only after the payment process is complete. If you create\na full or partial refund on a payment that hasn’t completed yet, the refund\nprocess starts when the [Charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object)\nobject’s status transitions to `succeeded`. If the\n[Charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object) object’s status transitions\nto `failed`, the full or partial refund is marked as canceled because the money\nwas never debited from the customer’s bank account.\n\n## Timing\n\nIt takes 4 business days to confirm the success or failure of a Bacs Direct\nDebit payment when a mandate is already in place and 7 business days when a new\nmandate must be collected. Payments made after 20:00 UTC are submitted the\nfollowing business day.\n\nIn some cases, the bank might notify us of a payment failure after the payment\nhas been marked as successful in your Stripe account. In this case the payment\nfailure is identified as a dispute with the appropriate reason code.\n\nThis table shows the Bacs timeline in business days from the time (T) that a\npayment is made when a new mandate must be collected:\n\nT+0Mandate submittedT+3Mandate is active and the payment is submittedT+5Funds\nleave the customer’s bank accountT+7Funds are available in Stripe\n## Checkout\n\n[Checkout](https://stripe.com/checkout) creates a secure, Stripe-hosted payment\npage that lets you collect payments quickly. You can use Checkout to collect\nBacs Direct Debit payments, or collect payment details that you can use to\ninitiate payments at a later date.\n\n### Request the bacs_debit_payments capability\n\nPlatforms in the UK don’t need to request the `bacs_debit_payments` capability\nfor their UK Connect accounts when performing [destination\ncharges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges). Platforms outside\nthe UK might still need to process Bacs Direct Debit payments for their UK\nConnect accounts, and they must have the `bacs_debit_payments` capability\nenabled.\n\nIn both scenarios, you must [request the bacs_debit_payments\ncapability](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities) if you want to\nuse the\n[on_behalf_of](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-on_behalf_of)\nparameter.\n\nRequesting the `bacs_debit_payments` capability with\n`settings.bacs_debit_payments.display_name` automatically enables custom\nbranding. This allows you to collect mandates using the connected account’s\nchosen display name as the statement descriptor.\n\nEach account that uses custom branding incurs a 50 GBP monthly fee.\n\nIf you don’t want to use custom branding, you can do either of the following:\n\n- Request the capability without specifying\n`settings.bacs_debit_payments.display_name`\n- Set the default value of `settings.bacs_debit_payments.display_name = Stripe`\nbefore requesting the capability\n\n## Custom Branding\n\nUpgrade to Custom Branding if you want to customize your customer’s bank\nstatements, Stripe Checkout, and customer emails for direct debits to show your\nbusiness name.\n\nYou can enable Custom Branding for your account in your [Bacs Direct Debit\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods).\n\nFor your Express or Custom accounts, you can enable Custom Branding by selecting\n`settings.bacs_debit_payments.display_name` in the\n[API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-settings-bacs_debit_payments-display_name).\n\nYou can do this during account creation or when updating the account after\nsetup.\n\nIf you request the `bacs_debit_payments` capability without specifying\n`settings.bacs_debit_payments.display_name`, the account defaults to Stripe\nbranding.\n\nCustom Branding is charged at 50 GBP per active month. Your business name is\nshown for new mandates created 5 business days after your request. To expedite\nCustom Branding or apply it to multiple connected accounts for a single fee,\n[contact us](https://support.stripe.com/contact).\n\nIf you don’t use your custom branding for a long period of time, your account\nautomatically reverts to the default Stripe branding. Alternatively, if you have\nno active Bacs Debit mandates you can revert to the default Stripe branding in\nyour [Bacs Direct Debit\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods).\n\n## Smart retries Private preview\n\n## Request early access to Bacs Debit smart retries\n\nJoin our private preview.\n\nCollect EmailSign upRead our [privacy policy](https://stripe.com/privacy).\n\n## Links\n\n- [contact support](https://support.stripe.com/?contact=true)\n- [reusable, delayed notification payment\nmethod](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#payment-notification)\n-\n[Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/bacs-debit#disputed-payments)\n- [Yes /\nYes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/bacs-debit#refunds)\n- [identity\nverification](https://support.stripe.com/questions/common-questions-about-stripe-identity#how-verification-works)\n- [Payment methods\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods)\n- [contact support](https://support.stripe.com/contact)\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart)\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart)\n- [Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/no-code-guide)\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n- [Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview)\n- [Manually configure Bacs Direct Debit as a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bacs-debit/accept-a-payment)\n- [Save Bacs Direct Debit details for future\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bacs-debit/save-bank-details)\n- [customize the colors and logo](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/branding)\n- [follow these\nsteps](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bacs-debit/email-customization)\n- [dispute process](https://stripe.com/legal/bacs-direct-debit-guarantee)\n- [Customers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers)\n- [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks)\n- [credit card disputes](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes)\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout)\n- [API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/detach)\n-\n[mandate.status](https://docs.stripe.com/api/mandates/object#mandate_object-status)\n- [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/events)\n- [create a refund](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_refund)\n- [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object)\n- [Charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object)\n- [Checkout](https://stripe.com/checkout)\n- [destination charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges)\n- [request the bacs_debit_payments\ncapability](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities)\n-\n[on_behalf_of](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-on_behalf_of)\n-\n[API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-settings-bacs_debit_payments-display_name)\n- [privacy policy](https://stripe.com/privacy)",
