Go to [Checkout\nSettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/checkout) to configure the\ninformation you want to display, including:\n\n- Details about your return and refund policies\n- Your support phone number, email, and website\n- Links to your terms of service and privacy policy\n\nPresenting this information can increase buyer confidence and minimize cart\nabandonment.\n\n### Configure support and legal policies\n\nFrom [Checkout Settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/checkout), add\nsupport contact information to your sessions by enabling **Contact\ninformation**. Similarly, add links to your **Terms of service** and **Privacy\npolicy** to your sessions by enabling **Legal policies**. If you require\ncustomers to implicitly consent to your legal policies when they complete their\ncheckout, select the **Display agreement to legal terms** checkbox.\n\nYou must add your support contact information and legal policy links in your\n[Public Detail Settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public).\n\nThe following previews show how Checkout displays a dialog with the support\ncontact information, links to the store legal policies, and information about\nthe payment terms.\n\n![A checkout page with contact\ninformation.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/contact-modal.2b81bc2e74657f7c94a45a743439c81f.png)\n\nPreview of contact information on Checkout.\n\n![A checkout page with legal\npolicies.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/legal-modal.9351cb51408c2a9f5c0ae23aab03e138.png)\n\nPreview of legal policies on Checkout.\n\n### Configure return and refund policies\n\nDisplay your return, refund, or exchange policies, by enabling **Return and\nRefund policies**. Although businesses that sell physical goods use return\npolicies, businesses that sell digital goods or customized physical goods\ntypically use refund policies. Because they’re not mutually exclusive, you can\nselect both options if your business sells both categories of goods. You can\nedit your return and refund details, including:\n\n- Whether you accept returns, refunds, or exchanges\n- Whether returns, refunds, or exchanges are free or if they’re subject to a fee\n- How many days after a purchase you’ll accept returns, refunds, or exchanges\n- How customers can return items shipped to them\n- Whether you accept in-store returns\n- A link to the full return and refund policy\n- A custom message\n\nIf you accept free returns, refunds, or exchanges, Checkout highlights the\npolicy for customers.\n\nThe following previews show how Checkout displays a return policy. In this\nexample, it’s for purchases that can be returned by shipping them or in-store\nfor a full refund (or exchange) for up to 60 days. You can display similar\ninformation for refunds.\n\n![Preview of return policies on\nCheckout](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/return-policy-modal.0c7a9ff71b8bc2c155842532801e06a8.png)\n\nPreview of return policies on Checkout.\n\n![Preview of a policy highlight on\nCheckout](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/policy-highlight.334828420693a33d376977a2c0fe5851.png)\n\nPreview of a policy highlight on Checkout.\n\n## Other customization options\n\n- **Custom domains**\n\nCheckout, Payment Links, and customer portal pages use stripe.com as the default\ndomain. You can optionally set up your own [custom\ndomain](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/custom-domains) for those\nproducts.\n- **Custom email domain**\n\nBy default, when Stripe sends invoices, receipts, and failed payment\nnotifications to your customers, it sends them from the stripe.com domain. Set\nup your own [custom\ndomain](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/email-domain) to change\nthis.\n- **Payments, debits, and bank transfer emails**\n\nYou can decide which emails your customers receive about payments, debits, and\nbank transfers in your [Customer emails\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/emails). You can also choose the\ndefault language to use for emails when you don’t know a customer’s preference.\n- **Billing (subscription and invoicing) emails**\n\nYou can turn on customer emails for\n[Billing](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/revenue-recovery/customer-emails) and\n[Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/send-email) in the Dashboard or\nthrough the API.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Branding settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/branding)\n-\n[Accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-settings-branding)\n- [Checkout Settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/checkout)\n- [Public Detail Settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public)\n- [custom domain](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/custom-domains)\n- [custom domain](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/email-domain)\n- [Customer emails settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/emails)\n- [Billing](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/revenue-recovery/customer-emails)\n- [Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/send-email)",
