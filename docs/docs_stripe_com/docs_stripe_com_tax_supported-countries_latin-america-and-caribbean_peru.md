# Collect tax in Peru

## Learn how to use Stripe Tax to calculate, collect, and report tax in Peru.

In Peru, Stripe only supports collecting VAT for digital services. In Stripe,
these are referred to as “digital products.” To collect this tax on Stripe, you
must be a remote seller without a physical presence in the country.

## When to register for tax collection

See [Thresholds](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/thresholds) to get insights
about your potential tax registration obligations in Peru. Stripe also notifies
you with email and Dashboard alerts when you need to register to collect tax.
Learn more about how the [monitoring tool
works](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/monitoring).

Remote sellers providing digital goods or electronically supplied services
(digital products) to consumers in Peru must register for VAT from the first
sale. Sales to business customers in Peru don’t trigger any tax registration
obligations as remote sellers aren’t required to collect tax on those sales.

- **Threshold**: 1 transaction
- **Included transactions**: Business-to-consumer (B2C) sales of digital goods
or electronically supplied services (digital products)

## How we calculate taxes

We only support calculations for [digital
products](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes?type=digital) (non-physical
items or services that are delivered, given, or rendered electronically) in
Peru. Stripe doesn’t calculate tax for products that don’t use a digital product
tax code.

View the list of supported [digital product tax
codes](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes?type=digital). To calculate taxes
in Peru, make sure that you [assign a tax
code](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/products-prices-tax-codes-tax-behavior#tax-code-on-product)
to each of your products.

## Report and file your taxes

Stripe provides reports of your completed tax transactions. Go to
[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations) to access these
reports. Learn more about [the different types of
reports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports).

You’re responsible for filing and remitting your taxes to Peru. Stripe doesn’t
file taxes on your behalf.
