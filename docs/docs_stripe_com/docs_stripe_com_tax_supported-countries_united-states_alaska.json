However local jurisdictions within Alaska\nmay impose a sales and use tax. Each jurisdiction can define what it means to be\ndoing business in that location and whether sales tax applies. Many local\njurisdictions in Alaska have chosen to adopt the [Alaska Remote Seller Sales Tax\nCommission (ARSSTC)](https://arsstc.org/business-sellers/) uniform tax code.\nThis includes using state-wide thresholds to determine whether a business needs\nto pay tax there.\n\nRemote sellers must register to collect and remit tax in Alaska when, in the\nprevious or current calendar year, they meet or exceed a sales threshold of\n100,000 USD.\n\nThe threshold includes gross sales, including marketplace sales.\n\nAlaska’s economic nexus law differs from other economic nexus laws. The state\npassed the Alaska Remote Seller Sales Tax Code on January 6, 2020. However,\nlocal jurisdictions decide whether to adopt the code. After a local jurisdiction\nadopts the code, businesses have 30 days to begin collecting sales tax from\nAlaska buyers in that jurisdiction.\n\nSee [Thresholds](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/thresholds) to get insights\nabout your sales into the state and potential tax registration obligations in\nAlaska. Stripe also notifies you with email and Dashboard alerts when you need\nto register to collect tax.
