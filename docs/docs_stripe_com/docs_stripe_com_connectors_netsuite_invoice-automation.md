# Stripe Billing and Invoicing automation

## Use the connector to sync your Stripe invoices into NetSuite.

The Stripe Connector for NetSuite automatically syncs the invoices that you
create from Stripe Billing
[subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview) or
[Stripe Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/overview) into NetSuite.
The sync includes details such as [credit
notes](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/dashboard/credit-notes),
[discounts](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/coupons),
[uncollectible
invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/examples/contra#uncollectible),
[taxes](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/taxes/collect-taxes), and
[prorations](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/prorations).

You can complete your accounting workflows entirely in Stripe using the
automated process, which means you donâ€™t need to manually reconcile activity.
Stripe transaction data syncs at the transaction level in NetSuite, allowing you
to use advanced reporting on Stripe data in NetSuite.

## How it works

When you use the connector with [Stripe
Billing](https://docs.stripe.com/billing) or [Stripe
Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/overview), the invoice automation
process is as follows:

- A customer provides their payment information through a Stripe payment flow on
your website. This action creates a Stripe `Customer` object.
- Stripe creates an invoice at the beginning of each billing period, which
prompts the connector to create an invoice in NetSuite. The connector also
creates a new customer or links to an existing NetSuite customer.
- If you enabled NetSuite revenue recognition, the connector splits revenue over
the correct period on the line item level.
- When a customer successfully pays the Stripe invoice, the connector creates a
NetSuite `Customer Payment` and applies it to the corresponding invoice in
NetSuite. If payment fails, resulting in a canceled subscription, the connector
can automatically close the NetSuite invoice with a credit memo, or whatever
action you configure for failed payments.
- The connector automatically syncs refunds and disputes from Stripe to
NetSuite, and creates credit memos and customer refunds.
- The connector [automatically
reconciles](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/netsuite/deposit-automation)
Stripe payments against a bank deposit in NetSuite. This includes calculating
and recording any processing fees or currency conversion fees.
