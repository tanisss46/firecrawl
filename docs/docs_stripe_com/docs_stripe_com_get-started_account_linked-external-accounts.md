# Linked external accounts

## Manage your linked external accounts.

When you first set up your Stripe account, we ask you to connect your bank
account so that you can receive payouts. If you want Stripe to access additional
account information, you can link a financial account. This allows Stripe to
better serve your business needs and provide necessary information for credit
and risk reviews. Linking your account also reduces the need for us to collect
additional financial information in the future, potentially reducing the
frequency of credit and other risk reviews.

Stripe might use your financial account information to:

- Link your financial account for [payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts).
- Evaluate eligibility for loans or other Stripe products.
- Enable additional Stripe product features.
- Re-evaluate reserve balances during risk reviews.

#### Note

We handle data from your linked financial accounts according to the [Stripe
Services Agreement](https://stripe.com/legal), [Stripe Privacy
Policy](https://stripe.com/privacy) and the [partner
terms](https://connect.finicity.com/assets/html/connect-eula.html). Stripe’s
partner can only obtain financial account information as authorized by you.
Stripe doesn’t sell your data to unaffiliated third parties.

## Financial account data

With your consent, we can access your linked account to retrieve the following
information:

- **Account details**: Account type, account number, current balance, and
historical balances.
- **Contact information**: Your name, email address, phone number, physical
address, and other details held by your financial account.
- **Account transactions**: Each transaction’s amount, date, and description.

Here are a few Stripe products and services that rely on your financial account
information:

- **Payouts**: Stripe uses your financial account information (specifically, the
account number and routing number) to verify your account to enable
[payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts). You can link this account during
onboarding, or at a later time by using your **Linked external accounts**
settings in the Stripe Dashboard.
- **Risk**: We analyze your financial account information to ascertain if a
[reserve](https://support.stripe.com/topics/reserves) is required, and decide
the appropriate amount for that reserve. Linking your financial account allows
Stripe to continually reassess your risk profile, which could help reduce or
eliminate the need for a reserve.
- **Corporate Card**: We use your financial account information during the
underwriting process to determine your [Corporate
Card](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing) credit limit. This limit can vary based
on changes in your financial account information. If you unlink a financial
account, it might affect your ability to use your Corporate Card.
- **Capital**: [Stripe Capital](https://docs.stripe.com/capital/eligibility)
uses your financial account information to evaluate your loan eligibility and
the details of your loan offer.

The type of data available to Stripe might vary based on your financial account
or our technology partner. Go to your [Linked external accounts
settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/linked-accounts) to see the
accounts you’ve linked to Stripe and what information you’ve shared with
different Stripe products.

#### Note

We have organizational, technical, and administrative measures in place to
protect your financial account data from unauthorized access, destruction, loss,
alteration, or misuse within our organization. Should you believe that your
interaction with us is no longer secure (for instance, if you feel that the
security of your account has been compromised), please [contact
us](https://support.stripe.com/contact) immediately.

## Link a financial account

If your Dashboard prompts you to **Link your bank account to Stripe**, follow
these steps:

- Click **Link bank account** in the **Link your bank account to Stripe** banner
in your Dashboard.
- Click **Link your account**.
- Choose your bank account provider and enter your bank account login details.
- Select all accounts or specific accounts (such as checking or savings
accounts) and click **Link accounts**.
- To add multiple bank accounts, click **Link another account**. If not, click
**Done**.
- You can verify the successful linking of bank accounts on the [Linked external
accounts settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/linked-accounts).

You can also link your financial accounts directly from the Dashboard by
following these steps:

- Visit the [Linked external accounts
settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/linked-accounts) in your
Dashboard.
- Click **+ Add account**.
- Choose your bank account provider and enter your bank account login
credentials.
- Select all or specific accounts (such as checking or savings accounts) and
click **Link Accounts**.

**Done**.
- Check the **Linked external accounts** page to verify that the bank accounts
were successfully linked.

## Data management

You can control which Stripe products use your account data. By default, when
you link your financial accounts, this account data is shared with Stripe
products as shown on the [Link external accounts
settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/linked-accounts). From this
page, you can control which Stripe products receive and use your data. You also
have the option to opt out of sharing your financial account data, which might
affect your ability to use certain products and features.

### Data retrieval frequency

How often Stripe accesses your data depends on the products you use. For
instance, when assessing a risk reserve on your account, we might access your
financial account information as often as daily because understanding your
business’s risk profile requires this information.

For the Corporate Card, we might monitor your financial account data daily to
assess if a change in your credit limit is necessary. For other products, such
as Capital, we might get your financial account data once a week or once a
month.

### Data retention duration

We retain your financial account information for as long as we’re providing
services to you. We also keep this information to comply with our tax,
accounting, and financial reporting obligations, to meet our contractual
commitments to our financial partners, and where data retention is mandated by
the payment methods we support. Even if you close your Stripe account, we might
still need to retain your financial account information for a certain period
following any limitation periods and record-keeping requirements imposed by
applicable law.

### Data sharing

We use your financial account information as outlined in the [Stripe Privacy
Policy](https://stripe.com/privacy). We only use your data for internal
purposes, such as offering additional products, services, or features. Stripe
doesn’t sell or rent your financial account information to marketers or
unaffiliated third parties. We might share your data with trusted entities (like
service providers, business partners, third parties authorized by you to access
this information, and for compliance purposes) as stated in our privacy policy.

### Revoke consent

At any time, you can revoke your consent by visiting your [Link external
accounts settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/linked-accounts) and
clicking **Remove account** on any account you want to unlink. After you revoke
your consent, we stop obtaining your account data. You can learn more about what
happens when you [disconnect an
account](https://support.stripe.com/questions/what-happens-when-i-disconnect-a-linked-financial-account).

Choosing not to link a financial account, or unlinking one, might make you
ineligible to access or receive offers for additional products or services,
enhancements to current products, or services. In some cases, we might request
alternative information, such as financial statements.

## Trusted entity identification

When you link a financial account with Stripe, we become the primary recipient
of your account data. Depending on the purpose for linking your account, we may
also share this data with certain financial institutions or service providers
involved in offering Stripe Capital and other financial services. For example,
if you obtain a loan through Stripe Capital, we might share your account data
with service providers that help manage your loan. Stripe only shares your data
as set out in the [Stripe Privacy Policy](https://stripe.com/privacy).

## Stripe’s technology partners

We work with third-party data aggregators, namely Finicity and MX, to obtain the
data you’ve agreed to share with us and other reliable entities. When you enter
your login credentials in the credential dialog, you might be sharing this
information with Finicity and MX, or otherwise allowing these third-party data
aggregators access to your accounts. Finicity and MX use your login details or
your authorization to continually access your account data and provide this data
to Stripe and other trusted entities authorized by you to receive it.
