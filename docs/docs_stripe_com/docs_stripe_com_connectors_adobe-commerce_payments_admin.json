However, if you\nchose to *Authorize and Capture*, proceed to the next step.\n- From the left sidebar, click **Invoices**, then click on the\n[invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices) to refund it.\n- At the top right-hand corner, click **Credit Memo**.\n- Adjust the amount (if necessary) and click **Refund** at the bottom of the\npage to perform a live refund. By clicking **Refund Offline**, you only issue\nthe refund in Adobe Commerce and not in Stripe.\n- For a partial refund, you can adjust the **Adjustment Fee**. This is the\namount you don’t want to refund. In the screenshot above, by setting the\nadjustment fee to 10 USD, we’re refunding 53.87 USD and 10 USD is kept as a fee.\nYou can ignore the **Adjustment Refund** field because we won’t refund an amount\nthat is greater than the original payment of the customer.\n\nThe amount is now fully or partially refunded in Stripe and a note appears in\nthe **Comments History** of the order.\n\n## Authorizing card payments and capturing later\n\nIn your [card\nsettings](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/adobe-commerce/payments/configuration#payments),\nyou can set **Payment Action** to only authorize card payments when placing an\norder. The bank guarantees the amount and holds it on the customer’s card for up\nto 7 days. Failure to capture the payment by this time cancels the authorization\nand releases the funds.\n\nOptionally, you can set **Expired Authorizations** to attempt to re-authorize\nthe payment in case you miss the 7-day window but it isn’t guaranteed to\nsucceed.\n\nWhen ready to capture (for example, you shipped the product), follow these\nsteps:\n\n- Go to **Sales > Orders**.\n- Find the relevant order.\n- Click **Invoice**.\n- If you need to issue a partial invoice, adjust the invoice items as shown in\nthe video below. You can reduce the item quantity but not increase it.\n- Click **Submit Invoice** to capture and finalize the payment.\n\nAfter clicking **Submit Invoice**, you can see the captured funds in the Stripe\nDashboard.\n\n## Creating orders\n\nYou can create an order and charge a customer’s card with details that you’ve\nreceived over the phone, directly from the Adobe Commerce admin panel:\n\n- Go to **Sales > Orders**.\n- At the top right hand side, click **Create New Order**.\n- Choose a customer, the store, and any products for that order.\n- Select a shipping method (if applicable) before filling in payment details.\n- When you’re ready to submit the order, select a saved payment method. Clicking\nthe **Add new** button redirects you to the customer page in Stripe, where you\ncan securely enter a new payment method.\n- Click **Submit Order**.\n\n!\n\nPayment information for admin orders\n\nIf you set **Payment Action** to authorize and capture, we charge the card\nimmediately. If you set **Payment Action** to authorize only, you must also\n[capture the\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/adobe-commerce/payments/admin#capturing-later).\n\n## Send an invoice to the customer\n\nWhen creating a new order from your Adobe Commerce admin, you have the option to\nsend an invoice link to the customer by email:\n\n!\n\nSend an invoice to the customer\n\nYou can change the due date to help keeping track of late payments in your\nStripe Dashboard.\n\nUsing this method is more secure than paying by card from the Admin Panel as you\navoid collecting sensitive payment information over the phone. By opening the\nlink in the email, the customer opens a [Hosted Invoice\nPage](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/hosted-invoice-page) which includes a\npayment form.\n\n## See also\n\n-\n[Troubleshooting](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/adobe-commerce/payments/troubleshooting)\n\n## Links\n\n- [invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n- [card\nsettings](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/adobe-commerce/payments/configuration#payments)\n- [Hosted Invoice Page](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/hosted-invoice-page)\n-\n[Troubleshooting](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/adobe-commerce/payments/troubleshooting)",
