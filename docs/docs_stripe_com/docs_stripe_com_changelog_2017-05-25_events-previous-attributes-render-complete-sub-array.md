# Events with the previous_attributes field now render the complete affected sub-arrayBreaking changes

## What’s new

Updates the `previous_attributes` property on `Event` objects to show entire
sub-arrays when those arrays have changes. Previously, those sub-arrays only
showed the specific fields that changed.

## Impact

This change provides more comprehensive information about changes in sub-arrays
within the `previous_attributes` property of `Event` objects. You can now see
the entire sub-array that was modified, rather than just the specific changed
fields, offering more context for event-driven operations.
