You don’t need a\nlocal Nigerian entity, and the partner provides a localized checkout flow.\n\nNigerian customers typically pay using local cards, bank transfers, wallets, and\nUSSD. You can accept a selection of local wallets and cards by offering your\nservices through our Nigerian merchant of record.\n\n## Payment flow\n\nAfter the customer enters their information in Stripe’s checkout page, clicking\n**Pay** redirects them to the checkout page of the merchant of record service\nprovider and their local processor. They complete the payment there.\n\n## Available payment methods\n\nYou can accept the following local payment methods:\n\n- [Naira card](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ng-card/accept-a-payment)\n- [Naira bank\ntransfer](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ng-bank-transfer/accept-a-payment)\n\n#### Nigerian VAT\n\nWhen the merchant of record services provider processes local transactions in\nNigeria, it remits buyer VAT. Accordingly, for Nigerian buyers, include VAT in\nyour presentment pricing. For more information, see the [full merchant of record\nservices\nterms](https://d37ugbyn3rpeym.cloudfront.net/docs/GSSL%20-%20Buyer%20T&Cs%20(Final).pdf).\n\nPayment method propertiesCountry availability- **Customer locations**\n\nNigeria\n- **Presentment currency**\n\nNGN\n- **Payment confirmation**\n\nCustomer-authenticated\n- **Payment method family**\n\nCountries\n- **Recurring payments**\n\nYes\n- **Payout timing**\n\nStandard payout timing applies\n- **Connect support**\n\nYes\n- **Dispute support**\n\nNo\n- **Manual capture support**\n\nYes\n- **Refunds / Partial refunds**\n\nYes / Yes\n\n## Interested in using Nigerian payment methods?\n\nTo request an invite, enter your business email address below.\n\nCollect EmailSign upRead our [privacy policy](https://stripe.com/privacy).\n## Get started\n\nYou don’t have to integrate Naira payment methods and other payment methods\nindividually. If you use our front-end products, Stripe automatically determines\nthe most relevant payment methods to display. Go to the [Stripe\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and enable\nNaira payment methods. To get started with one of our hosted UIs, follow a\nquickstart:\n\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart): Our prebuilt, hosted\ncheckout page.\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart): Our drop-in UI\ncomponents.\n\n### Other payment products\n\nThe following Stripe products also let you add Naira payment methods from the\nDashboard:\n\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n\n### Integrate through the API\n\nYou can also use the [Payment Intents\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents) to enable Naira payment\nmethods, as detailed in the table below. To test your integration’s\nredirect-handling logic, follow our guide to [simulating a payment that uses a\nredirect\nflow](https://docs.stripe.com/testing?testing-method=payment-methods#redirects).\n\n## Payment process\n\nCustomers who elect to pay with Naira payment methods are redirected to a\nlocalized checkout experience provided by the local merchant of record service\nprovider and their processor partner. After they [authorize the\ntransaction](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#customer-actions)\nand the payment is approved, funds are available in your Stripe account after 3\ndays.\n\n## Payment methods\n\nWe support the following local Naira payment methods:\n\nOne-timeRecurring[Naira\ncards](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ng-card/accept-a-payment)YesYes[Naira\nbank\ntransfer](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ng-bank-transfer/accept-a-payment)YesComing\nsoonNaira walletComing soonNo\n## Refunds\n\nPayments made with Nigerian payment methods can only be submitted for refund\nwithin 365 calendar days from the date of the original charge. After 365 days,\nit’s no longer possible to refund the charge.\n\n## Disputes\n\nWith Nigerian payment methods, you can’t challenge buyer-initiated disputes. If\nStripe is notified that the relevant payment service providers have accepted a\nrequest to return customer funds, Stripe immediately removes the funds from your\nStripe account. To resolve the situation, you must contact your customer\ndirectly.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Naira card](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ng-card/accept-a-payment)\n- [Naira bank\ntransfer](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ng-bank-transfer/accept-a-payment)\n- [full merchant of record services\nterms](https://d37ugbyn3rpeym.cloudfront.net/docs/GSSL%20-%20Buyer%20T&Cs%20(Final).pdf)\n- [privacy policy](https://stripe.com/privacy)\n- [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods)\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart)\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart)\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n- [Payment Intents API](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents)\n- [simulating a payment that uses a redirect\nflow](https://docs.stripe.com/testing?testing-method=payment-methods#redirects)\n- [authorize the\ntransaction](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#customer-actions)",
