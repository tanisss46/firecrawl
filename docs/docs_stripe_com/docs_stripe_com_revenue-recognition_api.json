You\ncan download these reports in CSV format through the\n[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/revenue-recognition) or you can\nprogrammatically access them through the API.\n\nRevenue Recognition has six supported report types:\n\n- `revenue_recognition.debit_credit_summary.1`\n- `revenue_recognition.debit_credit_by_price.1`\n- `revenue_recognition.debit_credit_by_product.1`\n- `revenue_recognition.debit_credit_by_customer.1`\n- `revenue_recognition.debit_credit_by_invoice.1`\n- `revenue_recognition.debit_credit_by_invoice_line_item.1`\n\n#### Caution\n\nBecause this feature is in beta, the data fields might change.\n\n## Download a report\n\nThe following example downloads the debits and credits by summary for May 2021.\n\nFirst, create a report run using [Create a Report\nRun](https://docs.stripe.com/api/reporting/report_run/create).\n\nTo get a report for May 2023, set `parameters[interval_start]` to 1 May 2023 and\n`parameters[interval_end]` to 1 Jun 2023.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/reporting/report_runs \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d report_type=\"revenue_recognition.debit_credit_summary.1\" \\\n -d \"parameters[interval_start]\"=1682899200 \\\n -d \"parameters[interval_end]\"=1685577600\n```\n\nNext, check whether the [Report\nRun](https://docs.stripe.com/api/reporting/report_run/object) object succeeds by\nfetching the report run object:\n\nThe report run object ID starts with `frr_`.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/reporting/report_runs/{{REPORT_RUN_OBJECT_ID}} \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\"\n```\n\nWhen the object’s `status` is `succeeded`, you can download the CSV using its\n`result.id` value, as in the following example:\n\nThe report run result ID starts with `file_`.\n\n```\ncurl https://files.stripe.com/v1/files/{{REPORT_RUN_RESULT_ID}}/contents \\\n -u sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\n```\n\n## Report Run Parameters\n\nReport TypeRequired Run ParametersOptional Run\nParametersrevenue_recognition.debit_credit_summary.1- `interval_start`\n- `interval_end`\n- `decimal_format`\nrevenue_recognition.debit_credit_by_price.1- `interval_start`\n- `interval_end`\n- `customer`\n- `decimal_format`\nrevenue_recognition.debit_credit_by_product.1- `interval_start`\n- `interval_end`\n- `customer`\n- `decimal_format`\nrevenue_recognition.debit_credit_by_customer.1- `interval_start`\n- `interval_end`\n- `decimal_format`\nrevenue_recognition.debit_credit_by_invoice.1- `interval_start`\n- `interval_end`\n- `customer`\n- `invoice`\n- `invoice_line_item`\n- `decimal_format`\nrevenue_recognition.debit_credit_by_invoice_line_item.1- `interval_start`\n- `interval_end`\n- `customer`\n- `invoice`\n- `invoice_line_item`\n- `decimal_format`\n\n## Report Run Columns\n\nBy default, reports are run with the default set of columns. You can customize\nthe selection and ordering of columns in the output by including the optional\ncolumns parameter with a [list of column\nnames](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/api#report-runs). You can find the\nsupported columns for each report type below.\n\n### Summary\n\nAPI report type: `revenue_recognition.debit_credit_summary.1`\n\nColumn NameDefaultDescriptionaccounting_periodThe accounting\nperiodopen_accounting_periodThe open accounting period; entries in open periods\nare subject to changecurrencyThree-letter [ISO code for the\ncurrency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies) of the amount.debitThe debited\naccountcreditThe credited accountamountAmount change, expressed in major units\nof the currency (for example, dollars for USD, or pesos for\nMXN).credit_gl_codeThe credited general ledger codedebit_gl_codeThe debited\ngeneral ledger code\n### By Price\n\nAPI report type: `revenue_recognition.debit_credit_by_price.1`\n\nColumn NameDefaultDescriptionaccounting_periodThe accounting\nperiodopen_accounting_periodThe open accounting period; entries in open periods\nare subject to changecurrencyThree-letter [ISO code for the\ncurrency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies) of the amount.price_idThe price\nassociated with this change.debitThe debited accountcreditThe credited\naccountamountAmount change, expressed in major units of the currency (for\nexample, dollars for USD, or pesos for MXN).credit_gl_codeThe credited general\nledger codedebit_gl_codeThe debited general ledger code\n### By Product\n\nAPI report type: `revenue_recognition.debit_credit_by_product.1`\n\nColumn NameDefaultDescriptionaccounting_periodThe accounting\nperiodopen_accounting_periodThe open accounting period; entries in open periods\nare subject to changecurrencyThree-letter [ISO code for the\ncurrency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies) of the amount.product_idThe\nproduct associated with this change.debitThe debited accountcreditThe credited\naccountamountAmount change, expressed in major units of the currency (for\nexample, dollars for USD, or pesos for MXN).credit_gl_codeThe credited general\nledger codedebit_gl_codeThe debited general ledger code\n### By Customer\n\nAPI report type: `revenue_recognition.debit_credit_by_customer.1`\n\nColumn NameDefaultDescriptionaccounting_periodThe accounting\nperiodopen_accounting_periodThe open accounting period; entries in open periods\nare subject to changecurrencyThree-letter [ISO code for the\ncurrency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies) of the amount.customer_idThe\ncustomer associated with this change.debitThe debited accountcreditThe credited\naccountamountAmount change, expressed in major units of the currency (for\nexample, dollars for USD, or pesos for MXN).credit_gl_codeThe credited general\nledger codedebit_gl_codeThe debited general ledger code\n### By Invoice\n\nAPI report type: `revenue_recognition.debit_credit_by_invoice.1`\n\nColumn NameDefaultDescriptionaccounting_periodThe accounting\nperiodopen_accounting_periodThe open accounting period; entries in open periods\nare subject to changecurrencyThree-letter [ISO code for the\ncurrency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies) of the\namount.transaction_model_idThe model in Stripe associated with this change -\neither an invoice line item, invoice, invoiceitem, charge, or etc.debitThe\ndebited accountcreditThe credited accountbooked_dateThe date that the ledger\nentry is added to the books.amountAmount change, expressed in major units of the\ncurrency (for example, dollars for USD, or pesos for MXN).debit_gl_codeThe\ndebited general ledger codecredit_gl_codeThe credited general ledger\ncodeinvoice_idThe invoice associated with this change.
