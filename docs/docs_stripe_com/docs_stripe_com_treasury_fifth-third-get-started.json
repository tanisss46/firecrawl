  "content": "# Build a new Treasury integration with Fifth Third BankPublic preview\n\n## Get started with Stripe Treasury.\n\nThis guide describes how to get started with Stripe Treasury using Fifth Third\nBank.\n\n## Before you integrate\n\n### Test mode\n\nYou can request access to use test mode immediately. Test mode operates\nindependently of any specific bank partner.\n\nBefore you create financial accounts in live mode for your Treasury integration,\nwe recommend that you create test financial accounts in test mode. Test mode\nfinancial accounts can’t receive or send real money, and don’t generate a live\naccount with real routing and account information, but are otherwise identical\nin configuration and functionality.\n\nIf you create an `Account` object in test mode and want to bypass onboarding\nrequirements to test functionality, use `POST\n/v1/accounts/{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}` to [provide test\nvalues](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/testing-verification) that fulfill all\nthe requirements.\n\n### Complete compliance reviews and update disclosures\n\nTo access Fifth Third in live mode, you must first submit evidence of the\nfollowing to Stripe’s compliance team for approval:\n\n- Any live or planned UX, or marketing that names a bank partner\n- Any mentions of FDIC pass-through insurance eligibility\n- UX including user balances with disclosures, bank statements, and transaction\nhistory\n\nYou must send previews of your planned updates using the [Compliance Intake\nForm](https://form.asana.com/?k=8K51UWmWhttehNFD5qBLdg&d=974470123217835). After\nStripe’s compliance team completes the review, we’ll grant you access to Fifth\nThird in live mode. Then, you can publish your approved disclosures.\n\nYou must follow all of the Treasury [compliance\nguidelines](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/compliance), including [regulatory\nreceipts](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/regulatory-receipts),\n[complaints](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/handling-complaints), and\n[marketing guidelines](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/marketing-treasury).\n\n### Bank partner disclosures\n\nYou must include proper disclosures that funds are held with Fifth Third Bank.\nYou must include disclosures on marketing assets, landing pages, other websites,\ndashboards, social media posts, or any other interface that references Stripe\nTreasury.\n\nMake sure that your disclosure reads: “[*Company Name*] partners with Stripe\nPayments Company for money transmission services and account services with funds\nheld at Fifth Third Bank, Member FDIC.”\n\n### FDIC pass-through insurance eligibility disclosures\n\nIn any place you reference FDIC pass-through insurance eligibility, you must\naccompany that text with the approved disclosure language from Fifth Third Bank:\n\n“Stripe Treasury Accounts are eligible for FDIC pass-through deposit insurance\nif they meet certain requirements. The accounts are eligible only to the extent\npassthrough insurance is permitted by the rules and regulations of the FDIC, and\nif the requirements for pass-through insurance are satisfied. The FDIC insurance\napplies up to 250,000 USD per depositor, per financial institution, for deposits\nheld in the same ownership capacity.”\n\n### Viewing multiple balances\n\nIf you plan to allow connected accounts to store multiple balances, you must\ndisplay balances separately within any dashboard user interface or servicing\ncommunications disclosing balances.\n\n## Feature availability on Fifth Third Bank\n\nThe following Treasury features are available when integrating with Fifth Third\nBank.\n\nCategoryFeatureOnboard and store funds with Fifth Third Bank [Onboard connected\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/account-management/connected-accounts)\ncompliantly[Create financial\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/account-management/financial-accounts)\nat Fifth Third Bank that are eligible for FDIC pass-through insurance[Close\nfinancial\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/account-management/financial-accounts#close-a-financialaccount)\nwith Fifth Third using the APIFinancial accounts come with a Stripe\nFinancialAccount IDFinancial accounts can request an externally addressable\naccount number and routing number\n([financial_addresses.aba](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/account-management/financial-account-features#available-features)),\nenabling them to receive external credits and debitsOriginate Transactions for\nthe financial account Connected account can move funds\n([OutboundTransfer](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/financial-accounts/out-of/outbound-transfers))\nfrom the Fifth Third financial account to other financial accounts (Evolve or\nFifth Third Bank) using the Stripe networkConnected accounts can originate\ncredits\n([OutboundTransfer](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/financial-accounts/out-of/outbound-transfers)\nor\n[OutboundPayment](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/financial-accounts/out-of/outbound-payments))\nout from the financial account using standard or\n[same-day](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/account-management/financial-account-features#same-day-ach)\nACH or wireConnected accounts can originate debits\n([InboundTransfer](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/financial-accounts/into/inbound-transfers))\nthat draw funds from accounts they own into the financial account using standard\nor\n[same-day](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/account-management/financial-account-features#same-day-ach)\nACH (self-to-self)Remote deposit capture for check deposit (beta)Payouts from\nStripe Payments You or your connected accounts can acquire funds using Stripe\nPayments, then create\n[Payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/payouts) into the Fifth\nThird financial account (others-to-self)You or your connected accounts can\ncreate [instant\npayouts](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/payouts#manual-payout-speeds)\nto access pending fundsReceive Transactions into the financial account Financial\naccounts can receive credits\n([ReceivedCredit](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/financial-accounts/into/received-credits))\nusing ACH or wireFinancial accounts can receive debits\n([ReceivedDebit](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/financial-accounts/out-of/received-debits))\nusing ACH, and can create returns\n([DebitReversal](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/financial-accounts/out-of/debit-reversals))Fund\nIssuing cards\n[Issuing](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/account-management/issuing-cards)\ncards can be funded by the Fifth Third financial accountAn existing Issuing card\ncan be updated to point to a different financial account\nAccounts that have migrated to Fifth Third don’t yet support\n[CreditReversals](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/financial-accounts/into/credit-reversals).\nWhen that feature becomes available, we’ll notify you.\n\nIf you request a [financial account\nFeature](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/account-management/financial-account-features)\nthat hasn’t been released for Fifth Third Bank, Stripe returns the following\nerror: “You cannot request `{feature}` on a financial account with bank\n`fifth_third`”.\n\n#### Note\n\nThe roadmap above outlines our general product direction and current priorities\nfor informational purposes only. It’s not a commitment to deliver any material,\ncode, or functionality, and you shouldn’t rely on it when making purchasing\ndecisions. The development, release, and timing of any features or functionality\ndescribed for Stripe’s products remain at Stripe’s sole discretion.\n\n## Get started with Treasury\n\nYou can use the existing [Treasury\ndocumentation](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury) to guide your integration. You\ncan use the same APIs with your Fifth Third financial account. Below is a list\nof expected differences with Fifth Third Bank.\n\n- You receive a [platform financial\naccount](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/account-management/platform-financial-account)\nat Fifth Third Bank.\n- Outbound transfers sent using wire or ACH from a Fifth Third financial account\nhave later cutoff times than today’s transfers sent with Evolve.\nEvolveFifth Third BankWires4:00pm ET5:00pm ETACH7:00pm ET8:30pm ETSame-day\nACH12:00pm ET1:00pm ET- Stripe Payouts sent from the payments balance will\narrive into a Fifth Third financial account faster than today’s payouts into an\nexternal bank account or an Evolve financial account.\nExternal payouts and payouts to Evolve financial accountsPayouts to Fifth Third\nfinancial accountsStandard manual payoutSettled funds arrive in approximately 1\nday.

For example.\n\n- Received debits: For now, you can only receive debits up to 500,000 USD per\ntransaction. If an external party originates a debit for an amount exceeding\n500,000 USD, Stripe originates a return with the R29 ACH return code. You won’t\nsee any impact to your balance, and the received debit won’t appear in your\ntransaction list. When we remove this limit, we’ll notify all platforms that\nhave gone live with Fifth Third and receive debits.\n- DebitReversals and CreditReversals: You must create a DebitReversal within 24\nhours; we’ll extend this window in the coming months.\n\n## Links\n\n- [provide test values](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/testing-verification)\n- [Compliance Intake\nForm](https://form.asana.com/?k=8K51UWmWhttehNFD5qBLdg&d=974470123217835)\n- [compliance guidelines](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/compliance)\n- [regulatory\nreceipts](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/regulatory-receipts)\n- [complaints](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/handling-complaints)\n- [marketing guidelines](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/marketing-treasury)\n- [Onboard connected\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/account-management/connected-accounts)\n- [Create financial\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/account-management/financial-accounts)\n- [Close financial\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/account-management/financial-accounts#close-a-financialaccount)\n-\n[financial_addresses.aba](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/account-management/financial-account-features#available-features)\n-\n[OutboundTransfer](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/financial-accounts/out-of/outbound-transfers)\n-\n[OutboundPayment](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/financial-accounts/out-of/outbound-payments)\n-\n[same-day](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/account-management/financial-account-features#same-day-ach)\n-\n[InboundTransfer](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/financial-accounts/into/inbound-transfers)\n- [Payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/payouts)\n- [instant\npayouts](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/payouts#manual-payout-speeds)\n-\n[ReceivedCredit](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/financial-accounts/into/received-credits)\n-\n[ReceivedDebit](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/financial-accounts/out-of/received-debits)\n-\n[DebitReversal](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/financial-accounts/out-of/debit-reversals)\n- [Issuing](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/account-management/issuing-cards)\n-\n[CreditReversals](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/financial-accounts/into/credit-reversals)\n- [financial account\nFeature](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/account-management/financial-account-features)\n- [Treasury documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury)\n- [platform financial\naccount](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/account-management/platform-financial-account)",
