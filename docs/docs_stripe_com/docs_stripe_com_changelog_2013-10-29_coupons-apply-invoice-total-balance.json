  "content": "# Coupons only apply to an invoice's total balance, no longer applying to zero-cost invoicesBreaking changes\n\n## What’s new\n\nChanges coupon behavior so that applying an amount-off coupon to an invoice\ndoesn’t increase the `Customer` account balance if the discount is greater than\nthe invoice amount. Coupons are ignored, and not counted as redeemed, when\napplied to zero-cost invoices. This change doesn’t apply to coupons created on\nan earlier API version.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis change to coupon behavior prevents unexpected increases in customer account\nbalances, and ignores coupons on zero-cost invoices.\n\n## Upgrade\n\n- [View your current API\nversion](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#view-your-api-version-and-the-latest-available-upgrade-in-workbench)\nin Workbench.\n- If you use an SDK, upgrade to the corresponding SDK version for this API\nversion.- If you don’t use an SDK, update your [API\nrequests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/versioning) to include `Stripe-Version:\n2013-10-29`\n- Upgrade the API version used for [webhook\nendpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks/versioning).\n- [Test your integration](https://docs.stripe.com/testing) against the new\nversion.\n- If you use Connect, [test your Connect\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/testing).\n- In Workbench, [perform the\nupgrade](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#perform-the-upgrade).
