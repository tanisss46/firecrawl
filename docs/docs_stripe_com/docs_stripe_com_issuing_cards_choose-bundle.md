# Choose your physical bundle

## Set up a standard or custom physical bundle.

Stripe helps you set up your physical bundle, which consists of a card, a
carrier (the letter sent to cardholders on which the card is affixed), and an
envelope. You have different options for both the standard and custom bundles.
For [bulk orders](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/cards/physical/bulk-issuance)
of multiple cards shipped to a single destination, we don’t include carriers.

## Standard bundle options

To get started, go directly to the
[Designs](https://dashboard.stripe.com/issuing/personalization-designs) tab in
the Issuing Dashboard. We prompt you to create a design by uploading your logo
and adding your carrier text.

The standard bundle includes the following:

- **Card:** A plastic black or white card with your logo (company logo).
- **Carrier:** A standard white tri-fold (paper is folded into three) with black
text.
- **Envelope:** Standard white.

You can create multiple standard bundle designs with different logos and carrier
text.

## Custom bundle options

Before the bundle becomes available in the Issuing Dashboard, we work with you
to design it and place a manufacturing order. To get started, contact your
account executive and review [Order a custom
bundle](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/cards/physical/order-custom-bundle). To
learn more about this process, see [Manufacturing and
personalizations](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/cards/choose-bundle#manufacturing-personalization).

The custom bundle includes the following:

- **Card:** Your custom design on a plastic, recycled plastic, or metal card.
- **Carrier:** Your custom design on a trifold carrier (paper is folded in
three) or bifold carrier (paper is folded in half). You can also pair your
custom card with the standard white trifold carrier.
- **Envelope:** White non-descript envelope (default) or we can add your logo or
brand color on the exterior.

Your design is printed during manufacturing, and can’t change after we produce
it. However, you can print an additional logo in black or white on the card
after manufacturing.

## Manufacturing and personalization

The credit card manufacturing process involves creating a card body, typically
made of plastic polyvinyl chloride (PVC), layered for increased durability and
security. We embed chips into the card for secure, contactless transactions. The
cards then undergo quality control and are shipped in bulk to the
personalization site using secure transport. We store your bundle at the site
and personalize it when you create cards in the Issuing Dashboard.

During personalization, the printer adds unique cardholder information to the
bundle, including the cardholder name, number, expiration, and security code to
the card. For the carrier, the printer adds the cardholder shipping address. In
some cases, the printer can add an additional logo on the card and activation
text on the carrier (for standard carriers only) during this stage.

To better illustrate the manufacturing and personalization process, see the
following diagram. Standard bundles are pre-manufactured and managed by Stripe,
allowing you to skip to step 5 and create and name your bundle design. A custom
bundle follows all the steps from 1 to 7.
