# Collect tax in Indonesia

## Learn how to use Stripe Tax to calculate, collect, and report tax in Indonesia.

In Indonesia, Stripe only supports collecting [VAT for digital goods and
services](https://www.pajak.go.id/en/digitaltax). In Stripe, these are referred
to as “digital products.” To collect this tax on Stripe, you must be a remote
seller without a physical presence in the country.

## When to register for tax collection

See [Thresholds](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/thresholds) to get insights
about your potential tax registration obligations in Indonesia. Stripe also
notifies you with email and Dashboard alerts when you need to register to
collect tax. Learn more about how the [monitoring tool
works](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/monitoring).

Remote sellers providing digital goods or electronically supplied services
(digital products) to Indonesian customers are appointed as VAT collectors when
they meet either of the following thresholds:

- The total value of digital goods and services provided to customers in
Indonesia exceeds IDR 600 million in a period of 12 months or IDR 50 million in
one calendar month.
- Website traffic in Indonesia exceeds 12,000 users in one year or 1,000 users
in one month.

Remote sellers who meet the registration thresholds can ask to be appointed a
VAT collector and start collecting VAT voluntarily but aren’t obligated to do
so.

Stripe only monitors the threshold of 50 million IDR per calendar month.

- **Threshold**: 50 million IDR
- **Time frame**: Calendar month
- **Included transactions**: Sales of digital goods and services

## How we calculate taxes

We only support calculations for [digital
products](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes?type=digital) (non-physical
items or services that are delivered, given, or rendered electronically) in
Indonesia. Stripe doesn’t calculate tax for products that don’t use a digital
product tax code.

View the list of supported [digital product tax
codes](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes?type=digital). To calculate taxes
in Indonesia, make sure that you [assign a tax
code](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/products-prices-tax-codes-tax-behavior#tax-code-on-product)
to each of your products.

## Report and file your taxes

Stripe provides reports of your completed tax transactions. Go to
[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations) to access these
reports. Learn more about [the different types of
reports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports).

You’re responsible for filing and remitting your taxes to Indonesia. Stripe
doesn’t file taxes on your behalf.
