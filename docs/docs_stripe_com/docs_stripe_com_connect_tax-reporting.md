# US tax reporting for Connect platforms

## Learn how to report the annual payments for your US-based connected accounts.

Stripe [Connect](https://stripe.com/connect) allows platforms to provide a
seamless, end-to-end payment service for their connected accounts. This service
may come with certain responsibilities, including tax information reporting.

#### Getting your 1099 Forms

If you work for a platform that pays you via Stripe and want to learn about your
1099 forms and how to get them, see [1099 tax
forms](https://support.stripe.com/express/topics/1099-tax-forms) on the Stripe
Support site.

Stripe issues 1099-K forms for your connected accounts that have transactions
where
[controller.fees.payer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-controller-fees-payer)
= `account` or `application_unified_accounts_beta`.

For transactions where `controller.fees.payer` = `application`, if your
connected accounts pay the processing fees for those transactions to Stripe,
they could be included in a Stripe-issued 1099.

For any other account setups that have transactions, Stripe wonâ€™t issue a 1099-K
to your connected accounts (for example, when `controller.fees.payer` =
`application_custom` or `application_express` or `application` where you pay the
processing fees). Instead, consider issuing a [Form
1099](https://support.stripe.com/questions/1099-tax-reporting-and-filing-for-platforms-and-marketplaces)
to report income and payment transactions. There are several types of 1099
forms, and the applicable form depends on the type of payments you make to your
connected account.

#### Note

Stripe recommends that you consult a tax advisor to determine your tax filing
and reporting requirements.
