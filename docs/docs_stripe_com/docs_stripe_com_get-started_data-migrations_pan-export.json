We make\nsure that you have access to this data—even if you’re moving elsewhere. If you\ndecide to leave Stripe for another payment processor, we’ll work with your new\nprocessor’s team to securely transfer your credit card data.\n\nTo meet [PCI\ncompliance](https://docs.stripe.com/security/guide#validating-pci-compliance)\nobligations, we can only transfer your card data to another PCI DSS Level\n1-compliant payment processor. Stripe requires the following information about\nthe processor receiving the data:\n\n- The processor’s current PCI Attestation of Compliance (AOC), or their listing\non [Visa’s Global Registry of Service\nProviders](https://usa.visa.com/splisting/splistingindex.html).\n- The processor’s PGP public encryption key, which must be 4096 bits or greater\nin length. This key must be hosted over HTTPS on one of the processor’s domain\nnames referenced in their AOC or Visa Registry listing.\n\nAfter you [let us\nknow](https://support.stripe.com/contact?email=true&subject=Migration+away+from+Stripe)\nwho your new payment processor is, we can usually confirm if they meet these\nrequirements.\n\n## Migratable data\n\nStripe can help you migrate your customer card information to a new payment\nprocessor. To do this securely, Stripe prepares an encrypted JSON export file\ncontaining your data, including the card details of your customers, email\naddresses, and any attached [metadata](https://docs.stripe.com/api#metadata). We\nthen arrange a secure transfer with your new processor, who uses this file to\nimport the data into their system. You can start the migration process by\n[contacting\nus](https://support.stripe.com/contact?email=true&subject=Migration+away+from+Stripe)\nwith the name of your new payment processor.\n\n```\n{\n \"customers\": [\n {\n \"id\": \"cus_abc123def456\",\n \"email\": \"jenny.rosen@example.com\",\n \"description\": \"Jenny Rosen\",\n \"default_source\": \"card_edf214abc789\",\n \"metadata\": {\n \"color_preference\": \"turquoise\",\n ...\n },\n \"cards\": [\n {\n \"id\": \"card_edf214abc789\",\n \"number\":\"4242424242424242\",\n \"name\": \"Jenny Rosen\",\n \"exp_month\": 1,\n \"exp_year\": 2020,\n \"address_line1\": \"123 Main St.\",\n \"address_line2\": null,\n \"address_city\": \"Springfield\",\n \"address_state\": \"MA\",\n \"address_zip\": \"01101\",\n \"address_country\": \"US\"\n },\n ...\n ]\n },\n ...\n ]\n}\n```\n\nStripe doesn’t export your account’s payment history, subscriptions, or other\nobjects. Instead, use the API or Dashboard to retrieve this information. You can\ncontinue to access your data through the Dashboard and API after you stop\nprocessing payments with us, as long as you don’t close or delete your account.\n\n#### Link transactions\n\nThe consumer payment credentials saved with Link transactions can’t be\ntransferred between payment processors. Any credentials saved through Link are\nexcluded from our exports.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Contact\nus](https://support.stripe.com/contact?email=true&subject=Migration+away+from+Stripe)\n- [PCI\ncompliance](https://docs.stripe.com/security/guide#validating-pci-compliance)\n- [Visa’s Global Registry of Service\nProviders](https://usa.visa.com/splisting/splistingindex.html)\n- [metadata](https://docs.stripe.com/api#metadata)",
