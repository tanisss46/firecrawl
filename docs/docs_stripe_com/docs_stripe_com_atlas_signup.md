# How to incorporate your company

## Learn what you need to get started with Atlas.

## What Atlas does for you

Stripe Atlas incorporates your company in Delaware, gets your company tax ID
(EIN) from the IRS, issues founders equity, and files your 83(b) election. After
incorporating you can open a business bank account, charge customers using
Stripe payments, and access discounts on tools for founders.

Atlas costs 500 USD, which covers incorporation (plus state fees), and your
first year of registered agent services. After that, we charge 100 USD annually
to maintain your registered agent. We’ll refund your fee if we’re unable to
support your business. Read more about Stripe Atlas’ [restricted business
categories](https://support.stripe.com/questions/stripe-atlas-restricted-business-categories).

Atlas provides legal information and self-serve tools that assist you in
providing this information, filling out template documents, and filing these
with the appropriate government offices. Atlas isn’t a law firm and doesn’t
provide legal, tax, or accounting advice. Atlas can’t guarantee that your
business will be approved to use Stripe payments. Using Atlas isn’t a substitute
for individual advice from qualified legal, tax, or accounting professionals.
Double-check that the documents we populate are aligned with your company’s
unique circumstances, because you will need to work with a lawyer to make any
changes after your incorporation documents are executed.

## When to consider talking to a lawyer before using Atlas

Atlas is appropriate for most founders, but not all. If you have unique
considerations such as any of the following, consider talking to a lawyer before
using Atlas. This list is not exhaustive.

- **You’re contributing significant intellectual property (IP) or other assets
to your company**. Atlas forms C corporations with an industry standard fair
market value (FMV) of 100 USD, which might not be accurate if you have
substantially valuable IP.
- **You have prior inventions you want to exclude from being assigned to your
company**. Atlas assigns all prior inventions relevant to your company to the
newly incorporated company.
- **You want to include non-compete or non-solicit clauses in your formation
documents**. Atlas omits non-compete and non-solicit clauses because they’re
state specific, change on a regular basis, and can be hard to enforce. If you
use Atlas, you can work with a lawyer to include them after incorporation.
- **You or your co-founders reside in India**. If you or any of your co-founders
live in India, Atlas is not suitable for you. Consider consulting a lawyer about
ODI laws in your country before proceeding.
- **You’re rolling over qualified small business stock (QSBS) gains from a
previous company to your new one**. Atlas automatically purchases shares on all
founders’ behalf using IP and doesn’t support purchasing stock with cash.
- **You don’t want to file an 83(b) election**. Atlas automatically files 83(b)
elections for all founders, a step that startup lawyers recommend, and one
expected by investors.

your company goals. Stripe Atlas supports forming Delaware C corporations,
limited liability companies (LLCs), and C corporation subsidiaries.
Company name

Enter a legal name for your company. The Atlas application checks if a name is
available in the State of Delaware, but you can also check if a name is
available on [Delaware’s
website](https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/eCorp/EntitySearch/NameSearch.aspx).

in incorporation documents. The IRS will send a physical copy of your EIN
confirmation letter to this address. You’ll also receive a digital copy of your
EIN confirmation letter from Atlas.Company US phone numberIf you don’t have a
company phone number, you can use a personal number or get a virtual phone
number through one of our partners. We include this only in your EIN application
to the IRS. This number won’t be publicly listed anywhere.

We need the following information about you and any co-founders:

- First and last name as they appear on a government ID
- Email address
- Date of birth (only for the founder who submits the Atlas application)
- SSN or ITIN (we include this in your EIN application and your 83(b) election)
- Home address (we use it to verify your identity, and in your 83(b) election.
We don’t share it or use it for marketing purposes. You won’t receive mail at
this address)

your future team if you’re creating a C corporation.
Roles and officers

Choose your company’s role and officers:

- Board of Directors (or LLC Managers): Choose who can make important company
decisions such as granting ownership, fundraising, or selling the company.
- C corporation and subsidiary roles: Name a President and Secretary for your

## How we use your information

Stripe uses your information to generate the legal documents necessary to form
your company in Delaware, get an EIN from the IRS, and file your [83(b)
election](https://docs.stripe.com/atlas/83b-election). If you apply to Stripe
payments or other Stripe products, your information goes through additional
review. The [Stripe Atlas Agreement](https://stripe.com/atlas/legal) and the
[Stripe Privacy Policy](https://stripe.com/us/privacy) have further detail about
the information we collect and how we use that information.

## After you sign your documents

After you sign and submit your application, we’ll review it within 1 business
day to ensure we have all necessary information. We’ll notify you if we need
more time or additional details about your company to complete your review. You
can track the status of your company in the [Atlas
Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/atlas).

## Company formation

Once we have all the information we need about your company, we’ll file your
incorporation paperwork with Delaware.

C corporationLLC
Incorporation in Delaware usually takes 1–2 business days. Immediately after
incorporation, Atlas automatically purchases shares on your behalf and issues
them to you. Atlas founders pay for their shares with IP developed on behalf of
the company.

If your company is a subsidiary of an existing company, you’ll need to issue
shares to your parent company after incorporation. Atlas provides a standard
template that you can customize with a lawyer based on your specific
circumstances.

## Payments and banking before receiving your tax ID

Atlas automatically gets your company an IRS tax ID, called an [Employer
Identification Number
(EIN)](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/employer-id-numbers),
after filing your incorporation in Delaware. *After incorporating with Atlas,
you can start accepting US card payments on Stripe, open a business bank account
with Mercury or Brex, and begin fundraising before the IRS assigns your EIN.*
Other third party services might require your EIN before you can start using
their products, and you’ll need it later to pay taxes and hire employees.

You can activate US card payments on Stripe for your Atlas company before
receiving your EIN. Stripe offers no-code payment options, including Payment
Links and Invoicing, and all Atlas companies get one year of free payments
processing on Stripe (up to 100,000 USD in revenue). Atlas sends you an email
when your company is incorporated in Delaware (typically 1–2 business days days
after you submit your application). You can activate Stripe Payments from that
email, or from your Atlas Dashboard, and Atlas automatically prefills the fields
that you completed during your Atlas application. You’ll need to submit a US
phone number (our partners in the Perks section of the Atlas Dashboard can help
if you need one). *You can only use Payouts to transfer your Stripe balance to
your bank account after you receive your EIN.* You can access additional payment
methods beyond US card payments only after your EIN is available.

The IRS typically processes EIN applications in 1–2 business days if you provide
a US company address, a US company phone number, and a US Social Security
number. If you don’t submit any of these three pieces of information, the IRS
could take 35–45 business days. Atlas emails you when your EIN is available.

## Getting your company tax ID from the IRS

Atlas automatically gets your EIN by filing [Form
SS-4](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fss4.pdf) with the IRS. You also complete
[Form 8821](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8821.pdf), which allows Atlas to
call the IRS on your behalf to get your company’s EIN as fast as possible.

If the founder filling out the Atlas application has a US Social Security Number
(SSN), a US address, and a US phone number, Atlas will automatically get their
company’s EIN in 1–2 business days after incorporation. If the founder doesn’t
have an SSN, Atlas will get their company’s EIN in 35–45 business days after
incorporation.

We make a few assumptions when we submit your company’s EIN application to the
IRS. We assume your company **doesn’t**:

- Have or expect to have any employees who will receive a Form W-2 in the next
12 months.
- Own a [highway motor
vehicle](https://sa.www4.irs.gov/modiein/individual/help/keyword.jsp?keyword=Highway%20Motor%20Vehicle)
with a [taxable gross
weight](https://sa.www4.irs.gov/modiein/individual/help/keyword.jsp?keyword=Taxable%20Gross%20Weight)
of 55,000 pounds or more.
- Need to file [Form
720](https://sa.www4.irs.gov/modiein/individual/help/keyword.jsp?keyword=Form%20%20720)
(Quarterly Federal Excise Tax Return).
- Involve [gambling or
wagering](https://sa.www4.irs.gov/modiein/individual/help/keyword.jsp?keyword=Gambling/Wagering).
- Sell or manufacture alcohol, tobacco, or firearms.

If any of these assumptions are incorrect prior to incorporation, please work
with a tax expert to file applicable employment taxes and/or excise taxes for
your company. Many companies hire employees after incorporation; our
[partners](https://support.stripe.com/questions/legal-and-tax-advice-for-your-stripe-atlas-company)
can help you do this compliantly.

#### Note

To get a company tax ID (EIN) using Stripe Atlas, begin by [creating an
account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register/atlas).

## Registered agent service

To maintain good standing, Delaware requires that companies have a registered
agent to receive official notices. The initial 500 USD setup fee includes one
year of registered agent services, which automatically renews each year for 100
USD. Your registered agent might contact you directly to share legal notices and
official communications from Delaware. Your registered agent address isn’t a
general purpose mail-forwarding address for your company and shouldn’t be listed
as a company address. You can separately use a virtual address service to
receive general mail, for customer contact, and to apply to open a bank account.
