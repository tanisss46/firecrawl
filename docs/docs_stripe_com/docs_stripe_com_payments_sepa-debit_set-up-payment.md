#### Note

SEPA Direct Debit is a **delayed notification payment method**, which means that
funds are not immediately available after payment. A payment typically takes **5
business days** to arrive in your account.

[Create or retrieve a
CustomerServer-side](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sepa-debit/set-up-payment#create-retrieve-customer)
To reuse a SEPA Direct Debit payment method for future payments, it must be
attached to a [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers).

Create a Customer object when your customer creates an account with your
business. Associating the ID of the Customer object with your own internal
representation of a customer enables you to retrieve and use the stored payment
method details later.

Create a new customer or retrieve an existing customer to associate with this
payment. Include the following code on your server to create a new customer.

```
curl -X POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers \
 -u "sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:"
```

 mode: 'setup',
 payment_method_types: ['card'],
 payment_method_types: ['card', 'sepa_debit'],
 customer: customer.id,
 success_url: 'https://example.com/success',
