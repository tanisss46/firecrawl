  "content": "# Extended authorizations\n\n## Capture a confirmed Stripe Terminal payment later.\n\nExtended authorizations allow you to capture a\n[confirmed](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/confirm)\n[PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object) up to 30\ndays later, depending on the card brand and whether your business is in an\neligible category. This is helpful if you need more than the typical 48 hours\n(or 5 days for Visa) between authorization and payment capture. For example, a\nhotel authorizes a payment in full when a guest checks in, but captures the\npayment when the guest checks out.\n\n## Availability\n\nExtended authorization is available on Visa, Mastercard, American Express and\nDiscover. Extended authorizations are not supported on single-message payment\nmethods like\n[Interac](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/regional?integration-country=CA#interac-payments)\nand\n[eftpos](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/regional?integration-country=AU#eftpos-payments).\n\n#### Note\n\nYou can contact [support](https://support.stripe.com/contact) if you’re unsure\nabout the eligibility of your merchant business category. If you’re a\n[Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect) user, [set the merchant category\ncode](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/setting-mcc) for your connected accounts\nto match their businesses.\n\n## Request extended authorization support\n\nWhen you create a `PaymentIntent`, you can request to extend the capture window\nof the payment. Set the\n[request_extended_authorization](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-payment_method_options-card_present-request_extended_authorization)\nfield to `true` and the\n[capture_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-capture_method)\nto `manual`.\n\nServer-sideiOSAndroidReact Native\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d amount=1000 \\\n -d currency=usd \\\n -d \"payment_method_types[]\"=card_present \\\n -d capture_method=manual \\\n -d \"payment_method_options[card_present][request_extended_authorization]\"=true\n```\n\nIn the response, the\n[capture_before](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-payment_method_details-card_present-capture_before)\nfield indicates the time when the authorization expires. Failure to capture the\npayment by this time cancels the authorization and releases the funds. When this\nhappens, the [PaymentIntent\nstatus](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/paymentintents/lifecycle) transitions\nto `canceled`.\n\n## Authorization validity\n\nEvery card network and card brand has a different rule for how long an\nauthorization is valid. With Terminal, an authorization for in-person payments\nis valid for at least two days. Because authorization rules can change without\nprior notice, use the\n[capture_before](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-payment_method_details-card_present-capture_before)\nfield to determine the validity window for an authorization.\n\n#### Note\n\nThe `capture_before` field is located on the\n[Charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object), so it is only present\nafter the `PaymentIntent` is confirmed.\n\nCard brand Merchant category Extended authorization validity window VisaHotel,\nlodging, vehicle rental, and cruise line30 days*\n**Visa**\n\nAircraft rental, bicycle rental (including electric scooters), boat rental,\nclothing and costume rental, DVD and video rental, equipment and tool rental,\nfurniture rental, motor home rental, motorcycle rental, and trailer parks and\ncampgrounds\n\n10 days**\n\nMastercard (not including Maestro or Cirrus cards)All merchant categories30\ndaysAmerican ExpressLodging and vehicle rental30 days***DiscoverAirline, bus\ncharter/tour, car rental, cruise line, local/suburban commuter, passenger\ntransportation including ferries, hotel, lodging, and passenger railway30 days\n* The exact extended authorization window is 29 days and 18 hours, to allow time\nfor clearing processes.** The exact extended authorization window is 9 days and\n18 hours, to allow time for clearing processes.*** While your validity window is\nextended to 30 days, you must capture the authorized funds no later than the end\nof the duration of your customer’s stay or rental.\n\n## Links\n\n- [confirmed](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/confirm)\n- [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object)\n-\n[Interac](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/regional?integration-country=CA#interac-payments)\n-\n[eftpos](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/regional?integration-country=AU#eftpos-payments)\n- [support](https://support.stripe.com/contact)\n- [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)\n- [set the merchant category code](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/setting-mcc)\n-\n[request_extended_authorization](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-payment_method_options-card_present-request_extended_authorization)\n-\n[capture_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-capture_method)\n-\n[capture_before](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-payment_method_details-card_present-capture_before)\n- [PaymentIntent\nstatus](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/paymentintents/lifecycle)\n- [Charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object)",
