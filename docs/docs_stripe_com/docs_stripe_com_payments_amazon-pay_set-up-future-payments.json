[Register\nnow](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register).\n\nUse our official libraries for access to the Stripe API from your application:\n\n```\n# Available as a gem\nsudo gem install stripe\n```\n\n```\n# If you use bundler, you can add this line to your Gemfile\ngem 'stripe'\n```\n\n[Getting permission to save a payment\nmethodServer-side](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/amazon-pay/set-up-future-payments#web-permissions)\nIf you save your customer’s payment method for future use, you need permission.\nCreating an agreement (sometimes called a mandate) up front allows you to save\nyour customer’s payment details and charge them when they’re not actively using\nyour website or app.\n\nAdd terms to your website or app that state how you plan to save your customer’s\npayment method details, and let them opt in. If you plan to charge your customer\nwhen they’re offline, make sure that your terms also include the following:\n\n- The customer’s permission for you to initiate a payment or a series of\npayments on their behalf for specified transactions\n- The anticipated frequency (that is, one-time or recurring) and timing of\npayments\n- How you determine the payment amount\n- Your cancellation policy, if you’re setting up the payment method for a\nsubscription service\n\nMake sure that you keep a record of your customer’s written agreement to these\nterms.\n\n[Create or retrieve a\nCustomerServer-side](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/amazon-pay/set-up-future-payments#web-create-customer)\nTo reuse an Amazon Pay payment method for future payments, attach it to a\n[Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers).\n\nCreate a [Customer object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers) when your\ncustomer creates an account with your business, and associate the ID of the\nCustomer object with your own internal representation of that customer.\nAlternatively, you can create a new Customer before saving a payment method for\nfuture payments.\n\nCreate a new Customer or retrieve an existing Customer to associate with this\npayment. Include the following code on your server to create a new Customer:\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n --data-urlencode description=\"My First Test Customer (created for API docs)\"\n```\n\n[Create a Checkout\nSessionServer-side](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/amazon-pay/set-up-future-payments#web-create-checkout-session)\nYour customer must authorize you to use their Amazon account for future payments\nthrough Stripe Checkout. This allows you to accept Amazon payments. Add a\ncheckout button to your website that calls a server-side endpoint to create a\n[Checkout Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions).\n\n```\n<html>\n <head>\n <title>Checkout</title>\n </head>\n <body>\n <form action=\"/create-checkout-session\" method=\"POST\">\n <button type=\"submit\">Checkout</button>\n </form>\n </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nCreate a Checkout Session in `setup` mode to collect the required information.\nAfter creating the Checkout Session, redirect your customer to the\n[URL](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object#checkout_session_object-url)\nthat the response returns.\n\n```\nStripe::Checkout::Session.create({\n mode: 'setup',\n payment_method_types: ['card'],\n payment_method_types: ['card', 'amazon_pay'],\n customer: customer.id,\n success_url: 'https://example.com/success',\n cancel_url: 'https://example.com/cancel',\n})\n```\n\n[Test your\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/amazon-pay/set-up-future-payments#web-test-integration)\nSelect Amazon Pay as the payment method, then click **Continue to Amazon Pay**.\nYou can test the successful setup case by authenticating the SetupIntent on the\nredirect page. The SetupIntent transitions from requires_action to succeeded.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout)\n- [set up a subscription with Amazon\nPay](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/amazon-pay)\n- [Register now](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register)\n- [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers)\n- [Checkout Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions)\n-\n[URL](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object#checkout_session_object-url)\n- [https://example.com/success](https://example.com/success)\n- [https://example.com/cancel](https://example.com/cancel)",
