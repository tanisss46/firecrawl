  "content": "# Customer support for Issuing and Treasury\n\n## Resolve common Issuing and Treasury questions and issues.\n\nTo prepare you for assisting your customers, employees, or contractors, this\nguide provides example issues and resolutions for both\n[Issuing](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/customer-support#issuing-issues-resolutions)\nand\n[Treasury](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/customer-support#treasury-issues-resolutions).\nYou’re responsible for responding to these questions, and your level of\ninteraction with individual customers and cardholders might vary based on your\nspecific use case.\n\nStripe recommends equipping your team with the necessary information and tools.\nThis could involve augmenting your existing customer or technical support tools\nusing Stripe’s APIs or training your support team to manage questions using the\n[Dashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/connect#using-dashboard-issuing).\n\n- **Embedded Finance users:** If your business, using Stripe Connect, issues\ncards to customers or enables customers to issue cards to their employees or\ncontractors, it’s your responsibility to oversee all interactions with these\ncustomers (connected accounts).\n\n- It’s crucial to provide customers with a way to reach out for support, whether\nthrough a self-serve support page or a dedicated support team.\n- Typically, restrict questions to your customers’ admin users, such as finance\nor accounting teams.\n- **B2B Payments users:** Businesses that issue cards for their own use,\nemployees, or contractors using a Direct Issuing integration must make sure that\na dedicated team manages the cardholder experience.\n\n- You must let this team use the Stripe Dashboard or API to respond to employee\nquestions and concerns.\n\nIf your team is unable to resolve a question or issue using the existing\nresources, [contact our support team](https://support.stripe.com/contact/login).\nWe’ll investigate the issue and provide you with an outcome that you can relay\nback to your customer or employee.\n\n## Issuing issues and resolutions\n\nRefer to the following table when answering common Issuing issues:\n\nTopicIssue typeResolutionOrdering and replacing cards Lost or stolen cards[Make\nan API\ncall](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/cards/replacements#replacements-for-lost-or-stolen-cards)\nto immediately cancel and replace any physical or virtual cards reported as\ncompromised.If any authorizations were approved on a compromised card, you might\n[dispute the transactions](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/purchases/disputes)\nas fraud.Expired or damaged physical cards[Make an API\ncall](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/cards/replacements) to replace physical\ncards that are expired or damaged.Delayed physical cardsDelays in card\nmanufacturing can occur if there is a pending [cardholder watchlist\nscreening](https://support.stripe.com/questions/issuing-watchlist-reviews).\nEnsure that the cardholder is active and has fulfilled all necessary\nrequirements. If you have chosen the Standard shipping method, which does not\nprovide tracking, and the cardholder has not received the card within 10\nbusiness days, we recommend canceling and ordering a replacement (Stripe will\ncredit the creation and shipment cost back to you).Alternatively, if you have\nselected Express or Priority shipping methods, which include tracking, you can\nretrieve the tracking number from the Dashboard or [via the\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/object#issuing_card_object-shipping-tracking_number).Cardholder\nexperience Authorization declined[Make an API\ncall](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/object#issuing_authorization_object-request_history-reason)\nto retrieve the authorization and review the request_history.reason.Cancel\npending authorizationInform the cardholder that it is not possible to cancel\npending authorizations. Only the acquiring merchant can void an\nauthorization.Advise customers that the authorization will automatically expire\n7 days after creation (31 days if hotels, airlines, and car rental companies)\nand the held funds will be released at that time.Missing refund[Make an API\ncall](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/transactions/list#list_issuing_transactions-type)\nto retrieve a list of transactions associated with the card where the type is\n`refund`.Stripe attempts to link refunds to original transactions. If this does\nnot happen, you can review the amount and merchant data across all results to\nidentify a match.Disputing a transactionEnsure that the cardholder has exhausted\nother means of resolving the issue, and obtain documentation of these attempts\nto use as evidence when filing the dispute.Make an API call to\n[create](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/purchases/disputes?dashboard-or-api=api)\nand\n[submit](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/purchases/disputes?dashboard-or-api=api#submission)\na dispute on behalf of the cardholder.Dispute loss reasonIf you are interested\nin the ability to retrieve a dispute loss reason via API, apply for the beta by\n[submitting your interest](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/purchases/disputes)\nwhile logged into your platform account. If you do not have access to the beta,\n[contact support](https://support.stripe.com/) for more information that you can\nrelay to the cardholder regarding why a dispute was lost.Excessive PIN retriesIf\na card’s PIN is entered incorrectly three consecutive times, the PIN becomes\nblocked and the card becomes inactive. In most countries, cardholders can\n[unblock a card’s PIN at an\nATM](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/cards/pin-management#changing-a-cards-pin-at-an-atm).Users\nwho are gated into the encrypted PIN management feature might also [change the\nPIN](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/cards/pin-management#changing-a-pin-with-the-cards-api)\nfor an issued card using the Card Update API. However, depending on the region\nthe card is used in, the new PIN might not be immediately usable.Once the pin is\nunblocked, you will need to [make an API\ncall](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/update#update_issuing_card-status)\nto update the card status to active.

If configured,\nrequest screenshots from the cardholder of the error message being surfaced.\n[Contact support](https://support.stripe.com/) for in-depth troubleshooting\nassistance once you have obtained documentation from the cardholder.Fraud\nmanagement Turning on 3DSConfirm your customer understands that 3DS can only be\nturned on at the connected account level, meaning they will not be able to\ntoggle the feature on or off for individual cardholders.After the feature is\nenabled, acquiring merchants might immediately start challenging\ncard-not-present authorization requests for any users that have linked a phone\nnumber or email address to the card or cardholder.Once you’re ready, [contact\nsupport](https://support.stripe.com/) to request 3DS be enabled and provide the\nStripe ID of the connected account.Update spending controlsMake an API call to\nupdate the spending controls on the [cardholder\nobject](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cardholders/object#issuing_cardholder_object-spending_controls)\nor the [card\nobject](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cardholders/object#issuing_cardholder_object-spending_controls)\nitself.Enabling fraud challenges betaIf you are providing cardholders with\nnotice of suspected fraud and the ability to override this warning, [apply for\nenrollment in the\nbeta](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/controls/fraud-challenges) by submitting\nyour interest while logged into your platform account.Issuing balance Top-ups\nfrom external bank account[Make an API\ncall](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/connect/funding) to add funds to a\nconnected account’s Issuing balance.
