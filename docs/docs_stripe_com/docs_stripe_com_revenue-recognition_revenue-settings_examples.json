The 120 USD is recognized across\n15.5 days in June, 31 days in July, 31 days in August, 30 days in September and\n12.5 days in October. We can use this example to demonstrate the differences\nbetween our supported amortization methods.\n\nIf you looked at the summary after October ends, amortization by millisecond\napplied, you might see something like:\n\nAccountJunJulAugSepOctRevenue+15.50+31.00+31.00+30.00+12.50DeferredRevenue+104.50-31.00-31.00-30.00-12.50\nIf you looked at the summary after October ends, amortization by day applied,\nyou might see something like:\n\nAccountJunJulAugSepOctRevenue+16.00+31.00+31.00+30.00+12.00DeferredRevenue+104.00-31.00-31.00-30.00-12.00\nIf you looked at the summary after October ends, amortization by month evenly\napplied, you might see something like:\n\nAccountJunJulAugSepRevenue+30.00+30.00+30.00+30.00DeferredRevenue+90.00-30.00-30.00-30.00\nIf you looked at the summary after October ends, amortization by month evenly,\nfirst and last month prorated applied, you might see something like:\n\nAccountJunJulAugSepOctRevenue+15.50+30.66+30.66+30.68+12.50DeferredRevenue+104.50-30.66-30.66-30.68-12.50\n## Catch-up revenue\n\nThis example uses the following assumptions:\n\n- On November 1st, 2024, at 00:00:00 UTC, a customer is billed for an\n[invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices) that costs 92 USD.\n- The invoice has service periods from Oct 1, 2024 to Jan 1, 2025 for all of its\nline items.\n- The invoice finalizes and the customer pays 92 USD.\n\nIn this example, the service period for the transaction begins prior to the\ninvoice finalization, triggering the catch-up revenue effect. We can use this\nexample to demonstrate the differences between enabling and disabling catch-up\nrevenue.\n\nAfter December ends, with catch-up revenue enabled, the summary might look like:\n\nAccountNovDecRevenue+61.00+31.00DeferredRevenue+31.00-31.00\nAfter December ends, with catch-up revenue disabled, the summary might look\nlike:\n\nAccountOctNovDecRevenue+31.00+30.00+31.00DeferredRevenue+31.00 (= +61.00 +\n-30.00)-31.00UnbilledAccountsReceivable+31.00-31.00AccountsReceivable+92.00\n\n## Links\n\n- [invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)",
