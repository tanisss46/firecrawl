  "content": "# Accept international payments from IndiaInvite only\n\n## When buyers of your goods or services are located outside India.\n\n#### Note\n\nStripe is available by invite only in India. This means that businesses from\nIndia can’t sign up for a new Stripe account through our website, and must\n[request an invite](https://stripe.com/in/contact/sales) instead. We currently\nonly support a select number of businesses, with a focus on international\nexpansion.\n\nStripe supports presentment in 135+ currencies on Visa and Mastercard, and INR\nor USD currencies on American Express. You can prevent declines caused by a\nmistaken perception of a fraudulent charge and increase your success rates by\npresenting your international payments in your customer’s local currency.\n\nTo present in a non-INR currency, you must provide additional information during\naccount onboarding and in API requests. Declare these transactions as exports\nfrom India and localize your [presentment\ncurrency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#presentment-currencies) to match\nthat of the customer’s card (for example, USD, EUR, JPY, and so on).\n\nFor more information, see our [India\nFAQ](https://support.stripe.com/questions/india-faq).\n\n## Requirements\n\nStripe supports both INR and non-INR presentment for customers located outside\nIndia, provided:\n\n- The Stripe account must be a registered Indian business (sole proprietorship,\nlimited liability partnership, or company).\n- The Stripe business can’t be an\n[individual](https://support.stripe.com/questions/how-can-i-open-a-stripe-account-in-india).\n- If you sell physical goods, you must provide a valid Importer Exporter Code\n(IEC).\n- If you sell services, providing an IEC is optional, unless:- You accept AMEX\npayments from international customers.\n- You take any benefits under India’s Foreign Trade Policy.\n\n## Onboarding\n\nTo enable export transactions, you must do the following when submitting your\naccount application:\n\n- **Opt in to exports**: In the account application, under **I am exporting\nproducts to customers located outside India**, select the applicable box. If you\ndon’t opt in, you can only make export charges in a\n[sandbox](https://docs.stripe.com/sandboxes). This option is only available for\ncertain users (sole proprietorship, limited liability partnership, or company).\n- **Submit your importer/exporter code (IEC)**: The IEC is a code issued by the\nIndian Director General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) to Indian companies that intend\nto export from India. You can apply for an IEC on the [DGFT\nwebsite](https://dgft.gov.in/CP/).\n\nYou must provide an IEC under certain conditions:\n\n- If you plan to accept Visa or Mastercard and you sell physical goods.\n- If you plan to accept [AMEX international\npayments](https://support.stripe.com/questions/american-express-card-support-for-india-based-businesses)\nfor all export transactions, including selling physical goods and services, as\ndescribed by India’s Foreign Trade Policy.\n- **Specify a transaction purpose code**: The [transaction purpose\ncode](https://docs.stripe.com/india-accept-international-payments#TransactionPurposeCode)\ndescribes the nature of a payment received in foreign currency. The Reserve Bank\nof India (RBI) maintains the list of valid transaction purpose codes. You must\nselect the code that’s closest to your product from the dropdown in the account\napplication.\n\n### Opt in or update export details after account activation\n\nYou can opt into the ability to enable exports, change your IEC (if applicable),\nor change your transaction purpose code at any time through the\n[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/update). If needed, you can\nuse the same IEC for multiple export businesses, as long as the IEC is in the\nname of a common beneficial owner of both businesses.\n\nA Stripe account can only have a single transaction purpose code.\n\n### Valid charges\n\nProvide these additional fields for every international payment presented to a\ncustomer holding a non-India issued card to meet regulatory reporting\nrequirements:\n\n- The buyer’s `name`\n- The `billing address` with a valid [2-alphabet\nISO-3166](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) country code\n- The charge `description`\n- The `shipping address` with a valid [2-alphabet\nISO-3166](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) country code, if you\nsell physical goods\n\n### Payouts\n\nStripe pays out to you in INR the funds collected from domestic and\ninternational payments. If you process both domestic and international payments,\nyou might receive two payouts on the same day, with an **International** label\nfor the relevant [payouts in your\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payouts).\n\n## International payments for services\n\nProvide the following fields for every international payment for services to\nmeet our financial partners’ requirements:\n\n- The buyer’s `name`\n- The `billing address`\n- A `description` of the service to export\n\nYou must provide this information to prevent the payment from failing.\n\nTo declare a payment as an export transaction:\n\n- Pass the service description in the Payment Intents API:\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents \\\n -u

[3D Secure\n(3DS)](https://support.stripe.com/questions/3d-secure-authentication-for-international-card-payments-to-indian-businesses).\n\n## Accept recurring international payments\n\nYou can use [Stripe Billing](https://docs.stripe.com/billing) to bill your\ninternational customers using\n[subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating) and\n[invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices).\n\nFor recurring international payments related to services, you must provide a\nbuyer’s `name` and an `address`.\n\n```\ncurl

international customers, 3D Secure isn’t mandatory, but you\nmight notice a higher dispute rate than when you sell to Indian customers.\n\nWe often see [disputes](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes) from customers\nclaiming that they were charged even after they canceled their subscription.\nHere are some best practices to avoid these disputes:\n\n- Make it clear on your signup page that your customers are agreeing to a\nrecurring payment and include information about whether or not you plan to\nnotify the customer before each payment. Make sure cancellation procedures are\nclearly communicated to your customers, and clearly state the window during\nwhich your customer can cancel a subscription. Include copies of these\nprocedures in a visible terms of service page.\n- If you offer a free or discounted trial period, be sure to clearly communicate\nthe length of the trial and the date when your customer is billed the full\nprice. Clearly display the amount of the standard pricing above the payment\nbutton on your checkout page.\n- Cancel subscriptions within two business days of initial request, making sure\nto pass the cancellation along to Stripe if you use our subscription\nfunctionality. Per card network rules, you can only make eight attempts per card\nafter an initial decline, so be sure to close out any subscriptions that have\nalready reached this limit. Provide your customer with a confirmation of the\ncancellation.\n- Have a clear way for customers to contact you if requesting cancellation. If\ncustomers have questions about their subscription, they’re more likely to submit\na dispute if they can’t contact you. You can track your overall dispute activity\nunder the Analytics section in your Dashboard.\n\n## Monthly payment advice for export transactions\n\nStandard Chartered Bank (SCB) issues payment advice directly to your registered\nStripe email address the same day your export payout is processed. This includes\na list of export charges that are part of the specific export payout.\n\n## Transaction purpose codes\n\nIf you have a Stripe account, you can select the following transaction purpose\ncodes during account onboarding or in the Dashboard. Select the code that best\naligns with your business. Stripe can’t support codes not listed below due to\nrequirements from our financial partner.\n\nPurpose code groupCodeDescriptionExports (of Goods)P0102Realization of export\nbills (in respect of goods) sent on collection (full invoice value).
