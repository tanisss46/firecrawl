For example:\n\n![On the left, a green check Toast on download. On the right, a red Notice on\nerror.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/communicating-state.a613d037f8e0b3bd8a6aa7199e708c8d.png)\n\n## Examples\n\nConsider the following attributes when choosing to deliver a message.\n\nToastBanner\n\n![Green check Toast example with text 'Changes\nsaved'](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/Toast.e17b36572b25d60725b4bc24098b77b9.png)\n\n![ Banner example with text 'New\nupdates'](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/Notice.0435a3a4999b7189e67fba5c18dae242.png)\n\n**Display**\n\n**Temporary**\n\nAll toasts trigger on usersâ€™ actions. Toasts dismiss automatically after a short\nperiod or when the app closes.\n\n**Persistent**\n\nYou can deliver banners at any time. Dismissing a banner requires an action.\n\n**Content**\n\n**Limited text length**\n\nMessages for toasts should be short, and fewer than four words on one line. The\nmaximum character length for a toast is 30.\n\n**Medium to long message**\n\nBanners contain title and body text. Banners are suitable for providing\ninformation with additional details.\n\n**Action**\n\n**Optional**\n\nProvide an action as a shortcut for users to quickly enter the related event.\n\n**Required**\n\nInform users to take the required action.\n\nPositionBottom of the app drawerUnder app drawer header\n\n## Links\n\n- [Create an app](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/create-app)\n- [Toast](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/components/toast)\n- [Banner](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/components/banner)",
