Boleto is a\nvoucher with a generated number that\n[Customers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers) can obtain from an ATM, a\nbank, an online bank portal, or an authorized agency.\n\n[Enable Boleto\nemails](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/boleto/set-up-invoices#enable-boleto-emails)\nBefore you start your integration, go to **Manage payments that require\nconfirmation** in your [Subscriptions and emails\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/automatic) and enable\n**Send a Stripe-hosted link for customers to confirm their payments when\nrequired**.\n\n[Decide the collection\nmethod](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/boleto/set-up-invoices#set-collection-method)\nYou can set the collection method in the Dashboard or\n[API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create#create_invoice-collection_method).\nFor invoices, you can choose to either send an invoice or charge your customer\nautomatically. If you’re using the API, the `send_invoice` and\n`charge_automatically` values determine the collection method.\n\nSend invoiceCharge automaticallyWhen to use- Your customer hasn’t defined their\npreferred payment method to pay invoices or subscriptions. In this case, you\nwant to give them the option to use either a credit card or Boleto.\n- You’re missing important customer information required to use Boleto (full\nname, address, and tax ID).\n- Your customer already chose to pay for their invoices or subscriptions using\nboletos.\n- You have the customer information needed to create an invoice that uses Boleto\n(full name, address, and tax ID).\nCustomer experience- Your customer needs to reenter their personal information\ndetails (full name, address, and tax ID) every time you send a new invoice, or\nfor each new subscription cycle. This collection method doesn’t take into\naccount the default payment method associated with that customer.\n- Your customer has Boleto set up as their default payment method. Your customer\nreceives an email with a Boleto voucher every time you send them an invoice, or\nthere’s a subscription cycle.\nExpiration and due dates- The invoice must contain a due date.\n- Stripe creates the boleto—regardless of the invoice due date—as soon as your\ncustomer enters the needed details. Because boletos have their own expiration\ndate (the default is 3 days), the invoice due date and the boleto expiration\ndate won’t necessarily match. The boleto might expire before or after the\ninvoice is due.\n- The invoice doesn’t have a due date.\n- Stripe creates the boleto when the merchant creates the invoice with a\nselected expiration date (the default is 3 days).\n[Create a\ncustomer](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/boleto/set-up-invoices#create-customers)\nCreate a customer for every new user or business you want to bill. When you\ncreate a new customer, set up a [minimal customer\nprofile](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/boleto/set-up-invoices#customer-profile)\nto help generate more useful invoices, and enable Smart Retries (if you’re an\n[Invoicing Plus](https://stripe.com/invoicing/pricing) user). After you set up\nyour customer, you can issue one-off invoices or create\n[subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating).\n\n#### Caution\n\nBefore you create a new customer, make sure that the customer doesn’t already\nexist in the Dashboard. Creating multiple customer entries for the same customer\ncan cause you problems later on, such as when you need to reconcile transaction\nhistory or coordinate saved payment methods.\n\nDashboardAPI\nYou can create and manage customers on the [Customers\npage](https://dashboard.stripe.com/customers) when you don’t want to use code to\ncreate a customer, or if you want to manually bill a customer with a one-off\ninvoice.\n\n#### Note\n\nYou can also create a customer in the Dashboard during invoice creation.\n\n### Create a customer\n\nWhen you create a new customer, you can set their account and billing\ninformation, such as **Email**, **Name**, and **Country**. You can also set a\ncustomer’s preferred language, currency, and other important details.\n\nTo create a customer, complete these steps:\n\n- Verify that the customer doesn’t already exist.\n- Click **Add customer**, or press **N**, on the **Customers** page.\n- At a minimum, enter your customer’s **Name** and **Account email**.\n- Click **Add customer** in the dialog.\n\n### Edit a customer\n\nTo edit a customer’s profile, complete these steps:\n\n- Find the customer you want to modify and click the name on the **Customers**\npage.\n- In the account information page, select **Actions** > **Edit information**.\n- Make your changes to the customer profile.\n- Click **Update customer**.\n\n### Delete a customer\n\nTo delete a customer, complete these steps:\n\n- Find the customer you want to delete on the **Customers** page.\n- Click the checkbox next to your customer’s name followed by **Delete**. You\ncan also click into the customer’s details page and select **Actions** >\n**Delete customer**.\n[Create a product and\nprice](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/boleto/set-up-invoices#create-product-price)\nDefine all your business and product offerings in one place.\n[Products](https://docs.stripe.com/api/products) define what you sell and\n[Prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices) track how much and how often to\ncharge. This is a core entity within Stripe that works with\n[subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating),\n[invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices), and\n[Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout).\n\nPrices enable these use cases:\n\n- A software provider that charges a one-time setup fee whenever a user creates\na new subscription.\n- An e-commerce store that sends a recurring box of goods for 10 USD per month\nand wants to allow customers to purchase one-time add-ons.\n- A professional services firm that can now create a standard list of services\nand choose from that list per invoice instead of typing out each line item by\nhand.\n- A non-profit organization that allows donors to define a custom recurring\ndonation amount per customer.\n\nYou can manage your product catalog with products and prices. Products define\nwhat you sell and prices track how much and how often to charge. Manage your\nproducts and their prices in the Dashboard or through the API.\n\nDashboardAPI\nIf you used the Dashboard in test mode to set up your business, you can copy\neach of your products over to live mode by using ** to live mode** in the\n[Product catalog page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/products). Use our official\nlibraries to access the Stripe API from your application.\n\n- Navigate to the **Product catalog** page, and click **Add product**.\n- Select whether you want to create a **One-time product**, or a **Recurring\none-time product**.\n- Give your product a name, and assign it a price.\n[Create and send an\ninvoice](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/boleto/set-up-invoices#create-invoice)\nTo create and send an invoice, complete these steps:\n\nDashboardAPI- In the Dashboard, go to the [Invoices overview\npage](https://dashboard.stripe.com/invoices), then click **Create Invoice** to\nopen the [invoice editor](https://dashboard.stripe.com/invoices/create).\nWhenever you exit the invoice editor, Stripe saves a draft. To delete a draft\ninvoice, click the overflow menu () next to an invoice on the [Invoices\npage](https://dashboard.stripe.com/invoices).\n- Choose an existing customer by entering their name.\n- Select your product under **Items**, and enter the **Quantity**. Stripe\nautomatically populates the product’s price based on what you selected when you\nfirst created the product.\n- Optional Click **Item options** if you need to add a tax rate, coupon, or\nsupply date.\n\n#### Note\n\nUse the Dashboard to create a [tax rate](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax-rates)\nor [coupon](https://dashboard.stripe.com/coupons/create).\n- Optional Use the **Memo** box to provide more information to your customer.\nYou can edit the memo on an invoice by clicking **Edit memo** on its details\npage.\n- Select the following invoice delivery option, depending on whether you want to\nsend the invoice or charge your customer automatically:\n\n#### Note\n\nIf you want to automatically charge your customer using Boleto, navigate to the\n[Customers page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/customers), click on the customer,\nand select **Add Boleto** under Payment methods.\n\n- **Automatically charge a payment method on file**—Immediately charges the\ninvoice amount to the payment method that you have on file for the customer.\n(Select **Boleto** as the payment option.)\n- **Email invoice with link**—Enables Stripe to send an email with a payment\npage and an invoice PDF. (Select **Boleto** and **card** as the payment\noptions.)\n- Optional To schedule this invoice to finalize automatically at some date in\nthe future, select **Schedule send date**. Or, depending on what you selected in\nthe previous step, **Schedule charge date** or **Schedule finalization date**.\nLearn more at [Scheduled invoice\nfinalization](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/scheduled-finalization).\n- Optional Expand **Advanced options**, and add [custom\nfields](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/customize#custom-fields). You can also\nchoose whether you want item prices to **Include inclusive tax** or **Exclude\ntax**. To learn more, see [Net prices and\ntaxes](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/taxes#net-price-taxes). Expand\n**Advanced options**, and add [custom\nfields](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/customize#custom-fields).\n- Click **Review invoice** and decide whether you want to include additional\nemails or continue editing. Send the invoice.\n\nIf you automatically charge your customer, they still need to pay the Boleto for\nthe payment to succeed (despite the finalization of the invoice.) Stripe sends\nyour customer an email with a link that they can visit to complete their Boleto\npayment.\n\nCreate an invoice with the Dashboard\n\n## See also\n\n- [How Invoicing works](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/overview)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Boleto](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/boleto)\n- [payment method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods)\n- [Customers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers)\n- [Subscriptions and emails\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/automatic)\n-\n[API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create#create_invoice-collection_method)\n- [Invoicing Plus](https://stripe.com/invoicing/pricing)\n- [subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating)\n- [Customers page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/customers)\n- [Products](https://docs.stripe.com/api/products)\n- [Prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices)\n- [invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout)\n- [Product catalog page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/products)\n- [Invoices overview page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/invoices)\n- [invoice editor](https://dashboard.stripe.com/invoices/create)\n- [tax rate](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax-rates)\n- [coupon](https://dashboard.stripe.com/coupons/create)\n- [Scheduled invoice\nfinalization](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/scheduled-finalization)\n- [custom fields](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/customize#custom-fields)\n- [Net prices and\ntaxes](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/taxes#net-price-taxes)\n- [How Invoicing works](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/overview)",
