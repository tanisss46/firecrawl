Rules allow you to:\n\n- Hide or show a payment method if the order amount is over or under a certain\namount\n- Hide or show a payment method for buyers in certain countries or using certain\ncurrencies\n\n## Payment method rules considerations\n\nNon-card payment methods can help offer improved unit economics compared to\ncards and they often drive higher AOV and conversion rates.\n\nWhen you turn on these payment methods, you might want to apply specific\nbusiness logic to control when payment methods are available to your buyers.\nWith payment method rules, you can apply these insights directly in Dashboard—no\ncode required.\n\nPayment method rules are compatible with Stripe [A/B\nTesting](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/a-b-testing). This allows you to run\nA/B tests using the targeting criteria you select or test additional criteria.\nFor example, you can test the impact of only showing a specific payment method\nwhen the price is greater than a certain dollar amount.\n\n#### Note\n\nPayment method rules won’t apply when a Payment Element, Checkout, or Payment\nLinks integration creates a\n[subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating). For more\ninformation about subscriptions and invoices, see [How subscriptions\nwork](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview).\n\n## Before you begin\n\n- You must use either the Stripe [Payment\nElement](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element),\n[Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout), or [Payment\nLinks](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links).\n- You must use [Dynamic payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/dynamic-payment-methods)\nto enable additional payment methods from the Stripe Dashboard, which won’t\nrequire any code changes.- To set up dynamic payment methods for direct users,\nsee the [payment method\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/dynamic-payment-methods)\nguide.\n- Connect To set up dynamic payment methods for Connect platforms, see\n[Upgrading to dynamic payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dynamic-payment-methods).\n[Set rule\nconditions](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-method-rules#set-rule-conditions)-\nIn your Dashboard, go to [Payment methods\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/payment_methods).\n- In the payment method row, select **Create custom rules**.\n\n![Klarna\nRow](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/pmt-klarna-row.931f50a1bd9a4d872657f0372dead2d8.png)\n- Set custom rules (for example, a new minimum of 100 USD for Klarna), then\nselect **Apply Overrides**. The configured payment method now has a\n**Customized** tag. A customized payment method appears only in Checkout or\nPayment Element sessions that meet its targeting criteria.\n\n![A checkout page showing\nKlarna.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/pmt-checkout-klarna-present.fab9fed6ec4dfc1e187b38beb944fc65.png)\n\nBefore\n\n![A checkout page with Klarna\nhidden.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/pmt-checkout-klarna-hidden.e1d585ab6318861be8aa813cdde91fb4.png)\n\nAfter\n\n## Links\n\n- [A/B Testing](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/a-b-testing)\n- [subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating)\n- [How subscriptions\nwork](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview)\n- [Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element)\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout)\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n- [Dynamic payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/dynamic-payment-methods)\n- [Upgrading to dynamic payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dynamic-payment-methods)\n- [Payment methods\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/payment_methods)",
