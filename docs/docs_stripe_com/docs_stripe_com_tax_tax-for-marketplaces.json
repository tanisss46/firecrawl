The US refers to these businesses as\nmarketplace facilitators, while other regions, such as Europe, might refer to\nthem as deemed sellers.\n\nAs a marketplace operator, your tax collection requirements differ depending on\nthe country or state. However, if your electronic interface enables transactions\nbetween buyers and sellers and you directly or indirectly collect customer\npayments, you might need to fulfill tax collection responsibilities.\n\nIf your businesses operates a marketplace or platform, you must first determine\nwhether they qualify as a marketplace facilitator or a deemed seller, then make\nsure that they maintain tax compliance. If you’re unsure about your business’s\ntax requirements, consult a tax advisor.\n\nIf your business operates a marketplace and wants to collect tax on sales\nfacilitated through this marketplace, refer to details below to enable Stripe\nTax for marketplaces.\n\n## Enable Stripe Tax for marketplaces\n\nStripe Tax enables businesses to calculate, collect, and file indirect taxes in\nover 40 countries, across hundreds of product categories.\n\nUse this guide if your platform is responsible for collecting, filing, and\nreporting taxes.\n\n#### Note\n\nWe use the platform’s head office location, preset tax code, and tax\nregistrations to calculate taxes. However, we don’t use the connected account\ninformation for tax purposes.\n\n- [Configure your platform account for tax\ncollection](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-for-marketplaces#set-up)\n- (Optional) [Assign tax codes to product\ncatalog](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-for-marketplaces#assign-product-tax-codes)\n- [Integrate tax calculation and\ncollection](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-for-marketplaces#enable-tax-collection)\n- [Withhold the collected tax\namount](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-for-marketplaces#tax-withholding)\n- [Access Stripe Tax\nreports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-for-marketplaces#access-reports)\n[Configure your platform account for tax\ncollection](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-for-marketplaces#set-up)\nTo collect taxes, you need the platform account’s tax settings and\nregistrations.\n\n### Use the Stripe Dashboard\n\n### Use the Stripe API\n\n[Assign tax codes to your product\ncatalog](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-for-marketplaces#assign-product-tax-codes)\nTo calculate taxes, Stripe Tax requires that you classify products into tax\ncodes. You can do so by supplying [a preset tax\ncode](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/products-prices-tax-codes-tax-behavior#preset-tax-codes)\nfor the platform account, which might be sufficient if you typically sell a\nsingle category of items or services.\n\nAdditionally, you can [map tax codes to each\nproduct](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/products-prices-tax-codes-tax-behavior#tax-code-on-product)\nto give you more control over tax categorization. You might have to map each\nproduct that a seller sets up on your marketplace. You can find a list of\nsupported tax codes from [available tax\ncodes](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes) or retrieve it from the Stripe\n[Tax Code API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_codes).\n\n[Integrate tax calculation and\ncollection](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-for-marketplaces#enable-tax-collection)\nYou need to integrate with Stripe Tax to estimate taxes as part of your checkout\nflow.\n\n### Payment Links\n\n### Payment Links for one-time payments\n\n### Payment Links for subscriptions\n\n### Checkout\n\n### Checkout Sessions for one-time payments\n\n### Checkout Sessions for subscriptions\n\n### Billing\n\n### Subscriptions\n\n### Invoicing\n\n### Custom flows using the Stripe Tax API\n\n### Payment Intents\n\n### Off-Stripe payments\n\nAfter you implement it, Stripe automatically starts collecting tax in\njurisdictions where you have an active registration.\n\n#### Caution\n\nIndependent of the payment APIs, we credit the transaction amount to the\nconnected account. You need to withhold the collected tax amount on the platform\nbecause the platform is [liable for tax](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/connect).\n\n[Withhold collected tax\namount](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-for-marketplaces#tax-withholding)\nYou must make sure that the tax collected is transferred to your marketplace\naccount, so that you can then remit the tax to relevant jurisdictions.\n\n### Checkout and Payment Links\n\n### Invoicing\n\n### Subscriptions\n\n### Payment Intents with Stripe Tax API\n\n[Access Stripe Tax\nReports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-for-marketplaces#access-reports)\n### Use the Stripe Dashboard\n\n### Use the Stripe API\n\n## See also\n\n- [Calculate tax in your custom checkout\nflow](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/custom)\n\n## Links\n\n- [a preset tax\ncode](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/products-prices-tax-codes-tax-behavior#preset-tax-codes)\n- [map tax codes to each\nproduct](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/products-prices-tax-codes-tax-behavior#tax-code-on-product)\n- [available tax codes](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes)\n- [Tax Code API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_codes)\n- [liable for tax](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/connect)\n- [Calculate tax in your custom checkout\nflow](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/custom)",
