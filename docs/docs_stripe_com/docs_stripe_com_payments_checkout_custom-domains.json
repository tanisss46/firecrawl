Adding custom\ndomains is a paid feature. For information about cost, see Checkout’s\n[Pricing](https://stripe.com/pricing).\n\n[Add your custom domain to the Stripe\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/custom-domains#add-your-custom-domain)\nDecide what subdomain to use with your Checkout Sessions, Payment Links, and\ncustomer portal.\n\n#### Note\n\nIf your domain is `example.com`, we recommend using `payments.example.com` as\nyour custom subdomain. You can replace `payments` with anything you like, as\nlong it’s a valid subdomain. You can’t use a path like `example.com/checkout`\nand must specify a subdomain of your existing domain.\n\nAfter you decide on a subdomain, visit the [Custom domains settings\npage](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/custom-domains) to start the domain\nconnection process.\n\nOn the settings page click **Add your domain**.\n\nIn the pop up, enter your desired subdomain. Click **Add** when you’re done.\nYou’ll see the popup update with instructions for setting up your DNS records.\n\nYour custom domain is activated automatically when your DNS records are\nverified. To disable this behavior, uncheck the **Switch to this domain once\nadded** checkbox.\n\n#### When will my domain be added?\n\nWhen your domain is in the `Adding...` state, we wait to verify your DNS records\nthat you set up in the next step. After Stripe verifies the DNS records, we\ncreate TLS certificates for your subdomain, set up the correct CDN routing, and\nthen your domain is `ready` to enable and use.\n\n[Identify your DNS\nProvider](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/custom-domains#your-dns-provider)\nTo start, figure out what service is managing your DNS records, so you know\nexactly where to login and create the new records.\n\nIf you **already know** your DNS provider, you can move on to the next section.\n\nOften, it’s the same place you registered your domain, but sometimes the DNS\nprovider is different from your domain registrar.\n\nIf you’re not certain who your DNS provider is, try looking up your domain’s\nnameservers, replacing **stripe.com** with your own domain in this command:\n\n```\nnslookup -querytype=NS stripe.com\n```\n\nYou’ll see a list of nameservers for your domain in the output. Here’s some\nexample output for **stripe.com**:\n\n```\n# Looks like AWS is providing our DNS here:\nstripe.com\tnameserver = ns-423.awsdns-52.com.\nstripe.com\tnameserver = ns-705.awsdns-24.net.\nstripe.com\tnameserver = ns-1087.awsdns-07.org.\nstripe.com\tnameserver = ns-1882.awsdns-43.co.uk.\n\n```\n\nIf you’re more comfortable using a browser-based tool, go to [MXLookup’s DNS\nLookup tool](https://mxtoolbox.com/DnsLookup.aspx) and enter your domain. It\nmight be able to tell you who your DNS provider is (but not always).\n\n[Create required DNS\nrecords](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/custom-domains#create-dns-records)\nIn this section, you’ll create the DNS records you need to connect your domain.\nAs you go through each step, check each checkbox to keep track of where you are\nin the process.\n\nSelect the tab that matches your DNS provider from the tabs below—this gives you\nspecific, guided instructions for creating the required DNS records. If your DNS\nprovider isn’t an option, follow the Standard instructions:\n\nStandard instructionsGoDaddyCloudflare\nThese are standard instructions for creating your DNS records. If you have\nissues with any of the steps, please contact your DNS provider for more\nassistance.\n\n#### Note\n\nTo track your progress, go through each step and check it off when you’ve\ncompleted it.\n\n- Sign into your DNS provider\nMost DNS providers have a control panel you can sign into to manage your DNS.\nFind your provider’s control panel page and sign in.\n- Find the page to manage the DNS for your domain\nNow that you’re logged in, find where you can manage the DNS records for your\ndomain in your provider’s control panel.\n\nIf you’re having issues finding the right page, you can:\n\n- See if your DNS provider has a help article for adding new DNS records that\ncan point you in the right direction.\n- Contact your DNS provider for additional support.\n- Create your CNAME record\nFrom your DNS control panel, add a new record that maps your desired subdomain\nto Checkout. Most DNS providers ask you for the record type, name, value, and\nTTL or expiration when creating a new record.\n\n#### Note\n\nThis record is what connects your subdomain to Stripe Checkout.\n\nEnter these values and save the new DNS record:\n\nFieldInstructionsDescriptionTypeSelect `CNAME` from the dropdownWhat kind of DNS\nrecord this is.Name\nIf your custom subdomain is **checkout.powdur.me**, enter `checkout`\n\nFor CNAME records, this field is the first part of your subdomain (the part\nleading up to the first period).\n**Value**\n\nEnter `hosted-checkout.stripecdn.com`\n\nThis is what the new subdomain record points to–in this case, Stripe.\n\nSome providers may expect a trailing period (`.`) after the CNAME value. Make\nsure to verify that your CNAME value matches the format your provider expects.\n\nTTL/ExpiryEnter `300`An expiration of 5 minutes (300 seconds) is OK. Your DNS\nprovider might not allow you to change the TTL value. If this field is missing\nor you can’t change it, it’s safe to ignore this part of the configuration.\n- Create your TXT record\nFrom your DNS control panel, add a new TXT record.\n\n#### Note\n\nThis TXT record lets us verify that you’re the owner of this domain. This is\nrequired to issue TLS certificates for your domain, so you can continue to\naccept payments securely.\n\nEnter these values and save the new DNS record:\n\nFieldInstructionsDescriptionTypeSelect `TXT` from the dropdownWhat kind of DNS\nrecord this is.Name\nIf your custom domain is **checkout.powdur.me**, enter\n`_acme-challenge.checkout`\n\nFor TXT records, this field is the subdomain portion of your domain.Value\nVisit the [Dashboard\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/custom-domains) and click **View\ninstructions** to copy the correct TXT value record.\n\nThis is a long, unique string used for domain verification.TTL/ExpiryEnter\n`300`An expiration of 5 minutes (300 seconds) is OK. Your DNS provider might not\nallow you to change the TTL value. If this field is missing or you can’t change\nit, it’s safe to ignore this part of the configuration.\n- Verify your CNAME record is setup\nAfter you save your DNS record, verify that it has the correct values.\n\nVerify in your terminalVerify with your web browser- Wait up to 10 minutes for\nyour DNS provider to update its nameservers.\n- Replace **checkout.powdur.me** with your custom domain in the following\ncommand and run it from your terminal:\n\n```\nnslookup -querytype=CNAME checkout.powdur.me\n```\n\nYou should see output like:\n\n```\n<your subdomain> \tcanonical name = hosted-checkout.stripecdn.com.\n\n```\n\nWhen you see that output, move onto the next step.\n- Verify your TXT record\nAfter you save your DNS record, verify that it has the correct values.\n\nVerify in your terminalVerify with your web browser- Wait up to 10 minutes for\nyour DNS provider to update its nameservers.\n- Replace **checkout.powdur.me** with your custom domain in the following\ncommand and run it from your terminal:\n\n```\nnslookup -querytype=TXT _acme-challenge.checkout.powdur.me\n```\n\nYou should see output like this:\n\n```\n_acme-challenge.<your domain> text = \"<your unique TXT record value>\"\n\n```\n\nIf you don’t see your unique TXT record value in the output, wait a bit longer\nand try running the command again.\n\nWhen you finish this step, your DNS records are configured.\n\nNow that you’ve created your DNS records and verified them, Stripe verifies the\nconnection and provisions your domain on our end. We’ll send you an email and a\nDashboard notification when the domain is ready for you to enable it. You can\nalso visit the [Dashboard\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/custom-domains) at any time to\nsee the current status of your custom domain connection.\n\n[OptionalTest your custom\ndomain](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/custom-domains#test-your-domain)[OptionalRemoving\nyour custom\ndomain](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/custom-domains#removing-your-domain)[OptionalUsing\ncustom domains with\nConnect](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/custom-domains#connect)[OptionalTroubleshooting\nyour\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/custom-domains#troubleshooting-integration)[OptionalTroubleshooting\nCAA DNS\nrecords](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/custom-domains#troubleshooting-caa-records)[OptionalTroubleshooting\na blocked\ndomain](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/custom-domains#troubleshooting-a-blocked-domain)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Stripe-hosted\npage](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web&ui=stripe-hosted)\n- [Pricing](https://stripe.com/pricing)\n- [Custom domains settings\npage](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/custom-domains)\n- [MXLookup’s DNS Lookup tool](https://mxtoolbox.com/DnsLookup.aspx)",
