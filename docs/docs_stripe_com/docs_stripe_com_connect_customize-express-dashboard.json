It displays an **Activity** feed, an **Earnings** chart, and your\nplatform’s brand name and icon. Learn how to customize the Express Dashboard for\nyour users in this guide.\n\nTo learn more about each feature in the Express Dashboard, see [Express\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/express-dashboard).\n\n[Add your platform's brand name and\nicon](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/customize-express-dashboard#add-platform-branding)\nYou can display your platform’s brand name, icon, and customize theming in the\nExpress Dashboard.\n\nAccess your [Express branding\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/express-dashboard/branding),\nenter your platform’s `business_name`, upload your platform’s icon, and\ncustomize your theming settings. When satisfied with the preview, save your\nchanges. If you already saved your brand information before reading this guide,\nskip this step.\n\n[Set custom descriptions for charges and\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/customize-express-dashboard#set-custom-descriptions)\nBy default, the **Transactions** list on the Express Dashboard displays generic\ndescriptions for charges and transfers (for example: `Payment on\n{YOUR_PLATFORM}`).\n\nFirst, determine which type of charge your platform uses. The two recommended\ncharge types for Express connected accounts are [Destination\nCharges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges#destination) and [Separate\nCharges and\nTransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges#separate-charges-transfers).\n\nAfter you determine the charge type, use the following instructions to update\nyour integration.\n\n### Destination charges\n\nTo update the\n[description](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-description)\non a payment object that’s visible to your platform’s users, you need to use the\nStripe API. This applies to all platforms that use [destination\ncharges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges).\n\n- Find the existing transfer object you created for an account by finding the\nlatest\n[charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-charges)\ncreated on the\n[PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object).\n- Use the charge object to find the\n[transfer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-transfer)\nobject associated with the charge.\n- Use the transfer object to find the\n[destination_payment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers/object#transfer_object-destination_payment)\nID that exists on the transfer.\n- Call the [Update Charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/update) API to\nupdate the\n[description](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/update#update_charge-description)\non the destination payment using the `destination_payment` ID.\n\n#### Note\n\nThe\n[destination_payment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers/object#transfer_object-destination_payment)\nobject belongs to the connected account, so you’ll need to set [the\nStripe-Account header](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/authentication) to the\nconnected account’s ID to make this call.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/charges/{{PAYMENT_ID}} \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -H \"Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}\" \\\n -d description=\"My custom description\"\n```\n\nThis description becomes visible on the charge after you’ve written this field.\n\nLearn more about [creating destination charges on your\nplatform](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges).\n\n### Separate charges and transfers\n\nTo update the\n[description](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-description)\non a payment object that’s visible to your platform’s users, you need to use the\nStripe API. This applies to platforms that use [separate charges and\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers).\n\n- Use the transfer object to find the\n[destination_payment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers/object#transfer_object-destination_payment)\nID that exists on the transfer.\n- Call the [Update Charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/update) API to\nupdate the\n[description](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/update#update_charge-description)\non the destination payment using the `destination_payment` ID found in the\nprevious step.\n\n#### Note\n\nThe\n[destination_payment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers/object#transfer_object-destination_payment)\nobject belongs to the connected account, so you’ll need to set [the\nStripe-Account header](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/authentication) to the\nconnected account’s ID to make this call.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/charges/{{PAYMENT_ID}} \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -H \"Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}\" \\\n -d description=\"My custom description\"\n```\n\nThis description becomes visible on the charge after you’ve written this field.\n\nLearn more about [creating separate charges and\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers).\n\n## See also\n\n- [Collect payments and then pay\nout](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/collect-then-transfer-guide) (if you\nprocess payments with Stripe)\n- [Pay out money](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/add-and-pay-out-guide) (if you\nadd money from a bank account to pay out)\n\n## Links\n\n- [payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts)\n- [Express Dashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/express-dashboard)\n- [Express branding\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/express-dashboard/branding)\n- [Destination Charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges#destination)\n- [Separate Charges and\nTransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges#separate-charges-transfers)\n-\n[description](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-description)\n- [destination charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges)\n-\n[charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-charges)\n- [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object)\n- [transfer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-transfer)\n-\n[destination_payment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers/object#transfer_object-destination_payment)\n- [Update Charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/update)\n-\n[description](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/update#update_charge-description)\n- [the Stripe-Account header](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/authentication)\n- [separate charges and\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n- [Collect payments and then pay\nout](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/collect-then-transfer-guide)\n- [Pay out money](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/add-and-pay-out-guide)",
