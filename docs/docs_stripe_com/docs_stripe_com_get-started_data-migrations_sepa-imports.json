  "content": "# Import SEPA Data\n\nStripe migrates all SEPA payment data as payment methods. This guide provides\ninstructions for migrating your existing SEPA mandates from your previous\npayment processors into Stripe.\n\n## Importing the mandates\n\nIn the context of SEPA, mandates refer to the original authorized agreement that\nthe customer and the business have already established.\n\nIn Stripe, *creating a new mandate object* doesn’t mean creating a new mandate\nfrom scratch. On import, we create a new *mandate object* that:\n\n- Uses the same `mandate_reference` as your original agreement.\n- Represents the same agreement the customer initially authorized for the first\ndirect debit instruction.\n\nNo new information is required from the customer. The original agreement stays\nthe same.\n\n### Creditor ID\n\nA SEPA Creditor Identifier (Creditor ID) is an ID associated with each SEPA\nDirect Debit payment that identifies the company requesting the payment. While\ncompanies might have multiple creditor identifiers, each creditor identifier is\nunique and allows your customers to identify the debits on their account.\n\nBy default, your Stripe account uses a Stripe Creditor ID when collecting SEPA\nDirect Debit Payments. **Stripe Payments** appears on bank statements alongside\nyour configurable [Stripe statement\ndescriptor](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/statement-descriptors).\nWe recommend that you:\n\n- Configure a recognizable statement descriptor to make sure customers recognize\npayments and to reduce the risk of disputes.\n- Use your own Creditor ID to reduce dispute rates and improve your customer’s\nrecognition of their payment to you.\n- If you’re using the Stripe Creditor ID, use Stripe Checkout to collect\nmandates from your customers for SEPA Direct Debits.\n\nYou can configure your own Creditor ID in the [Payment Method\nSettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) page. When\nusing your own Creditor ID, your name appears on statements instead of Stripe’s.\n\n#### Example SEPA Bank Mandate if using Stripe’s Creditor ID\n\n```\nFrom Account\nAccount name: CURRENT-ACCOUNT\nBIC: BANBICKIEXXXXX\nIBAN: IE11BANK11111111111111\n\nOriginator Details\nOriginator name: Stripe Payments Europe Ltd\nCreditor Identifier: BE111111111111\nThe Creditor Identifier is a unique identifier used by\nthe company to process collections.\n\nUMR: UMR123 PSP\nThe Unique Mandate Reference (UMR) is specific to the\nmandate you have signed and identifies each direct\ndebit mandate.\n\nAdditional details\nStatus: Active\n\n```\n\n#### Example SEPA Bank Mandate if using your own Creditor ID\n\n```\nFrom Account\nAccount name: CURRENT-ACCOUNT\nBIC: BANBICKIEXXXXX\nIBAN: IE11BANK11111111111111\n\nOriginator Details\nOriginator name: Merchant Creditor ID Name\nCreditor Identifier: BE222222222222\nThe Creditor Identifier is a unique identifier used by\nthe company to process collections.\n\nUMR: UMR123 PSP\nThe Unique Mandate Reference (UMR) is specific to the\nmandate you have signed and identifies each direct\ndebit mandate.\n\nAdditional details\nStatus: Active\n\n```\n\n## Migration notification\n\nInform your customers about the migration before it happens. They don’t need to\ngive permission again or set up a new SEPA Direct Debit mandate. The approval\nyou already have is sufficient.\n\n### General guidelines for communication:\n\nPoint out any changes such as:\n\n- Creditor ID if you opt for Stripe’s Creditor ID\n- Creditor name if you opt for Stripe’s Creditor ID\n- Recipient bank IBAN\n\nMake sure the communication reassures customers their current mandates are valid\nwithout requiring any action from them, unless they choose to cancel the\nmandate.\n\n## SEPA debit notification\n\nSEPA rules state that you must [notify your\ncustomers](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sepa-debit#debit-notification-emails)\nwhen debiting their SEPA payment method.\n\nBy default, Stripe automatically sends these email notifications on your behalf.\n\n## SEPA file guidance\n\n- A processor can provide a number of different fields.\n- We advise your processor to provide a full export of all customer and payment\nmethod data to Stripe.\n- Stripe can filter out any unnecessary fields from the previous processor’s\ndata as needed.\n- Stripe can merge multiple received files if either the old customer ID or the\nold source ID is present in both files.\n\n### File formatting requirements\n\nExport data files must meet the following data standards for us to proceed with\nan import:\n\n- The file must be in CSV format.\n- The file must be UTF-8 encoded.\n- Delimit rows by a single newline character `\n` (not `\\r\n`).\n- Delimit columns by a comma (`,`).\n- You must wrap all fields containing commas in double quotes (`\"`). We\nrecommend wrapping all fields in double quotes.\n- Leave empty fields entirely empty (no character in between delimiters). You\nmust *not* denote a missing field with `NULL`, `N/A`, or any other value.\n- Escape any double quotes that are part of the content with another double\nquote per the CSV RFC. Example: `\"``William` `\"\"``Bard of Avon``\"\"`\n`Shakespeare``\"`\n- Fields can’t contain newline characters (`\\r` or `\n`) within a field. An example of what to avoid would be: `101 1st Ave\nApt 1`.\n- All rows must have the same number of columns.\n- Columns support any order.\n- You must encrypt sensitive data files with our [PGP\nkey](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/data-migrations/pan-import#migration-pgp-key)\nbefore submitting them through SFTP.\n\n### SEPA data Fields\n\nFieldRequiredAdditional infoOld customer IDRequiredWe create a customer ID for\neach unique old customer ID provided.NameRequiredWe must include the name of the\nperson on the mandate.IBANRequiredFollow Stripe’s valid IBAN structure.Mandate\nreferenceRequiredExisting mandate reference IDEmailRequiredSEPA requires you to\nemail a notification to the customer upon debiting their SEPA payment method.\nStripe can send this email notification automatically or you can manually send\nit.Address line 1Required**Mandatory for non EU IBANsCountryRequired**Mandatory\nfor non EU IBANs.
