Use an\nin-person card to initiate an online\n[subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating) using\n[Billing](https://docs.stripe.com/billing), save payment details to a customer’s\nonline account, or defer payment.\n\n## Collect and save reusable card details\n\nYou can collect reusable card details and save them for online use with\nTerminal:\n\n- [Directly, without charging the\ncard](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/saving-cards/save-cards-directly)\n- [After\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/saving-cards/save-after-payment)\n\n## Create a reusable PaymentMethod\n\nWhen you create a PaymentIntent or SetupIntent with a card-present payment\nmethod, you can’t save the PaymentMethod directly. However, in most cases,\nStripe can create a reusable `generated_card` PaymentMethod using the card\ninformation. It represents the same payment method and can be reused for online\npayments.\n\n## Charge a saved card\n\nYou can charge customers at a later date using card details that were saved\nduring an earlier transaction.\n\nTo charge a saved card for future purchases, [create and confirm a\nPaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-payment_method)\nwith the saved payment method.\n\nTo [save a card from a Terminal\nPaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/saving-cards/save-after-payment),\nattach the `generated_card` PaymentMethod to a Customer. This allows you to\nreuse it without having to collect payment details again. If you attach a\nPaymentMethod to a PaymentIntent without also attaching the PaymentMethod to a\nCustomer, you won’t be able to reuse the Payment Method in future transactions.\n\n## Charge customers outside the checkout flow\n\nIf the customer isn’t in your checkout flow when you charge the customer, set\n[off_session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/confirm#confirm_payment_intent-off_session)\nto `true`. This causes the PaymentIntent to throw an error if customer\nauthentication is required.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents \\\n -u sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2: \\\n -d \"payment_method_types[]\"=\"card\" \\\n -d \"amount\"=1099 \\\n -d \"currency\"=\"usd\" \\\n -d \"customer\"=\"{{CUSTOMER_ID}}\" \\\n -d \"payment_method\"=\"{{PAYMENT_METHOD_ID}}\"\n```\n\nWhen charging a saved card, you can’t use the\n[confirmPaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/collect-card-payment#confirm-payment)\nmethod. Payments with generated cards are online payments and can’t be processed\nwith Terminal SDK methods.\n\n## Track customer behavior with card fingerprints\n\nUse the Stripe API to recognize repeat customers across online and retail\nchannels by correlating transactions by the same card. Like `card` payment\nmethods, each `card_present` payment method has a\n[fingerprint](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object#payment_method_object-card-fingerprint)\nattribute that uniquely identifies a particular card number. Cards from [mobile\nwallets](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/wallets) (for example, Apple Pay or\nGoogle Pay) don’t share a fingerprint with cards used online.\n\nStarting with [API version\n2018-01-23](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#2018-01-23), Connect platforms see\na fingerprint on `card_present` and `card` PaymentMethods that’s uniform across\nall connected accounts. You can use this fingerprint to look up a specific\ncard’s charges in a connected account.\n\n## Compliance\n\nYou’re responsible for your compliance with all applicable laws, regulations,\nand network rules when saving a customer’s payment details. For example, the\nEuropean Data Protection Board has issued guidance regarding saving payment\ndetails. These requirements generally apply if you want to save your customer’s\npayment method for future use, such as presenting a customer’s payment method to\nthem in the checkout flow for a future purchase or charging them when they’re\nnot actively using your website or app.\n\nAdd terms to your website or app that state how you plan to save payment method\ndetails and allow customers to opt in. If you plan to charge the customer while\nthey’re offline, then at a minimum, make sure that your terms also cover the\nfollowing:\n\n- The customer’s agreement to your initiating a payment or a series of payments\non their behalf for specified transactions.\n- The anticipated timing and frequency of payments (for instance, whether\ncharges are for scheduled installment or subscription payments, or for\nunscheduled top-ups).\n- How the payment amount is determined.\n- Your cancellation policy, if you’re setting up the payment method for a\nsubscription service.\n\nMake sure you keep a record of your customer’s written agreement to these terms.\n\nWhen you save a payment method, it can only be used for the specific usage that\nyou included in your terms. If you want to charge customers when they’re offline\nand also save the customer’s payment method to present to them as a saved\npayment method for future purchases, you must explicitly collect consent from\nthe customer. One way to do so is with a “Save my payment method for future use”\ncheckbox.\n\n## Links\n\n- [payment methods](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods)\n- [mobile wallets](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/wallets)\n- [subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating)\n- [Billing](https://docs.stripe.com/billing)\n- [Directly, without charging the\ncard](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/saving-cards/save-cards-directly)\n- [After\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/saving-cards/save-after-payment)\n- [create and confirm a\nPaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-payment_method)\n-\n[off_session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/confirm#confirm_payment_intent-off_session)\n-\n[confirmPaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/collect-card-payment#confirm-payment)\n-\n[fingerprint](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object#payment_method_object-card-fingerprint)\n- [API version 2018-01-23](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#2018-01-23)",
