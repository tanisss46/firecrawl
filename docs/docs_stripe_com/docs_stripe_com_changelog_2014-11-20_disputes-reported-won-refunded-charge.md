# Disputes are now reported as won even if the charge is refundedBreaking changes

## What’s new

Updates disputes that are won to return the status `won` even if the charge was
refunded. Previously, a dispute won that had a refunded charge would transition
to `charge_refunded`.

## Impact

A dispute’s `won` status now persists even if the charge was refunded, providing
more accurate dispute resolution tracking.
