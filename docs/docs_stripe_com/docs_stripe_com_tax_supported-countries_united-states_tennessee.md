# Collect tax in Tennessee

## Learn how to use Stripe Tax to calculate, collect, and report tax in Tennessee.

## When to register for tax collection

See [Thresholds](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/thresholds) to get insights
about your potential tax registration obligations in Tennessee. Stripe also
notifies you with email and Dashboard alerts when you need to register to
collect tax. Learn more about how the [monitoring tool
works](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/monitoring).

Remote sellers must register to collect and remit tax in Tennessee when, in the
prior twelve months, they exceed a sales threshold of 100,000 USD.

The threshold includes retail sales, whether taxable or nontaxable. The
threshold excludes wholesale sales (sales for resale) and marketplace sales.

## Register to collect tax

Register for sales tax in Tennessee at the [tax
authority](https://www.tn.gov/revenue/taxes/sales-and-use-tax.html). Read more
about registering for [sales tax in the US in our
guide](https://stripe.com/guides/sales-tax-registration-process-us).

After you’ve registered to collect tax in Tennessee, go to
[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations?location=us-tn)
to add your registrations to Stripe in the Dashboard. This turns on tax
calculation and collection in Stripe for your transactions in Tennessee.

Learn [how to add your
registration](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/registering#track-your-registrations-in-the-tax-dashboard)
in the Dashboard.

## How we calculate taxes

If your [origin address](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/set-up#origin-address) is
in the US and differs from your customer’s state, Stripe always calculates tax
based on your customer’s location.

If your customer is in Tennessee and your origin address is also in Tennessee,
Stripe applies tax based on your origin address, depending on the type of
product or service you sell.

## Report and file your taxes

Stripe provides reports of your completed tax transactions. Go to
[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations) to access these
reports.

### Exports

The tax transaction data export provides a comprehensive and aggregated view of
transactions by location, including a breakdown of individual tax amounts. Learn
more about [tax reporting exports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports#exports).

### Location reports

[Location reports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports#us-location-reports)
offer a summary of transaction and refund data for specific US locations and
align with Tennessee filing requirements. You have the option to report on an
annual, fiscal year, quarterly, or monthly basis.

Reporting-specific considerations:

- In most areas of Tennessee, if the price of a single item exceeds the local
tax limit for that specific area, the local tax doesn’t apply to that excess
amount. You won’t see a location report for Tennessee if you have these
transactions. Use the [exports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports#exports)
instead for a detailed tax breakdown of each transaction.

### Filing

Stripe Tax has filing partners—Taxually, Marosa, and Hands-off Sales Tax
(HOST)—to help automate your tax filing. These partners automatically sync your
tax transaction data in real time, eliminating the need for manual data entry or
file transfers. Learn more about [tax
filing](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/filing).
