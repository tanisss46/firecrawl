The Address Element is an embeddable UI component for accepting complete
addresses. Use it to collect shipping addresses, or when you need a complete
billing address, such as for tax purposes.

Features include:

- **Global support**: Support 236 regional address formats, including
right-to-left address formats
- **Autocomplete**: Decrease checkout time, reduce validation errors, and
increase checkout conversion with built-in address autocomplete
- **Prefill saved addresses**: Prefill addresses at page load when you already
have an address saved for your customer
- **Customized appearance**: Customize the Address Element to match your page
design with the [Appearance
API](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/appearance-api)
- **Seamless Elements integration**: Reuse an existing Elements instance to save
time, and pass data automatically with the Payment Element and Link
- **Support for any device**: Available for web, iOS, Android, and React Native
mobile SDKs
