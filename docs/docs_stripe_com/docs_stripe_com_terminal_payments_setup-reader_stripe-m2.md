# Set up Stripe Reader M2

## Learn how to set up the Stripe Reader M2.

Stripe Reader M2 is a small reader that you can use with mobile applications. It
uses Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) or USB (Android only) to
[connect](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/connect-reader) to the
Stripe Terminal SDK on a mobile device.

This reader is compatible with our iOS, Android, and React Native SDKs. To view
the reader’s parts and features, see the [Stripe Reader M2 product
sheet](https://d37ugbyn3rpeym.cloudfront.net/terminal/product-sheets/m2_product_sheet.pdf).

#### Warning

Stripe readers aren’t liquid-proof and we recommend that users make appropriate
efforts to make sure their devices remain dry. If your device has experienced
liquid ingress, we recommend that you stop using the device and let it dry
thoroughly before attempting to re-use or charge the device. If your device
doesn’t properly operate or charge properly after drying, you need to replace
it.

## Availability

The Stripe Reader M2 is available in all 50 US states and Puerto Rico.

## Turn the reader on and off

Turn on the Stripe Reader M2 by pressing and releasing the power button. The
status LEDs turn on for 2 seconds and the reader beeps twice. The reader waits
for a Bluetooth connection for five minutes before turning off.

When the reader [connects to a device running your
app](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/connect-reader?reader-type=bluetooth),
the status LEDs on top of the reader flash four times. After connecting, the
first status light begins flashing at five second intervals. The reader stays
connected to your iOS or Android device while in standby mode and automatically
exits standby mode when you resume activity.

When connected, the reader automatically turns off after 10 hours of inactivity.
You can turn off the reader manually by pressing and holding the power button
for four seconds. You don’t need to turn off the reader to conserve power. When
the reader turns off, the four LEDs light up and then turn off one by one to
indicate it has turned off.

#### Note

With typical usage, you only need to [charge the
reader](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/setup-reader/stripe-m2#charging)
fully once per day.

## Charge the reader

To charge the Stripe Reader M2, use the included cable or a USB 2.0 cable.

## Check the battery status

When the Stripe Reader M2 is on, you can press and release the power button once
to check the battery level. The LEDs on top of the reader show the current
status.
