The information can come from their Stripe user account or\nfrom an existing connected account that they own. They don’t have to resubmit\nthat information or repeat related Know Your Customer (KYC) processes.\n\nSome shared information remains synchronized between accounts. If the account\nowner updates it on one account, the update automatically applies to all shared\naccounts.\n\n## Use Case Example\n\nEmma, an artisan jeweler, has been selling her wares through a personal website\nthat accepts payments using Stripe Checkout. Looking to expand her business, she\ndiscovers an online marketplace called Artisan Market and decides to sign up.\nArtisan Market is a Stripe Connect platform.\n\nBecause Emma is the sole proprietor for both her website and her new marketplace\nventure, they share the same legal entity information. When Emma onboards her\nconnected account for Artisan Market, Legal Entity Sharing lets her reuse some\nof the information she provided when setting up payments for her website. She\ndoesn’t have to resubmit documentation for that information.\n\nThe wider exposure increases Emma’s sales, and she decides to expand by moving\nher business from her home studio to a dedicated workshop in a commercial\nbuilding. Because Legal Entity Sharing synchronizes company address information\nbetween shared accounts, Emma only needs to update the business address on one\nof her accounts. Legal Entity Sharing automatically updates the address on the\nother account.\n\n## Availability\n\nLegal Entity Sharing is available for accounts where Stripe is responsible for\ncollecting requirements (the account’s\n[controller.requirement_collection](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-controller-requirement_collection)\nis `stripe`).\n\nFor accounts where\n[controller.requirement_collection](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-controller-requirement_collection)\nis `platform`, including Custom accounts, the account owner can copy some\nexisting account information during onboarding. However, sharing doesn’t apply\nto future updates. Each account must be updated individually.\n\nIf the platform has requested any\n[capabilities](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-capabilities)\nfor the new account, the owner can only share information from accounts in the\nsame country as the new account. Otherwise, they can share information from any\nof their existing accounts.\n\n[Stripe-hosted](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/hosted-onboarding) and\n[embedded](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/embedded-onboarding) onboarding flows\nsupport Legal Entity Sharing. However, embedded onboarding flows require [Stripe\nuser\nauthentication](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components?platform=web#user-authentication-in-connect-embedded-components).\nIf you set\n[disable_stripe_user_authentication](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions/create#create_account_session-components-account_onboarding-features-disable_stripe_user_authentication)\nto true, your embedded onboarding flow can’t use Legal Entity Sharing.\n\nAPI based onboarding flows can’t use Legal Entity Sharing.\n\nWhen a legal entity is shared between accounts, some information is synchronized\nbetween shared accounts. If the account owner changes that information on one\naccount, the changes automatically apply to all shared accounts. Other\ninformation can be copied from existing accounts during onboarding, but future\nupdates to it aren’t synchronized.\n\n#### Note\n\nDuring onboarding, Stripe offers Legal Entity Sharing if the authenticated\naccount owner has any existing accounts. The owner can select an existing\naccount to share information with the new account, or they can choose to set up\nthe new account from scratch. If they set up the new account from scratch, they\ncan’t share it with existing accounts later. However, they can select it to\nshare information when onboarding new accounts.\n\nLegal Entity Sharing shares the following information between\n[Accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object), and updates on one\naccount automatically apply to shared accounts:\n\n-\n[business_type](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-business_type)\n- [country](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-country)\n- [company](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-company)\n-\n[individual](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-individual)\n\nLegal Entity Sharing copies the following information from an existing account\nduring onboarding. However, future updates to this information aren’t\nautomatically copied to shared accounts:\n\n-\n[external_accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-external_accounts)\n-\n[business_profile](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-business_profile)\n-\n[settings.payments.statement_descriptor](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-settings-payments-statement_descriptor)\n-\n[settings.card_payments.statement_descriptor_prefix](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-settings-card_payments-statement_descriptor_prefix)\n-\n[settings.branding](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-settings-branding)\n\n## Manage access\n\nIf you don’t want to offer this feature to your connected accounts during\nonboarding, you can disable it from your\n[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/onboarding-options/le-sharing).\n\nDisabling Legal Entity Sharing doesn’t affect existing accounts that already use\nthe feature. It only hides the feature from new connected accounts.\n\n## Links\n\n-\n[controller.requirement_collection](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-controller-requirement_collection)\n-\n[capabilities](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-capabilities)\n- [Stripe-hosted](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/hosted-onboarding)\n- [embedded](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/embedded-onboarding)\n- [Stripe user\nauthentication](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components?platform=web#user-authentication-in-connect-embedded-components)\n-\n[disable_stripe_user_authentication](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions/create#create_account_session-components-account_onboarding-features-disable_stripe_user_authentication)\n- [Accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object)\n-\n[business_type](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-business_type)\n- [country](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-country)\n- [company](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-company)\n-\n[individual](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-individual)\n-\n[external_accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-external_accounts)\n-\n[business_profile](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-business_profile)\n-\n[settings.payments.statement_descriptor](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-settings-payments-statement_descriptor)\n-\n[settings.card_payments.statement_descriptor_prefix](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-settings-card_payments-statement_descriptor_prefix)\n-\n[settings.branding](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-settings-branding)\n-\n[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/onboarding-options/le-sharing)",
