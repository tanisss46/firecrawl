You can begin filing forms on January\n15.- When you press ‘File’ Stripe files any forms in a ‘Ready’ or ‘Ready!’\nstate.- If you have forms in a ‘Needs Attention’ state and wish to file them,\nyou need to [explicitly update the filing\nrequirement](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/modify-tax-forms?method=csv#tax-form-status)\nfor these forms before filing.\n- Stripe e-delivers or postmarks tax forms for postal delivery by January 31.\n- After February 14, payee identity updates (name, TIN, address) stop flowing\nonto the 1099 tax forms that haven’t been filed yet. This doesn’t impact forms\nthat you already filed by February 14.\n\n## Set tax form default settings\n\nTo configure the settings for tax forms in your account you must log in as the\naccount owner. If you use a team, any user that has the Administrator user role\nfor your account can configure settings. To get started with generating your tax\nforms for 2024, open the [Tax\nreporting](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/taxes/forms) page of the\nDashboard, and then click **Get started**.\n\n![Tax dashboard with the get started button\nhighlighted.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/tax-net-new-user-landing-experience.6ed30557253b2ce8785af2deff182a8b.png)\n\nChoose the default tax form to generate for your connected accounts, the\n[calculation method](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/calculation-methods) to use\nfor your tax form totals, the type of filer for your business, and the kind of\ntransactions you process. We recommend that you use a tax advisor to determine\nwhich options are right for your business. You can change almost all [tax form\nsettings](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/tax-form-settings) at any time for the\nforms that you haven’t filed.\n\n![Select a form type\nscreen.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/tax-form-settings-step.9fdf3acbf457f95499c2bdaa81ce7c2c.png)\n\nSelect a form type\n\n![Tax calculation\nscreen.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/tax-form-settings-step1.a54d8be2498440b91e4229e8426424a6.png)\n\nSelect tax calculation\n\n![Type of filer\nscreen](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/tax-form-settings-step2.dd51a20dca664351848d6b48572ef368.png)\n\nSelect type of filer\n\n![Transaction\nscreen.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/tax-form-settings-step3.5c7890ebc89925cd89092b3fc3c0db9c.png)\n\nSelect types of transactions processed\n\nNext, confirm the business information that displays as the **Payer details** on\nall of your tax forms. Make any necessary changes, then click **Continue**.\n\n![Business information\nscreen.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/tax-business-info-step.56acf3720225276598592dffe50c9f34.png)\n\nNext, add state registration or withholding IDs for the states you plan to file\nwith. You can enter these at any time in the future through [tax form\nsettings](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/tax-form-settings). If you intend to\nfile in either Delaware and Pennsylvania, include your state IDs during this\nstep to prevent possible rejection of your filings.\n\n![State filing\nscreen.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/tax-state-filing-step.200b96a91d14dd22795110ac6865399e.png)\n\nThe next step involves choosing your delivery preferences to meet IRS\nobligations around delivering 1099 forms to payees. We offer two forms of\n[delivery](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/deliver-tax-forms):\n\n- *E-delivery through an interface built by Stripe:* Owners of eligible\nconnected accounts receive an electronic copy of the 1099 form through their\nStripe interface. If the connected account previously did not have access to a\nStripe interface, the Stripe Express Dashboard or Stripe Embedded Components may\nbe used. Stripe sends an email invite to the connected account owners to confirm\ntheir tax details, collect their consent, and provide access to the electronic\ncopy of the form. Read more about [how e-delivery\nworks](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/express-dashboard-taxes).\n- *Paper delivery through postal mail:* Stripe delivers the 1099 forms to the\nowners of eligible connected accounts through postal mail based on the address\non the tax form. If e-delivery is enabled, but the connected account hasn’t\nprovided e-delivery consent at the time of filing, we fall back on postal\ndelivery to meet IRS obligations.\n\n![Delivery method selection\nscreen.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/tax-delivery-preferences-step.e03e2f98406615c5283791f913689dc7.png)\n\nAs a final step, you can view a summary of your tax form settings to confirm\nyour choices. After you confirm your settings, the tax forms dashboard opens,\nwhere you can view all of your tax forms for 2024.\n\n![Summary\nscreen.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/tax-summary-step.5bdede405d7cfef3c01442f44794bd0a.png)\n\n## View and filter tax forms\n\nYou can view all of the tax forms for your connected account using the [Tax\nreporting](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/taxes/forms) dashboard. Click\nthe appropriate tab to filter the forms displayed. To display the **State filing\nstatus**, **Federal filing status**, or **Delivery filing status** instead of\n**Overall filing status**, click the gear icon to the right of the column\nheading and select the status to display.\n\n![Tax reporting page of the\nDashboard](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/tax_reporting_dashboard_new.c5898c0728da3cc9b274a72c2dd13229.png)\n\nYou can apply any of the existing filters to limit the results to only those\nrecords that match the filter criteria. For example, to display only records for\na specific payee, choose the Payee name filter and then enter all or part of a\nname to match. The records displayed include only the records for payees with\nPayee names that match the string you used for the filter.\n\nYou can use the following filters to display tax forms:\n\nFilter nameFilter valuesTypeType of tax form: 1099-K, 1099-MISC, or\n1099-NECOverall filing statusOverall status of tax form: Will not file, Needs\nattention, Ready, Filing, Accepted, or RejectedFederal filing statusStatus of\nthe Federal tax form: Will not file, Needs attention, Ready, Filing, Accepted,\nor RejectedState filing statusStatus of the State tax form: Will not file, Needs\nattention, Ready, Filing, Accepted, or RejectedDelivery statusDelivery status of\nthe tax form: Will not deliver, Needs attention, Ready, Scheduled, Delivering,\nDelivered, FailedPostal delivery statusPostal delivery status of the tax form:\nWill not deliver, Needs attention, Ready, Scheduled, Delivering, Delivered,\nFailedElectronic delivery statusElectronic delivery status of the tax form: Will\nnot deliver, Needs attention, Ready, Scheduled, Delivering, Delivered,\nFailedPre-filing confirmation statusStatus of Stripe’s pre-filing outreach: Not\neligible, Queued, SentStripe merchant IDTax forms for the specified merchant\nIDForms grouped withTax forms grouped with the specified tax form IDPayee\nnameTax forms for the payeePayee stateTax forms for the payee’s stateNeeds\nattentionNeeds attention status: Any reason, Address, Business name, TIN - Any\nreason, TIN - Missing, TIN - MismatchYTD volumeTax forms with the specified\nyear-to-date volumeCorrectionCorrection status: Correction,\nOriginalThresholdState or federal threshold status: Meets federal threshold,\nMeets state threshold, Meets any threshold, Meets state and federal threshold,\nMeets neither state nor federal thresholdsEmail addressTax forms with the\nspecified email addressMissing email addressFilter for tax forms that either\nhave or don’t have email addresses: True, FalseDelta valuesFilter for tax forms\nwith delta values: With delta values, Without delta valuesStandalone formsFilter\nfor standalone tax forms: All standalone forms, No standalone formsPaperless\ndelivery consentStatus of paperless delivery (e-delivery) consent collection:\nProvided, Not provided, RevokedGrouped TINTax forms that have grouped TINs:\nGrouped forms only, No grouped forms\n## Understand tax form status\n\nStripe automatically calculates the overall status for each tax form, and allows\nyou to apply filing requirements for each form as appropriate.
