# Accounts must now specify one of three types (Standard, Express, or Custom)Breaking changes

## What’s new

Replaces the `managed` boolean property on `Account` objects with `type`, whose
possible values are: `standard`, `express`, and `custom`. A `type` value is
required when creating accounts. The `standard` type replaces `managed: false`,
and the `custom` type replaces `managed: true`.

## Impact

Introduces a more nuanced classification system for `Account` objects, replacing
the binary `managed` property with a `type` property that offers three distinct
account types. You can now create and identify accounts with greater
specificity.
