  "content": "# Handle verification with the API\n\n## Learn how Connect platforms can use webhooks and the API to handle verification of connected accounts.\n\nPlatforms with accounts created using the API can provide Stripe with necessary\ninformation about their users for [Know Your\nCustomer](https://support.stripe.com/questions/know-your-customer) (KYC)\npurposes. Platforms can use [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)\nOnboarding to collect KYC information, or use the\n[Accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts) and\n[Persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons) APIs to provide Stripe with\nrequired information. We’ll then perform verification, asking for more\ninformation when needed.\n\nThe rest of this page goes through how platforms:\n\n- Discover verification requirements for a connected account\n- Provide the necessary information to Stripe\n\n#### Note\n\nYou can’t use the API to respond to Stripe risk reviews. You can enable your\nconnected accounts to respond using embedded components, Stripe-hosted\nonboarding, or remediation links. You can also use the Dashboard to respond to\nrisk reviews on behalf of your connected accounts.\n\n## Verification process\n\nBefore enabling charges and [payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts) for a\nconnected account, Stripe needs certain information that varies based on:\n\n- The origin country of the connected accounts\n- The [service agreement\ntype](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/service-agreement-types) applicable to the\nconnected accounts\n- The [capabilities](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities)\nrequested for the connected accounts\n- The [business\ntype](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-business_type)\n(for example, individual or company) and\n[company.structure](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-company-structure)\n(for example, public corporation or private partnership)\n\nPlatforms need to choose the proper [onboarding\nflow](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/identity-verification#onboarding-flows)\nfor their business and users to meet the KYC requirements. Broadly speaking,\nthis means providing all the requisite information upfront or incrementally.\nEither way, set up your integration to watch for and respond to requests from\nStripe.\n\n- Establish a [Connect webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/webhooks) URL in\nyour [webhook settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/webhooks) to watch\nfor activity, especially events of the `account.updated` type. When using the\n[Persons API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons), you should also watch for\n`person.updated` events.\n- Immediately after creating an account, check the `Account` object’s\n[requirements.currently_due](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-requirements-currently_due)\nattribute for any additional requirements. Obtain any required information from\nthe user and update the connected account.\n- Continue watching for `account.updated` event notifications to see if the\n`requirements` hash changes, and reach out to your user for additional\ninformation as needed.\n\nWhen you provide additional information, you don’t need to resubmit any\npreviously verified details. For example, if the `dob` is already verified, you\ndon’t need to provide it again in subsequent updates.\n\n#### Caution\n\nWhen `requirements.currently_due` isn’t empty, additional information is\nrequired. Connected accounts might be blocked from creating charges, receiving\npayouts, or performing certain tasks if you don’t provide this information in a\ntimely manner.\n\n### Change information after verification\n\nAfter an individual or company is verified, you can [change some of their\ninformation](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/update-verified-information), with\nlimitations. See the [Update\nAccount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/update) API for limitations based\non the configuration of the connected account. [Contact\nsupport](https://support.stripe.com/contact) to make changes outside of these\nlimitations.\n\n## Determine if verification is needed\n\nWhen you receive an `account.updated` event to your webhook or [fetch an\naccount](https://docs.stripe.com/api#retrieve_account) with the API, you receive\nan [Account](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object) object. The `Account`\nobject’s `charges_enabled` and `payouts_enabled` attributes indicate whether the\naccount can create charges and accept payouts.\n\nThe `Account` object has a `requirements` hash, representing the requirements\nneeded to verify the account.\n\nThe `requirements` hash has the following arrays:\n\n- `eventually_due`: Requirements that you might need to collect, depending on\nwhether the corresponding thresholds are reached. After a requirement becomes\nrequired, it also appears in the `currently_due` list. If a requirement becomes\nrequired and its due date is before the existing `current_deadline`, the\n`current_deadline` changes to the corresponding threshold’s enforcement date.\n- `currently_due`: Requirements that you must collect by the `current_deadline`\nfor the Account to remain `active`. `currently_due` is a subset of\n`eventually_due`.\n- `past_due`: Requirements that have disabled capabilities because they weren’t\nverified before the `current_deadline`. `past_due` is a subset of\n`currently_due`.\n- `errors`: Details about validation and verification failures that require\nparticular requirements in `currently_due` or `past_due` to be collected again.-\n`requirement`: Identifies the requirement corresponding to the error.\n- `code`: An enum value describing why the requirement is invalid or can’t be\nverified.\n- `reason`: An message describing the error in more detail. The reason\nstring can also suggest how to resolve the error.\n- `disabled_reason`: Describes why the Account isn’t enabled and why it can’t\nprocess charges or transfers.\n- `current_deadline`: Date by which requirements in `currently_due` must be\ncollected to keep the Account `active`. It represents the earliest deadline\nacross all of the Account’s requested capabilities and risk requirements,\nincluding any hidden capabilities.\n- `pending_verification`: Requirements that might become required, depending on\nthe results of verification or review. It’s an empty array unless an\nasynchronous verification is pending. Unsuccessful verification moves a\nrequirement to `eventually_due`, `currently_due`, or `past_due`. A requirement\nsubject to both failed and pending verifications can also remain in\n`pending_verification`.\n\nThe example below shows what the `requirements` hash might look like for an\naccount that has some information that’s `currently_due`, some information\nthat’s `eventually_due`, and some information that’s raising verification\n`errors`.\n\n```\n{\n \"id\": \"{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}\",\n \"object\": \"account\",\n \"requirements\": {\n \"disabled_reason\": null,\n \"current_deadline\": 1529085600,\n \"past_due\": [],\n \"currently_due\": [\n \"company.tax_id\",\n \"company.verification.document\",\n \"tos_acceptance.date\",\n \"tos_acceptance.ip\"\n ],\n \"eventually_due\": [\n \"company.address.city\",\n \"company.address.line1\",\n \"company.address.postal_code\",\n \"company.address.state\",\n \"company.tax_id\",\n \"company.verification.document\",\n \"external_account\",\n \"tos_acceptance.date\",\n \"tos_acceptance.ip\"\n ],\n \"errors\": [\n {\n \"requirement\": \"company.verification.document\",\n\"reason\": \"The company name on the account couldn't be verified. Either update\nyour business name or upload a document containing the business name.\",\n \"code\": \"failed_name_match\"\n },\n ]\n },\n ...\n}\n```\n\nIf `requirements.currently_due` contains entries, check\n`requirements.current_deadline`. The `current_deadline` is a Unix timestamp\nidentifying when information is needed. Usually, if Stripe doesn’t receive the\ninformation by the `current_deadline`, payouts on the account are disabled.\nHowever, other consequences might apply in some situations. For example, if\npayouts are already disabled and the account is unresponsive to our inquiries,\nStripe might also disable the ability to process charges.\n\nSeparately, the\n[requirements.disabled_reason](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-requirements-disabled_reason)\nproperty can have a value. The value is a string describing the reason why this\naccount is unable to make payouts or charges. In some instances, platforms and\nconnected accounts can submit a form to resolve or appeal the reason.\n\n- Connected accounts with access to the full Stripe Dashboard and Standard\naccounts can access additional information (if available) in the Dashboard.\n- Platforms in any Connect configuration can navigate to [Accounts to\nreview](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard/review-actionable-accounts) to\nunderstand an account’s `disabled_reason`. You might be able to provide\nadditional information on behalf of your connected accounts. If the disabled\nreason is associated with an appeal, you can generate a link to a form for the\naccount to resolve the appeal.\nReasonMeaning`action_required.requested_capabilities`You need to request\ncapabilities for the connected account. For details, see [Request and unrequest\ncapabilities](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities#requesting-unrequesting).`listed`Account\nmight be on a prohibited persons or companies list (Stripe investigates and\neither rejects or reinstates the account accordingly).`rejected.fraud`Account is\nrejected due to suspected fraud or illegal\nactivity.`rejected.incomplete_verification`The account is rejected from\nincomplete verification requirements within the required\nthreshold.`rejected.listed`Account is rejected because it’s on a third-party\nprohibited persons or companies list (such as financial services provider or\ngovernment).`rejected.other`Account is rejected for another\nreason.`rejected.terms_of_service`Account is rejected due to suspected terms of\nservice violations.`requirements.past_due`Additional verification information is\nrequired to enable capabilities on this\naccount.`requirements.pending_verification`Stripe is currently verifying\ninformation on the connected account. No action is required. Inspect the\n[requirements.pending_verification](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-requirements-pending_verification)\narray to see the information being verified.`under_review`The account is under\nreview by Stripe.\n## Validation and verification errors\n\nThe [Account](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object) object includes a\n[requirements.errors](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-requirements-errors)\narray that explains why the validation or verification requirements haven’t been\nmet, which are needed to enable your account and capabilities. The `errors`\narray has the following attributes:\n\n- `requirement`: Specifies which information from the `currently_due` array is\nneeded.\n- `code`: Indicates the type of error that occurred. See the [API\nreference](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-requirements-errors-code)\nfor all possible error codes.\n- `reason`: Explains why the error occurred and how to resolve the error.\n\nBelow is an example that shows what the `errors` array might look like for an\naccount with requirements that are `currently_due`. The example shows the reason\nwhy the submitted information can’t be used to enable the account, and how to\nresolve the error. If verification or validation is unsuccessful, requirements\ncan reappear in `currently_due` with error information. Set a [Connect\nwebhook](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/webhooks) to receive the\n`account.updated` event to receive these updates.\n\n```\n{\n \"id\": \"{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}\",\n \"object\": \"account\",\n \"requirements\": {\n \"current_deadline\": 1234567800,\n \"currently_due\": [\n \"company.address.line1\",\n \"{{PERSON_ID}}.verification.document\",\n ],\n \"errors\": [\n {\n \"requirement\": \"company.address.line1\",\n \"code\": \"invalid_street_address\",\n\"reason\": \"The provided street address cannot be found. Please verify the street\nname and number are correct in \\\"10 Downing Street\\\"\",\n },\n {\n \"requirement\": \"{{PERSON_ID}}.verification.document\",\n \"code\": \"verification_document_failed_greyscale\",\n\"reason\": \"Greyscale documents cannot be read. Please upload a color copy of the\ndocument.\",\n }\n ]\n },\n ...\n}\n```\n\nIf verification or validation is unsuccessful but no requirements are currently\ndue, a webhook triggers indicating that required information is eventually due.\n\n## Business information\n\nWhen information about a business is submitted, Stripe verifies the new\ninformation. For example, Stripe might verify that the provided business URL is\nvalid, reachable, and includes information about the business. To retrieve the\nstatus of verification information regarding a business, utilize the\n`requirements` on the Account object.\n\nBelow is a list of errors related to business information verification:\n\nErrorResolution`invalid_business_profile_name`Business names must be easy for\npeople to understand and must consist of recognizable\nwords.`invalid_business_profile_name_denylisted`Generic or well-known business\nnames aren’t supported. Make sure the provided business name matches the\naccount’s business.`invalid_product_description_length`A product description\nmust be at least 10 characters.`invalid_product_description_url_match`A product\ndescription must be different from the URL of the business.\n`invalid_url_denylisted`\n\n`invalid_url_format`\n\n`invalid_url_web_presence_detected`\n\n`invalid_url_website_business_information_mismatch`\n\n`invalid_url_website_empty`\n\n`invalid_url_website_inaccessible`\n\n`invalid_url_website_inaccessible_geoblocked`\n\n`invalid_url_website_inaccessible_password_protected`\n\n`invalid_url_website_incomplete`\n\n`invalid_url_website_incomplete_cancellation_policy`\n\n`invalid_url_website_incomplete_customer_service_details`\n\n`invalid_url_website_incomplete_legal_restrictions`\n\n`invalid_url_website_incomplete_refund_policy`\n\n`invalid_url_website_incomplete_return_policy`\n\n`invalid_url_website_incomplete_terms_and_conditions`\n\n`invalid_url_website_incomplete_under_construction`\n\n`invalid_url_website_other`\n\nSee [handling URL verification\nerrors](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/handling-api-verification#url-verification)\nbelow.\n\n## Statement descriptors\n\nStripe validates the statement descriptor and statement descriptor prefix when\n[set on an account](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/statement-descriptors). For\nexample, Stripe might verify that the provided statement descriptor matches the\ndescription of the business. When validating the statement descriptor matches\nthe business description, Stripe uses the first 22 characters of the statement\ndescriptor, representing the part that is provided to the card networks. A\nbusiness description is a close match of the account’s `business_profile.name`,\n`business_profile.url`, or the name of the company or individual.\n\nTo retrieve the status of verification information regarding statement\ndescriptors, review the `requirements` on the Account object. Below is a list of\nerrors related to statement descriptor verification:\n\nErrorResolution`invalid_statement_descriptor_length`A statement descriptor must\nbe at least 5 characters.`invalid_statement_descriptor_business_mismatch`A\nstatement descriptor must be similar to the business name, legal entity name, or\nURL of the account.\n`invalid_statement_descriptor_denylisted`\n\n`invalid_statement_descriptor_prefix_denylisted`\n\nGeneric or well-known statement descriptors aren’t supported.\n\n`invalid_statement_descriptor_prefix_mismatch`The statement descriptor prefix\nmust be similar to your statement descriptor, business name, legal entity name,\nor URL.\n## Person information\n\nDuring the verification process, information about the persons associated with\nan account needs to be collected. If you onboard:\n\n- Only companies, use the [Persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons) API to\ncollect this information.\n- Only individuals, you can use the\n[Persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons) API or the\n[individual](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-individual)\nhash on the Account object.\n- A combination of individuals and companies, use the\n[Persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons) API to collect this information.\nThis way you collect information in the same manner regardless of business type.\n\nTo retrieve the status of verification information regarding a person, use the\n[requirements](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/object#person_object-requirements)\nhash.\n\nBelow is a list of errors related to person verification:\n\nErrorResolution`invalid_address_city_state_postal_code`Stripe couldn’t validate\nthe combination of the city, state, and postal code in the provided\naddress.`invalid_address_highway_contract_box`The address of the person must be\na valid physical address from which the account conducts business and can’t be a\nHighway Contract Box.`invalid_address_private_mailbox`The address of the person\nmust be a valid physical address from which the account conducts business and\ncan’t be a private mailbox.`invalid_dob_age_under_minimum`The person must be at\nleast 13 years old.`invalid_dob_age_over_maximum`The person’s date of birth must\nbe within the past 120 years.`invalid_phone_number`Stripe couldn’t validate the\nphone number on the account. Make sure the formatting matches the country of the\nperson.`invalid_street_address`Stripe couldn’t validate the street name and/or\nnumber for the provided address.\n`invalid_tax_id`\n\n`invalid_tax_id_format`\n\nTax IDs must be a unique set of 9 numbers without dashes or other special\ncharacters.\n\n## Acceptable verification documents by country\n\nTo learn about specific document requirements, view [Acceptable verification\ndocuments by\ncountry](https://docs.stripe.com/acceptable-verification-documents).\n\n## Company information\n\nDuring the verification process, you might need to collect information about the\ncompany for an account.\n\nTo retrieve the status of verification information regarding an account’s\ncompany, use the Account’s\n[company.verification](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-company-verification)\nsubhash:\n\n```\n{\n \"id\": \"{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}\",\n \"object\": \"account\",\n ...\n \"company\": {\n \"verification\": {\n \"document\": null\n },\n ...\n },\n ...\n}\n```\n\nYou can look up the definition for each verification attribute on the\n[Account](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-company-verification)\nobject.\n\n## Handle document verification problems\n\nMany complications with the verification process involve the uploaded document\nitself. To help you recognize and handle the most common problems, the table\nbelow lists possible values for the error `code` (in the `requirements.errors`\narray) and the likely resolutions for each error.\n\nBelow is a list of errors related to document upload:\n\nErrorResolution\n`verification_document_corrupt`\n\n`verification_document_failed_copy`\n\n`verification_document_failed_greyscale`\n\n`verification_document_incomplete`\n\n`verification_document_not_readable`\n\n`verification_document_not_uploaded`\n\n`verification_document_not_signed`\n\n`verification_document_missing_back`\n\n`verification_document_missing_front`\n\n`verification_document_too_large`\n\nThe upload failed due to a problem with the file itself. Ask your user to\nprovide a new file that meets these requirements:\n\n- Color image (8,000 pixels by 8,000 pixels or smaller)\n- 10 MB or less\n- Identity documents are JPG or PNG format\n- Address or legal entity documents are JPG, PNG, or PDF format\n- Legal entity documents must include all pages\n- Must not be password protected\n\n`verification_document_country_not_supported`\n\n`verification_document_invalid`\n\n`verification_document_type_not_supported`\n\nThe provided file isn’t an acceptable form of ID from a supported country, or\nisn’t a type of legal entity document that is expected. Ask your user to provide\na new file that meets that requirement. For a list, see [Acceptable ID types by\ncountry](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/handling-api-verification#acceptable-verification-documents).\n\n`verification_failed_other`\n\n`verification_document_failed_other`\n\nYour team can contact Stripe to learn more about why identity verification\nfailed.\n\n`verification_document_expired`\n\n`verification_document_issue_or_expiry_date_missing`\n\nThe issue or expiry date is missing on the document, or the document is expired.\nIf it’s an identity document, its expiration date must be after the date the\ndocument was submitted. If it’s an address document, the issue date must be\nwithin the last six months.\n\nBelow is a list of errors related to identity verification:\n\nErrorResolution`verification_failed_keyed_identity`The name on the account\ncouldn’t be verified. Ask your user to verify that they have provided their full\nlegal name and to also provide a photo ID matching that name.\n`verification_document_name_mismatch`\n\n`verification_document_dob_mismatch`\n\n`verification_document_address_mismatch`\n\n`verification_document_id_number_mismatch`\n\n`verification_document_photo_mismatch`\n\nThe information on the ID document doesn’t match the information provided by the\nuser. Ask your user to verify and correct the provided information on the\naccount.\n\n`verification_document_fraudulent`\n\n`verification_document_manipulated`\n\nThe document might have been altered so it couldn’t be verified. Your team can\ncontact Stripe to learn more.\n\nBelow is a list of errors related to business verification:\n\nErrorResolution\n`verification_failed_keyed_match`\n\n`verification_failed_document_match`\n\nThe information on the account couldn’t be verified. Your user can either upload\na document to confirm their account details, or update their information on\ntheir account.\n\n`verification_failed_tax_id_not_issued`\n\n`verification_failed_tax_id_match`\n\nThe information that your user provided couldn’t be verified with the IRS. Ask\nyour user to correct any possible errors in the company name or tax ID, or\nupload a document that contains those fields. (US only)\n\n`verification_failed_id_number_match`\n\n`verification_failed_name_match`\n\n`verification_failed_address_match`\n\nThe information on the document doesn’t match the information provided by the\nuser. Ask your user to verify and correct the provided information on the\naccount, or upload a document with information that matches the account.\n\n`verification_document_address_missing`\n\n`verification_document_id_number_missing`\n\n`verification_document_name_missing`\n\nThe uploaded document is missing a required field. Ask your user to upload\nanother document that contains the missing field.\n\n#### Caution\n\nDon’t resubmit a file that previously failed. Duplicate uploads immediately\ntrigger an error and aren’t rechecked.\n\n## Handle URL verification errors\n\nURLs for e-commerce businesses need to conform to certain card network\nstandards. In order to comply with these standards, Stripe conducts a number of\nverifications when reviewing URLs. To learn about best practices for URLs and\ncommon elements for e-commerce businesses, see the [website\nchecklist](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/checklist/website). There are two\nmethods to resolve URL verification errors:\n\n- **Using the API**: Please see the list of error codes below in order to\nunderstand and resolve the issue you are facing. If you need to update the URL,\nuse the [Update Account](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/update) API, which\nwill trigger Stripe to verify the new URL. If you have made changes to the\nwebsite at the provided URL in order to resolve an error, but do not need to\nmake changes to the URL itself, you can trigger reverification by using the API\nto change the URL to any other value and then change it back.\n- **Using the Dashboard**: Platforms can use the [Accounts to\nreview](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard/review-actionable-accounts)\npage or the [Actions\nrequired](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard/managing-individual-accounts#actions-required)\nlist on the Account details page in the Stripe Dashboard to understand the\nimpact to their connected accounts and what actions to take.\n\nNot all URL-related issues can be resolved using the API. Certain types of URL\nverification errors require additional information on how to access the\nconnected account’s website or to attest that the account is exempt from URL\nrequirements. These types of issues require you or your connected account to\nprovide supplemental information.\n\nIn the Dashboard, visit your [Accounts to\nreview](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/accounts_to_review) page or check\nthe [Actions\nrequired](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard/managing-individual-accounts#actions-required)\nlist (if present) on the Account details page to resolve the error. If you can’t\nresolve the issue, direct your connected account to [contact Stripe\nSupport](https://support.stripe.com/contact). For guidance on how to review your\naccounts, see [Review actionable\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard/review-actionable-accounts).\n\n#### Note\n\nStripe’s Terms of Service requires all e-commerce businesses to populate the\n[business_profile.url](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-business_profile-url)\nproperty with a working URL of their business website when activating an account\nwith the `card_payments` capability. An account is considered an e-commerce\nbusiness if it promotes or sells any products or services through an online\nwebsite, social media profile, or mobile application. If the account doesn’t\noperate a website to promote their business, sell products, or accept payments,\nthey’re required to provide\n[business_profile.product_description](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-business_profile-product_description)\ninstead. A product description needs to detail the type of products being sold\nas well as the manner in which the account’s customers are being charged (e.g.\nin person transactions). For more information, please see: [Business website for\naccount activation\nFAQ](https://support.stripe.com/questions/business-website-for-account-activation-faq).\n\nTo help you handle the most common errors associated with the\n`business_profile.url` field, the following table lists the related error codes\n(in the `requirements.errors` array) and possible resolutions.\n\nErrorResolution`invalid_url_denylisted`The provided URL matches a generic\nbusiness website that Stripe believes is unrelated to the account. To resolve\nthe issue, provide a URL that is specific to the\nbusiness.`invalid_url_format`The provided URL is in the incorrect format. To\nresolve the issue, provide a correctly formatted URL, such as\n`https://example.com`.`invalid_url_website_inaccessible`We can’t reach the\nwebsite at the provided URL. If you block certain regions from viewing your\nwebsite, temporarily remove the blocker until your website has been\nverified.`invalid_url_website_business_information_mismatch`Information on the\nwebsite at the provided URL does not match the information on the Stripe\naccount.`invalid_url_website_incomplete`The website at the provided URL is\nmissing either a business name or a clear description of goods and services\noffered.`invalid_url_website_other`We are unable to verify the account’s\nbusiness using a website, social media profile, or mobile application at the\nprovided URL.`invalid_url_web_presence_detected`We have detected that the\naccount uses a website, social media profile, or mobile application to sell or\npromote products or services, but a URL hasn’t been provided. To resolve the\nissue, provide a\nURL.`invalid_url_website_incomplete_customer_service_details`The website does\nnot contain customer service\ndetails.`invalid_url_website_incomplete_return_policy`The website does not\ncontain a return policy and\nprocess.`invalid_url_website_incomplete_refund_policy`The website does not\ncontain a refund policy.`invalid_url_website_incomplete_cancellation_policy`The\nwebsite does not contain a cancellation\npolicy.`invalid_url_website_incomplete_legal_restrictions`The website does not\ncontain applicable disclosures for products and services that are subject to\nlegal or export\nrestrictions.`invalid_url_website_incomplete_terms_and_conditions`The website\ndoes not contain terms and\nconditions.`invalid_url_website_incomplete_under_construction`We are unable to\nverify the website at the provided URL, because the website is still under\nconstruction.`invalid_url_website_inaccessible_password_protected`We are unable\nto verify the website at the provided URL, because the website is\npassword-protected.`invalid_url_website_inaccessible_geoblocked`We are unable to\nverify the website at the provided URL, because certain regions are blocked from\naccessing it. If you block certain regions from viewing your website,\ntemporarily remove the blocker until your website has been\nverified.`invalid_url_website_empty`We are unable to verify the website at the\nprovided URL, because the website has no content.\n## Handle identity verification\n\nYou can respond in two ways to an identity verification change. The first is to\nperform an [Update\nAccount](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/updating-service-agreements) call,\ncorrecting or adding information.\n\nSecondarily, we might ask you to upload a document. Depending on how much of the\nuser’s information Stripe has been able to verify, we might require three\ndifferent types of document uploads. You can determine what documents to upload\nbased on the fields listed in `requirements.currently_due`:\n\n- `person.verification.document`: Requires a color scan or photo of an\nacceptable form of ID.\n- `person.verification.additional_document`: Requires a color scan or photo of a\ndocument verifying the user’s address, such as a utility bill.\n- `company.verification.document`: Requires a proof of entity document\nestablishing the business’ entity ID number, such as the company’s articles of\nincorporation.\n\nUploading a document is a two-step process:\n\n- Upload the file to Stripe\n- Attach the file to the account\n\n#### Note\n\nFor security reasons, Stripe doesn’t accept copies of IDs sent by email.\n\n### Upload a file\n\nTo upload a file, use the [Create\nFile](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files/create) API by using a POST to send the\nfile data as part of a multipart/form-data request.\n\nThe uploaded file must meet these requirements:\n\n- Color image (8,000 pixels by 8,000 pixels or smaller)\n- 10 MB or less\n- Identity documents are JPG or PNG format\n- Address or legal entity documents are JPG, PNG, or PDF format\n\nPass the file data in the `file` parameter and set the `purpose` parameter to\n`identity_document`:\n\n```\ncurl https://files.stripe.com/v1/files \\\n -u sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2: \\\n -H \"Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTED_STRIPE_ACCOUNT_ID}}\" \\\n -F \"purpose\"=\"identity_document\" \\\n -F \"file\"=\"@/path/to/a/file\"\n```\n\nThis request uploads the file and returns a token:\n\n```\n{\n \"id\": \"{{FILE_ID}}\",\n \"created\": 1403047735,\n \"size\": 4908\n}\n```\n\nYou may then use the token’s `id` value to attach the file to a connected\naccount for identity verification.\n\n### Attach the file\n\nAfter you upload the file and receive a representative token, provide the file\nID using the appropriate field in your [Update\nAccount](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/updating-service-agreements) call.\n\nBelow is an example for an ID document:\n\n```\ncurl\nhttps://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts/{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}/persons/{{PERSON_ID}}\n\\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d \"verification[document][front]\"={{FILE_ID}}\n```\n\nBelow is an example for a company document:\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts/{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}} \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d \"company[verification][document][front]\"={{FILE_ID}}\n```\n\nThis update changes `verification.status` to `pending`. If an additional person\nneeds to be verified, use the [Persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons) API\nto update them.\n\n### Confirm ID verification\n\nIf the color scan or photo of the ID passes Stripe’s checks, the document\nrequirement is removed from `requirements.currently_due`. Satisfying all\nverification requirements for the person or company triggers an\n`account.updated` webhook notification signaling the verification process is\ncomplete.\n\nVerification can take Stripe from a few minutes, to a couple business days to\ncomplete, depending on how readable the provided image is.\n\nIf the verification attempt fails, the `requirements.errors` array contains an\nerror stating the cause. The `error[reason]`, such as “The image supplied isn’t\nreadable,” is safe to present to your user, but isn’t localized. The response\nalso contains an `error[code]` value, such as\n`verification_document_not_readable`, which you can use to localize errors for\nyour users. Upon failure, `requirements.currently_due` indicates that a new ID\nupload is required. If the deadline for verification is near,\n`requirements.current_deadline` might also be populated with a date.\nVerification failure also triggers an `account.updated` webhook notification.\n\n## Handle risk verifications\n\n#### New risk requirements\n\nThe following risk-related requirement data will be generally available on\nNovember 12, 2024. You can opt in to receiving it sooner by following [the\ninstructions provided by Stripe\nSupport](https://support.stripe.com/questions/get-risk-related-requirements-for-connected-accounts-via-api).\n\nStripe reports risk and compliance requirements in the\n[accounts.requirements](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-requirements)\nattribute. These requirements follow the schema:\n`<id>.<requirement_description>.<resolution_path>`:\n\n- `id` uniquely identifies information needed by Stripe or our financial\npartners. This identifier is always prefixed with `interv_` to indicate that it\nis a risk verification requirement.\n- `requirement_description` specifically describes the information needed to\ncomplete the requirement, such as `identity_verification`, `rejection_appeal`,\nand so on.\n- `resolution_path` specifies how you or your connected account can provide the\nrequested information:- `challenge`: Connected accounts must directly respond to\nchallenge prompts. They often require sensitive information, such as a bank\naccount, or information that only the account owner can provide, such as a\nselfie.\n- `form`: Connected accounts can complete form requests, or you can complete\nthem on their behalf.\n- `support`: The requirement isn’t directly actionable. Contact [Stripe\nSupport](https://support.stripe.com/).\n\n```\n{\n \"id\": \"{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}\",\n \"object\": \"account\",\n \"requirements\": {\n \"current_deadline\": 1234567800,\n \"currently_due\": [\n \"{{REQUIREMENT_ID}}.restricted_or_prohibited_industry_diligence.form\"\n ],\n \"pending_verification\": [],\n ...\n },\n ...\n}\n```\n\nAfter satisfying a resolution path, the value of the requirement’s resolution\npath might change to `support` and the requirement also appears in the\n`pending_verification` section of the requirements hash. Stripe verifies the\nsubmitted information and either dismisses the requirement as resolved or posts\na new currently due requirement.\n\n```\n{\n \"id\": \"{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}\",\n \"object\": \"account\",\n \"requirements\": {\n \"current_deadline\": 1234567800,\n \"currently_due\": [],\n \"pending_verification\": [\n \"{{REQUIREMENT_ID}}.restricted_or_prohibited_industry_diligence.support\"\n ],\n ...\n },\n ...\n}\n```\n\nYou can remediate risk and compliance requirements in any of the following ways,\ndepending on the type of requirement:\n\n- **Connect embedded components:** You can [embed Connect\ncomponents](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\ndirectly into your website. When a requirement surfaces, direct your users to\nthe [account\nonboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/supported-embedded-components/account-onboarding)\nembedded component, where they’re prompted to complete outstanding requirements\ndirectly in your UI. Alternatively, use the [Notification\nbanner](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/supported-embedded-components/notification-banner)\nembedded component to prompt your users for any outstanding requirements.\n- **Stripe hosted onboarding:** You can generate links to direct your connected\naccounts to complete outstanding requirements programmatically through account\nlinks or manually in your [platform\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard/review-actionable-accounts).\n- **Complete on behalf of your accounts:** You can use your [platform\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard/review-actionable-accounts)\nto identify and complete form-based risk requirements from connected account\ndetail on behalf of your accounts.\n\nThe following `requirement_description` values are relevant to requirements\nshown in the `account.requirements` attribute.\n\nValueDescription`business_model_verification`We require additional information\nabout the nature of the business to verify that we can support the\naccount.`restricted_or_prohibited_industry_diligence`The business might operate\nin [a restricted category](https://stripe.com/legal/restricted-businesses) (for\nexample, selling alcohol, insurance, or financial products).
