# The Charges object no longer auto-expands refunds by defaultBreaking changes

## What’s new

The `Charge` object no longer auto-expands refunds. While you can manually
expand refunds, Stripe recommends against it for performance reasons.

## Impact

This change improves API response times and reduces data transfer, but might
require updates to existing code that relied on automatically expanded refund
information.
