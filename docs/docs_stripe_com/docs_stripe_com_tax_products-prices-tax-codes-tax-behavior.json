  "content": "# Specify product tax codes and tax behavior\n\n## Add tax codes and tax behavior to your products and prices to automatically calculate tax.\n\n#### Note\n\n[Log in](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/tax) or [sign\nup](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register) for Stripe to enable Stripe Tax.\n\nStripe Tax uses product tax codes (PTCs) to associate products with their\napplicable tax rates, which might be lower or higher in different cities or\ncountries. [Assign each of your products a tax\ncode](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/products-prices-tax-codes-tax-behavior#tax-code-on-product)\nto automatically apply the rate and other taxability rules.\n\nIf a product doesn’t fit any of the specific codes, use one of the codes with\n“General” in its name to apply the standard rate of the jurisdiction. See our\n[list of available tax codes](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes).\n\n## Preset tax codes\n\nWhen activating Stripe Tax you can set two types of preset tax codes: one for\nproducts and one for shipping. You can set both in the [Tax\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/tax) in the Dashboard.\n\n![The tax settings showing the preset tax codes, and the default shipping tax\ncode.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/pp-settings-v3.4a3660016d805248b9fb49f1bffffd76.png)\n\nThe tax settings showing the preset tax codes, and the default shipping tax\ncode.\n\n### Preset product tax code\n\nThe preset product tax code represents your product or service in Stripe Tax. We\nuse the preset if you don’t explicitly specify a `tax_code` on your\n[products](https://docs.stripe.com/api/products) or in\n[product_data](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/create#create_price-product_data)\non your transactions. As you process payments, we also use the preset tax code\nto display the tax thresholds you might be approaching or have exceeded, under\nthe **Threshold monitoring** section in your tax settings.\n\nIf you sell multiple different product types (for example, SaaS and e-books),\nyou could use test mode to change your preset tax code and review the impact of\ndifferent product types on the **Monitor** tab.\n\n### Preset shipping tax code\n\nThe preset shipping tax code represents the tax treatment for shipping fees when\ncharged. We use this if you don’t explicitly specify a `tax_code` on a shipping\nrate. Stripe Tax allows you to change the default shipping treatment to\nNontaxable if you don’t want to charge any tax on shipping fees. We recommend\nyou leave the default as “Shipping” to ensure the correct tax is always charged.\n\nTo charge tax on shipping for recurring payments, you can create a Product or\npass `product_data` for a line item called “shipping” and select the shipping\n`tax_code`.\n\nThe taxability of shipping can vary by US state and country.\n\n![Map of the United States showing states where shipping is taxable, not\ntaxable, or have no sales\ntax.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/pp_shipping_us_taxability.e90be097aec68286cbc6a83a4e5bfc13.png)\n\n## Tax behavior\n\nYou must specify a `tax_behavior` on a price, or a default tax behavior in the\ntax settings in the Dashboard, which determines how tax is presented to the\nbuyer. This allows you to localize your checkout depending on the market. When\nyou set tax behavior to exclusive, it adds tax onto the subtotal amount you\nspecify on your price. This is common in US markets and for B2B sales. When set\nto inclusive, the amount your buyer pays never changes, even if the tax rate\nvaries. This is common practice for B2C buyers in many markets outside the US.\n\n### Setting a default tax behavior (recommended)\n\nYou can define a default tax behavior that applies to every price that has no\ntax behavior defined. You can setup the default tax behavior in the [Stripe Tax\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/tax) under the **Include tax in\nprices** section.\n\nAfter you set the default tax behavior, all prices that don’t have a\n`tax_behavior` defined, use this setting and are ready for Stripe Tax. The\noptions for the default tax behavior are:\n\n- **Automatic**: The tax behavior is based on the currency that’s chosen for a\nproduct price. For the currencies `USD` and `CAD` the tax behavior is exclusive.\nFor all other currencies the tax behavior is inclusive. This also works with\n[multi-currency\nPrices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models#multicurrency).\n- **Inclusive**: Inclusive tax is already included in the price. For example, a\nproduct has the price defined as 5.00 USD. The final price the customer pays is\n5.00 USD.\n- **Exclusive**: Exclusive tax is added on top of the price. For example, a\nproduct has the price defined as 5.00 USD. The tax charged on this product could\nbe 10% and would result in a final price of 5.50 USD. (Tax rates might\ndiffer—this is only an explanatory example.)\n\nTo override this setting for an individual price, [set a tax behavior on a\nprice](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/products-prices-tax-codes-tax-behavior#setting-tax-behavior-on-a-price-(optional)).\n\n## Setting tax behavior on a price (optional)\n\nYou can set the tax behavior for a [Price](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices)\nwhen creating it with the Dashboard or the API. When creating a Price in the\nDashboard, you can inspect the impact of your pricing model on your revenue.\n\n#### Caution\n\nYou can’t change `tax_behavior` after it’s been set to one of “exclusive” or\n“inclusive”.\n\n![Tax behavior for a Price object in the Stripe\nDashboard](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/pp_pricing.c4124697874540947a451121f0c73c4d.png)\n\nTo create a Price with `tax_behavior` through the API, it might look like this:\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/prices \\\n -u sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2: \\\n -d unit_amount=10000 \\\n -d currency=usd \\\n -d product=prod_q23fxaHasd \\\n -d tax_behavior=exclusive \\\n -d \"recurring[interval]\"=month\n```\n\nFor a [multi-currency\nPrice](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models#multicurrency),\nuse the\n[currency_options.<currency>.tax_behavior](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/create#create_price-currency_options-tax_behavior)\nparameter to set different tax behaviors for different currencies.\n\nIn some cases, you might want to use a custom price that hasn’t been\npre-configured. You can pass in `price_data` instead of a price ID. For example,\naccepting a one time payment for a custom price might look like this:\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/checkout/sessions \\\n -u sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2: \\\n -d success_url=\"https://example.com/success\" \\\n -d cancel_url=\"https://example.com/cancel\" \\\n -d \"payment_method_types[0]\"=card \\\n -d \"line_items[0][price_data][currency]\"=\"usd\" \\\n -d \"line_items[0][price_data][unit_amount]\"=10000 \\\n -d \"line_items[0][price_data][tax_behavior]\"=\"exclusive\" \\\n -d \"line_items[0][price_data][product]\"=\"prod_Jb3wOhvaIOZZTM\" \\\n -d \"line_items[0][quantity]\"=2 \\\n -d mode=payment\n```\n\n## Setting a tax code on a product (recommended)\n\nWhen creating Products in the Dashboard you can set your `tax_code` in the\ndropdown by searching for any available [tax\ncode](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes). If you don’t, Stripe Tax uses the\npreset tax code defined on the\n[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/tax). If a product could fit\nmultiple codes, for example, a SaaS product used for personal or business use\ndepending on the type of customer, we recommend creating two separate products\nin Stripe and assigning the appropriate code to each.\n\n![Tax codes for a product in the Stripe\nDashboard](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/pp_product_tax_category.e6ad090b235a41108b8843420db18330.png)\n\nTo create a Product with `tax_code` using the API, it might look like this:\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/products \\\n -u sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2: \\\n -d name=\"Test Product\" \\\n -d tax_code=txcd_10000000\n```\n\nIn some cases, you might want to use a custom product that hasn’t been\npre-configured. You can pass in `product_data` instead of a product ID. For\nexample, accepting a one time payment for a custom product might look like this:\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/checkout/sessions \\\n -u sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2: \\\n -d success_url=\"https://example.com/success\" \\\n -d cancel_url=\"https://example.com/cancel\" \\\n -d \"payment_method_types[0]\"=card \\\n -d \"line_items[0][price_data][currency]\"=\"usd\" \\\n -d \"line_items[0][price_data][unit_amount]\"=10000 \\\n -d \"line_items[0][price_data][tax_behavior]\"=\"exclusive\" \\\n -d \"line_items[0][price_data][product_data][name]\"=\"Product name\" \\\n -d \"line_items[0][price_data][product_data][tax_code]\"=txcd_10000000 \\\n -d \"line_items[0][quantity]\"=2 \\\n -d mode=payment\n```\n\n## Creating a shipping rate with tax code (optional)\n\nCheckout payment mode allows you to set shipping rates and charge tax on\nshipping. You can automatically calculate tax on shipping charges by setting the\ntax code on the shipping rate in the Dashboard or\n[API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/shipping_rates).\n\n![Shipping rate with a tax code in the Stripe\nDashboard](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/pp_shipping_rate_v3.a204f73ab02310683aace14717d960f4.png)\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/shipping_rates \\\n -u sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2: \\\n -d display_name=\"Ground shipping\" \\\n -d type=\"fixed_amount\" \\\n -d \"fixed_amount[amount]\"=500 \\\n -d \"fixed_amount[currency]\"=usd \\\n -d tax_behavior=\"inclusive\" \\\n -d tax_code=\"txcd_92010001\"\n```\n\n## Interested in using Stripe Tax for events where the location differs from a customer's address and might be subject to special local and state taxes?\n\nProvide your email address below and our team will contact you soon.\n\nCollect EmailSign upRead our [privacy policy](https://stripe.com/privacy).\n## See also\n\n- [Checkout and Tax](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/checkout)\n- [Invoicing and Tax](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/invoicing)\n- [Determining customer\nlocations](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/customer-locations)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Log in](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/tax)\n- [sign up](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register)\n- [Assign each of your products a tax\ncode](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/products-prices-tax-codes-tax-behavior#tax-code-on-product)\n- [list of available tax codes](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes)\n- [products](https://docs.stripe.com/api/products)\n-\n[product_data](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/create#create_price-product_data)\n- [multi-currency\nPrices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models#multicurrency)\n- [Price](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices)\n-\n[currency_options.<currency>.tax_behavior](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/create#create_price-currency_options-tax_behavior)\n- [https://example.com/success](https://example.com/success)\n- [https://example.com/cancel](https://example.com/cancel)\n- [API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/shipping_rates)\n- [privacy policy](https://stripe.com/privacy)\n- [Checkout and Tax](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/checkout)\n- [Invoicing and Tax](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/invoicing)\n- [Determining customer\nlocations](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/customer-locations)",
