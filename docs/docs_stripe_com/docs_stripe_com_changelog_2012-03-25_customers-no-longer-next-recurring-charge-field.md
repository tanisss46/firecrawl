# Customers no longer include a next_recurring_charge fieldBreaking changes

## What’s new

Removes the `next_recurring_charge` property from the `Customer` object. Use the
upcoming invoice call instead.

## Impact

The removal of the `next_recurring_charge` property from the `Customer` object
encourages use of more accurate upcoming invoice call.
