For more information, read our [support\npage](https://support.stripe.com/questions/sofort-is-being-deprecated-as-a-standalone-payment-method).\n\nEffective March 31, 2025 , Stripe is discontinuing support for SOFORT as a\nseparate payment method for any business on Stripe. You must remove SOFORT\nbefore March 31, 2025 to avoid any SOFORT payment failures.\n\n#### Deadline extended\n\nOur financial partner extended the original November 29, 2024 deadline for\ndiscontinuing SOFORT as a standalone payment method to March 31, 2025 to give\nStripe users more time to make updates to their integration.\n\nThis guide provides instructions to:\n\n- Remove SOFORT from your current payment integration.\n- Explore alternative payment methods for your business and region. These\ninclude [Klarna’s](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/klarna) “pay in full\"\n(previously known as “Pay Now”) payment option.\n[Remove SOFORT from your payments\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sofort/replace#remove-sofort)\nRemoving SOFORT as a payment method affects several aspects of your integration\nand customer communication. The following sections outline key impact areas,\nsome of which might not apply to your business.\n\n### Update your payments integration\n\nThe steps to remove SOFORT depend on which type of integration you use. If\nyou’re using dynamic payment methods with any of Stripe’s prebuilt payment UIs\n(Checkout, Payment Element, Invoicing, Payment Links), Stripe automatically\nhides SOFORT from the UI.\n\nIntegration typeRemoval stepsPayment Element (mobile and web)- Remove `sofort`\nfrom the `payment_method_types` specified at [PaymentIntent\ncreation](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-payment_method_types).\n- Stop sending `sofort` as the selected payment method type at\n[confirmation](https://docs.stripe.com/js/payment_intents/confirm_sofort_payment).\nStripe CheckoutRemove `sofort` from the `payment_method_types` specified at\n[CheckoutSession\ncreation](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sofort/accept-a-payment?web-or-mobile=web&payment-ui=stripe-hosted#accept-a-payment).Stripe\nInvoicingRemove `sofort` from the `payment_settings.payment_method_types`\nspecified at the invoice’s [PaymentIntent\ncreation](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-payment_settings-payment_method_types).Direct\nAPI- Remove `sofort` from the `payment_method_types` specified at [PaymentIntent\ncreation](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sofort/accept-a-payment?web-or-mobile=web&payment-ui=direct-api#create-payment-intent)(or\nfrom the sources types, if you’re using the [Sources\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sources/object#source_object-type)).\n- Remove SOFORT from available options in your checkout.\n\n### Update future payments and subscriptions\n\nIf you use [SOFORT to set up future\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sofort/set-up-payment) or process\nrecurring payments using SEPA Direct Debit, you must also update those\nintegration paths to prevent future payments from using SOFORT.\n\n#### Note\n\nExisting SEPA direct debit [mandates](https://docs.stripe.com/api/mandates)\ninitiated by SOFORT payments remain active, since SEPA Direct Debit and SOFORT\nare distinct payment methods.\n\nIntegration typeRemoval stepsPayment Element (mobile and web)- Remove `sofort`\nfrom the `payment_method_types` specified at [PaymentIntent\ncreation](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-payment_method_types)\nfor any subscriptions.\n- Remove `sofort` from the `payment_method_types` specified at [SetupIntent\ncreation](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sofort/save-during-payment?platform=web#create-payment-intent)\nfor future off-session payments.\nStripe CheckoutRemove `sofort` from the `payment_method_types` specified at\n[CheckoutSession\ncreation](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sofort/accept-a-payment?web-or-mobile=web&payment-ui=stripe-hosted#accept-a-payment).Stripe\nInvoicingRemove `sofort` from the `payment_settings.payment_method_types`\nspecified at the invoice’s [PaymentIntent\ncreation](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-payment_settings-payment_method_types)\nfor recurring invoices.Direct API- Remove `sofort` from the\n`payment_method_types` specified at [PaymentIntent\ncreation](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sofort/accept-a-payment?web-or-mobile=web&payment-ui=direct-api#create-payment-intent)(or\nfrom the sources types, if you’re using the [Sources\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sources/object#source_object-type)) for any\nsubscriptions.\n- Remove `sofort` from the `payment_method_types` specified at [SetupIntent\ncreation](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sofort/save-during-payment?platform=web#create-payment-intent)\nfor future off-session payments.\n- Remove SOFORT from available options in your checkout.\n\n### Update Connect platform integrations\n\nTo discontinue SOFORT for platforms, connectors, or Stripe apps, you must update\nyour payments and onboarding integrations.\n\n- For new connected accounts, in the Payment methods settings page of your\n[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/payment_methods),\nchoose **Edit settings** for your connected accounts, then set **Off by\ndefault** for SOFORT to block connected accounts from re-requesting the\n`sofort_payments`\n[capability](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities).\n- Update your support articles, dashboard, and documentation to advise your\nusers that SOFORT is no longer available.\n\n### Refunds\n\nRefunds continue to process as normal beyond the discontinuation date. SOFORT\npayments support refunds up to 180 days after the original payment.\n\n### Disputes\n\nSOFORT doesn’t support disputes. Any disputes raised on SEPA direct debits\npayments are subject to the [SEPA Direct Debit dispute\nprocess](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sepa-debit#disputed-payments).\n\n[Migrate your payment flow to an alternative payment\nmethod](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sofort/replace#alternative-payment-methods)\nStripe offers many payment method options that might be suitable alternatives to\nSOFORT. How you integrate alternative payment methods depends on:\n\n- Which payment method you choose to migrate to from SOFORT. For example:-\nKlarna’s “Pay Now” payment option enabling bank transfer payments is the closest\npayment flow to SOFORT.\n- We also support [Pay By Bank](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/pay-by-bank) in\nthe UK and we’re collecting early interest in expansion to Germany.\n- How you use Stripe: are you a platform or marketplace, or a connector or app\ndeveloper?\n- Your payments integration: do you use a Stripe UI or a custom API integration?\n\n### Compare alternative payment methods\n\nWe’ve included a high-level comparison to help you review your options.
