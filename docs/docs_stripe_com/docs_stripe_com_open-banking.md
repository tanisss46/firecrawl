# Open banking support

## Stripe supports open banking so third parties can access a Stripe account.

The second EU Payment Services Directive (PSD2) implements an access model that
requires providers of payment accounts to create interfaces to allow authorized
third-party providers to access user accounts with the user’s consent. This is
known as access to accounts, or open banking.

Open banking allows third parties to request three types of access to users’
payment accounts:

- **Access account information:** Account Information Service Providers (AISPs)
can view accounts, balances and transactions of a payment account.
- **Confirming that funds are available:** Before a payment can be completed,
Payment Initiation Service Providers (PISPs) can check if the balance of an
account has sufficient funds.
- **Initiating new payments:** Payment Initiation Service Providers (PISPs) can
initiate a payment from a user’s payment account.
