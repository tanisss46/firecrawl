After you read\nthrough this guide, you’ll:\n\n- Understand the Stripe migration process.\n- Be able to scope the timeline for your migration.\n- Know the integration elements required for a successful migration.\n- Understand how to migrate payment details with minimal disruption to your\nusers.\n\nIf you run into issues while trying to migrate customer data, contact [Stripe\nsupport](https://support.stripe.com/contact/login?email=true&subject=Migration+to+Stripe).\n\n## Build your integration\n\n- Develop your data migration plan, starting with new customers. Your end goal\nis to migrate 100% of new customers, then migrate existing customers.\n- Design a process for customers to update their card information.\n\n## Learn about the migration process\n\n- Review Stripe’s [migration\ndocumentation](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/data-migrations/pan-import).\n- Contact your previous processor to understand their migrations process.\n\n## Plan a migration and connect with an existing processor\n\n- Identify which payment details you want to migrate.\n- Identify which payment methods you want to migrate.\n- Find out how many customer records you want to migrate.\n- Plan a migration timeline that considers your previous processor, your\ncustomer count, and any upcoming deadlines.\n- Send the Stripe Migrations team details about your previous processor, Stripe\naccount number, number of records to be migrated, and types of payment methods\nthat you plan to import.\n\n## The Stripe Migrations team\n\n- Introduce your existing processor to Stripe’s Migrations team.\n- Complete any action items or provide any additional information requested by\nStripe or your existing processor’s migrations team.\n\n## Migrate and update\n\n- Follow communication between Stripe and your previous processor to ensure your\nteam is prepared.\n- Respond to any issues identified during migration.\n- Look for an email from the Stripe Migration team with the JSON mapping file.\n- Parse JSON mapping file and update your database accordingly.\n- Implement a process for customers to update their card information.\n- Design your remapping plan, and include\n[subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating) remapping\nwhere applicable.\n- Begin charging existing customers on Stripe.\n\n## PAN data\n\nIf you need to transfer sensitive payment information to or from another payment\nprocessor, or even between Stripe accounts, we can help you do so in a secure\nand\n[PCI-compliant](https://docs.stripe.com/security/guide#validating-pci-compliance)\nway.\n\nThe process differs depending on the type of transfer:\n\n- [Transfer PAN data from one Stripe account to another Stripe\naccount](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/data-migrations/pan-copy-self-serve)\n- [Import PAN data to Stripe from another payment\nprocessor](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/data-migrations/pan-import)\n- [Export PAN data from Stripe to another payment\nprocessor](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/data-migrations/pan-export)\n\nFor each type of data migration, we can only assist you if your request includes\nboth customer records and the associated payment data. Use Stripe’s [Customer\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers) to create, update, or retrieve\ncustomer data that doesn’t include payment information.\n\n#### Note\n\nYou can perform PAN data migrations without using Stripe’s Sigma or Data\nPipeline products.\n\n## See also\n\n- [The Customer object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object)\n- [The Subscription object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object)\n- [Default payment\nsource](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-default_source)\n- [Products and prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/overview)\n- [Billing cycle\nanchor](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/create#create_subscription-billing_cycle_anchor)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Stripe\nsupport](https://support.stripe.com/contact/login?email=true&subject=Migration+to+Stripe)\n- [migration\ndocumentation](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/data-migrations/pan-import)\n- [subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating)\n-\n[PCI-compliant](https://docs.stripe.com/security/guide#validating-pci-compliance)\n- [Transfer PAN data from one Stripe account to another Stripe\naccount](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/data-migrations/pan-copy-self-serve)\n- [Export PAN data from Stripe to another payment\nprocessor](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/data-migrations/pan-export)\n- [Customer API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers)\n- [The Customer object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object)\n- [The Subscription object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object)\n- [Default payment\nsource](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-default_source)\n- [Products and prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/overview)\n- [Billing cycle\nanchor](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/create#create_subscription-billing_cycle_anchor)",
