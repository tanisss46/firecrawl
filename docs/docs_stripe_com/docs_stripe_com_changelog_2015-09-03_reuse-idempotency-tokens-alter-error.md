# Requests that reuse idempotency tokens but alter request parameters now throw an errorBreaking changes

## What’s new

Returns an error if a request reuses an idempotency token with different
parameters than the original request. Previously, errors were only returned for
reusing the same idempotency token across different API endpoints.

## Impact

An error is now returned for reused idempotency tokens with different
parameters, preventing unintended duplicate requests.
