  "content": "# Launch usage-based pricing models with rate cardsPrivate preview\n\n## Charge customers complex pricing models with rate cards and subscriptions.\n\nYou can use rate cards to offer complex pay-as-you-go pricing models, like:\n\n- **Large number of usage-based prices**: Model hundreds of pay-as-you-go\nusage-based prices and group them into a single rate card. Each price references\na dedicated meter to track customer usage.\n- **Subscribe customers to the rate card**: Subscribe customers to a rate card\nwith many prices in it using a single API call that references the rate card ID.\n- **Launch new rates instantly**: Add new prices for new features to existing\nrate cards and start reporting usage\n[events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/v2/billing-meter). This lets existing\ncustomers use the new feature immediately.\n\n## Before you begin\n\nRate cards are currently in [private\npreview](https://docs.stripe.com/release-phases) and could change in shape and\nintegration path before they’re generally available to all Stripe users.\n\n## Join our private preview for rate cards\n\nIf you're interested in early access to the rate cards private preview, please\nregister your interest below.\n\nCollect EmailSubmitRead our [privacy policy](https://stripe.com/privacy).\n### Limitations\n\n- Rate cards only support usage-based pricing. Additional support for licensed\npricing models is planned.\n- You can only create rate cards for v2 subscriptions.\n- Invoices are limited to 250 line items. Subscriptions with more than 250 line\nitems generate multiple invoices.\n\n## Get started\n\nTo get started with rate cards:\n\n- [Create a rate\ncard](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based/rate-cards#create-card),\nwhich represents a grouping for all of your usage-based prices.\n- [Add prices to the rate\ncard](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based/rate-cards#add-prices).\n- [Set up billing cadence for the\ncustomer](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based/rate-cards#set-up-cadence)\nto define how to invoice your customers on a recurring basis.\n- [Subscribe the customer to the rate\ncard](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based/rate-cards#subscribe-customer)\nby passing in the rate card and the billing cadence.\n- [Start recording customer\nusage](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based/rate-cards#record-usage)\nof your product, then send usage events to Stripe. The customer gets invoiced on\neach cadence.\n- [Launch new\nrates](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based/rate-cards#launch-rates)\nfor new products to existing customers by adding the new price to the rate card.\n\n## How rate cards work\n\nThe following diagram shows core concepts of charging a customer based on usage\nconsumption with rate cards:\n\nCustomer\n\nMeter event\n\nRate Card subscription\n\nInvoice\n\nRate Card\n\nPrice (multiple)\n\nCustomer action generatesSubscribeGeneratesRate usage (price x quantity)Rate\nwith priceHas oneHas many[Create a rate\ncard](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based/rate-cards#create-card)\nProvide an internal name, currency, pricing service interval, and tax behavior\nto create a rate card. The service interval specifies the rate at which a\ncustomer accumulates fees. The billing interval, defined by the [billing\ncadence](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based/rate-cards#set-up-cadence),\ndetermines when the customer is invoiced.\n\n```\ncurl -X POST https://api.stripe.com/v2/billing/rate_cards \\\n -H \"Authorization: Bearer {{YOUR_API_KEY}}\" \\\n -H \"Stripe-Version: 2025-02-24.acacia\" \\\n --json '{\n \"internal_name\": \"PAYGO rate card\",\n \"currency\": \"usd\",\n \"tax_behavior\": \"exclusive\",\n \"service_interval\": \"month\",\n \"service_interval_count\": 1\n }'\n```\n\nAfter you submit the rate card request, Stripe returns the active rate card\nobject. You can’t subscribe new customers to an inactive rate card.\n\n```\n{\n \"id\": \"rcd_test_61RVeJCo447E9aFii16RMt7iESSQdRfzhYKc3x1HkXDM\",\n \"object\": \"billing.rate_card\",\n \"active\": true,\n \"created\": \"2024-11-17T21:49:50.000Z\",\n \"currency\": \"usd\",\n \"internal_name\": \"PAYGO rate card\",\n \"metadata\": {},\n \"service_interval\": \"month\",\n \"service_interval_count\": 1,\n \"latest_version\": \"rcdv_123\",\n \"live_version\": \"rcdv_123\", // defaults to first version created\n \"tax_behavior\": \"exclusive\"\n}\n```\n\n[Add prices to the rate\ncard](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based/rate-cards#add-prices)\nAfter you create a rate card, create your usage-based\n[Price](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/create), and add each price to the\nrate card.\n\n- `recurring.usage_type` must be `metered`.\n- `recurring.meter` must reference a [Meter\nobject](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter/create) to record usage\nevents.\n- `tax_behavior` must match your rate card’s `tax_behavior`.\n- `recurring.interval` must match the `service_interval` of the rate card.\n\nAdd each of your [Prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices) to the rate card\nby using the following API request:\n\n```\ncurl -X POST\nhttps://api.stripe.com/v2/billing/rate_cards/rcd_test_61RVeJCo447E9aFii16RMt7iESSQdRfzhYKc3x1HkXDM/rates\n\\\n -H \"Authorization: Bearer {{YOUR_API_KEY}}\" \\\n -H \"Stripe-Version: 2025-02-24.acacia\" \\\n --json {\"price\":\"{{PRICE_ID}}\"}\n```\n\n#### Price IDs v1\n\nThe Rate Cards API won’t accept [Price IDs\nv1](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/create) after this private preview\nbecomes [generally available](https://docs.stripe.com/release-phases). At that\ntime, this request will require passing the price data directly. Rate card\nbehavior will not change.\n\n[Set up billing cadence for the\ncustomer](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based/rate-cards#set-up-cadence)\nBefore subscribing your customer to the rate card, define when and how often to\ncreate invoices for the customer by creating a billing cadence. When an invoice\nis created, the customer’s default payment method is automatically charged.\n\nTo create a billing cadence, [create a Customer\nobject](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/create). To test your integration\nand advance time, you can [create a test\nclock](https://docs.stripe.com/api/test_clocks/create) and attach it to the\ncustomer.\n\nThe Payer resource represents the entity who pays for each invoice (not\nnecessarily the customer who uses the usage-based rates). To create a payer for\nthe customer, make the following request:\n\n```\ncurl -X POST https://api.stripe.com/v2/billing/payers \\\n -H \"Authorization: Bearer {{YOUR_API_KEY}}\" \\\n -H \"Stripe-Version: 2025-02-24.acacia\" \\\n --json {\"customer\":\"{{CUSTOMER_ID}}\"}\n```\n\nAfter you create a payer, create a billing cadence for them. The `billing_cycle`\ndefines when and how often you automatically bill the payer. When creating a\nbilling cadence, set the exact day and time for invoicing using the following\nAPI request:\n\n```\ncurl -X POST https://api.stripe.com/v2/billing/cadences \\\n -H \"Authorization: Bearer {{YOUR_API_KEY}}\" \\\n -H \"Stripe-Version: 2025-02-24.acacia\" \\\n --json '{\n \"payer\": \"{{PAYER_ID}}\",\n \"billing_cycle\": {\n \"type\": \"month\",\n \"interval_count\": 1,\n \"month\": {\n \"day_of_month\": 20\n }\n }\n }'\n```\n\n[Subscribe the customer to the rate\ncard](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based/rate-cards#subscribe-customer)\nSubscribe your customer to the rate card by passing the rate card and billing\ncadence in the following request. You can optionally pass a specific version of\na rate card when subscribing a customer. If you don’t specify a version, the\nsubscription applies the rate card’s live version.\n\n```\ncurl -X POST https://api.stripe.com/v2/billing/rate_card_subscriptions \\\n -H \"Authorization: Bearer {{YOUR_API_KEY}}\" \\\n -H \"Stripe-Version: 2025-02-24.acacia\" \\\n --json '{\n \"rate_card\": \"rcd_A\",\n \"billing_cadence\": \"bc_1\"\n }'\n```\n\n[Record customer\nusage](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based/rate-cards#record-usage)\nUse [meter events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event) to [record\ncustomer\nusage](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based/recording-usage)\nfor your meter. At the end of the billing period, Stripe bills the reported\nusage to the customer.\n\nTo test usage-based billing, send meter events through the Stripe Dashboard or\nAPI. When using the API, specify the customer ID and usage value in the\n`payload`.\n\n#### Poll meter events before advancing test clocks\n\nAfter sending meter events, wait for [meter event\naggregation](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event-summary) to\ncomplete before advancing your test clock. Poll the meter event summary endpoint\nto confirm your usage has been processed, then advance the test clock to\ngenerate invoices based on the billing cadence.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/billing/meter_events \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d event_name=alpaca_ai_tokens \\\n -d \"payload[stripe_customer_id]\"={{CUSTOMER_ID}} \\\n -d \"payload[value]\"=25\n```\n\n[Launch new\nrates](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based/rate-cards#launch-rates)\nIf you launch a new feature that charges a new fee based on usage, you can\n[create a new Price](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/create) and add that\nprice to your rate card. After adding a new price to the rate card, all existing\ncustomers subscribed to that rate card can start using the feature. To send\nmeter events without updating their rate card subscription, add your new\n[Price](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices) to the rate card:\n\n```\ncurl -X POST https://api.stripe.com/v2/billing/rate_cards/rc_1234/rates \\\n -H \"Authorization: Bearer {{YOUR_API_KEY}}\" \\\n -H \"Stripe-Version: 2025-02-24.acacia\" \\\n --json {\"price\":\"PRICE_ID\"}\n```\n\n## Links\n\n- [events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/v2/billing-meter)\n- [private preview](https://docs.stripe.com/release-phases)\n- [privacy policy](https://stripe.com/privacy)\n- [Price](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/create)\n- [Meter object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter/create)\n- [Prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices)\n- [create a Customer object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/create)\n- [create a test clock](https://docs.stripe.com/api/test_clocks/create)\n- [meter events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event)\n- [record customer\nusage](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based/recording-usage)\n- [meter event\naggregation](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event-summary)",
