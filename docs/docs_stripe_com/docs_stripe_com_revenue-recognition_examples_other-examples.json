All other accounts operate as if the invoice is paid, but the\ncash account doesn’t change. You can import third party transaction data and\nconsolidate all your revenue sources into your Stripe reporting by using the\n[Data Import feature](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/data-import).\n\nThis example involving the external asset account uses the following\nassumptions:\n\n- On January 1, at 00:00:00 UTC, a customer starts a monthly subscription that\ncosts 31 USD.\n- The subscription generates an invoice, and the invoice finalizes on the same\nday.\n- The invoice is manually marked as paid outside of Stripe on February 5.\nAccountJanFebAccountsReceivable+31.00-31.00Revenue+31.00CashExternalAsset+31.00\n## Fees\n\n[Stripe fees](https://stripe.com/en-ca/pricing) are booked against the Fees\naccount on a cash basis.\n\nThis example uses the following assumptions:\n\n- On January 1, at 00:00:00 UTC, a customer starts a three month subscription\nthat costs 90 USD.\n- The subscription generates an invoice.\n- The invoice finalizes and the customer pays 90 USD.\n- This payment has a Stripe processing fee of 0.02 USD.\n\nIf you view the summary after March ends, you’ll see something like this:\n\nAccountJanFebMarRevenue+31.00+28.00+31.00DeferredRevenue+59.00-28.00-31.00Cash+89.98Fees+0.02\n\n## Links\n\n- [Data Import feature](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/data-import)\n- [Stripe fees](https://stripe.com/en-ca/pricing)",
