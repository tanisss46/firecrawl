  "content": "# Getting started with Stripe Apps\n\n## Learn the basics of app development by building, previewing, and updating a Stripe app.\n\nIn this guide, build a “Hello, world!” sample app with a UI extension on the\nCustomer details page in the Stripe Dashboard.\n\n## Before you begin\n\n- If you have an existing [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect) extension,\nsee [Migrate to Stripe\nApps](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/migrate-extension).\n- Sign in to the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/).\n- If you haven’t already, install the Stripe CLI and log in using the same\naccount.\n```\n# Install Homebrew to run this command: https://brew.sh/\nbrew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe\n\n# Connect the CLI to your dashboard\nstripe login\n```\n\nFor additional install options, see [Get started with the Stripe\nCLI](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli).\n- Verify that you’re using CLI version 1.12.4 or newer. You can check by\nrunning:\n```\nstripe version\n```\n\nIf your Stripe CLI version is older than 1.12.4, [update your Stripe CLI version\nto the latest version](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli/upgrade).\n- Verify that node is installed and up to date.\n```\nnode -v\n```\n\nYou can manage your app’s dependencies with NPM or Yarn. Use the latest stable\nversion for the best development experience. If you plan to [publish your app to\nthe App Marketplace](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/publish-app), there are\nadditional restrictions:\n- Your account must be\n[activated](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/activate).\n- Currently to publish an app on the Stripe Marketplace, you can’t be a Platform\naccount.\n[Install the Stripe Apps CLI\nplugin](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/create-app#install-stripe-apps-cli)\nTo start building a Stripe app, install the Stripe Apps CLI plugin:\n\n```\nstripe plugin install apps\n```\n\nIf you already have the `apps` plugin installed, verify that you’re on version\n`1.5.12` or later.\n\n```\nstripe apps -v\n# apps version 1.5.12\n```\n\nIf you need to upgrade the `apps` plugin, you can run:\n\n```\nstripe plugin upgrade apps\n```\n\n[Create an app](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/create-app#create-app)-\nBuild the basic structure of your “Hello, world!” app:\n\n```\nstripe apps create helloworld\n```\n- Follow the prompts by entering the following information:\n\n- **ID**: You can accept the auto-generated app ID or customize one. This is how\nStripe identifies your app. Your [app\nID](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/reference/app-manifest#schema) must be\nglobally unique.\n- **Display name**: Enter a display name. This is the name your Dashboard\ndisplays for your app. You can always change the name later.\n\n### Your directory file structure is now:\n\nStripe Apps only supports React 17. Make sure any dependency you install is\ncompatible with this version. For more information see [How UI extensions\nwork](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/how-ui-extensions-work#apps-cant-control-the-react-version).\n\n[Preview your app](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/create-app#preview-app)\nYou can run your app locally, update it, and preview your changes in the\nDashboard:\n\n- Go into the `helloworld` directory:\n\n```\ncd helloworld\n```\n- To preview your app, start your local development server:\n\n```\nstripe apps start\n```\n- Press **Enter** to open your browser.\n\n#### Note\n\nUse a [browser that supports the Stripe\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/dashboard/basics). Safari doesn’t support the\nDashboard. For more updates, see the [GitHub issue tracking browser\nsupport](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-apps/issues/146).\n- Click **Continue** to preview your app in your Stripe account:\n\n![Screenshot of enabling preview\nmode](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/enable_app_preview.7d71712d107d581e0a25a4ebaf71484e.png)\n\nEnable app preview\n\n![Hello World\napp](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/helloworld_app.7b1588ce22f93f72ab2ecd07c44dd041.png)\n\nYour app in the Dashboard\n\nThe `App` view only renders on the Customer details page in the Dashboard. If\nyou don’t see your app, make sure you [create a customer in the\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/customer).\n\n[Build your app](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/create-app#build-app)\nWhile you’re previewing your app in the Dashboard, the local development server\nenables real-time updates on your app:\n\n- In your `App.tsx` file, change the title while you keep the Stripe Dashboard\npage open and your development server running. Save the file to see your changes\nin your app.\n- In the same file, remove `>` from the `</ContextView>` closing tag, and save\nthe file to see an error:\n\n![Hello World\nerror](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/helloworld_error.ee7aeea9d33b54f1e17b108f61741e97.png)\n\nYou can resolve the error in the Stripe Dashboard, your browser developer tools,\nor the Stripe CLI.\n- To stop the development server, **Ctrl+C** from your command line.\n\nYour sample app is complete. Next, start adding more features to your Stripe\napp.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Build a UI extension](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/build-ui)\n- [Add server-side logic](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/build-backend)\n- [Distribution\noptions](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/distribution-options)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)\n- [Migrate to Stripe\nApps](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/migrate-extension)\n- [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/)\n- [https://brew.sh/](https://brew.sh/)\n- [Get started with the Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli)\n- [update your Stripe CLI version to the latest\nversion](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli/upgrade)\n- [publish your app to the App\nMarketplace](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/publish-app)\n- [activated](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/activate)\n- [app ID](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/reference/app-manifest#schema)\n- [How UI extensions\nwork](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/how-ui-extensions-work#apps-cant-control-the-react-version)\n- [browser that supports the Stripe\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/dashboard/basics)\n- [GitHub issue tracking browser\nsupport](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-apps/issues/146)\n- [create a customer in the\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/customer)\n- [Build a UI extension](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/build-ui)\n- [Add server-side logic](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/build-backend)\n- [Distribution\noptions](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/distribution-options)",
