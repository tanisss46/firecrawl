  "content": "# Perform searches in the Dashboard\n\n## Use the Dashboard to search for payments, customers, and more.\n\nUse the Dashboard’s built-in search feature to find important resources and\nnavigate across different Stripe resources, like [connected\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect),\n[Coupons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/coupons),\n[Customers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers),\n[Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices) (and [Invoice\nItems](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoiceitems)),\n[Payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts), and\n[Products](https://docs.stripe.com/api/products). When you perform a search, the\ntop results appear immediately. View all of the matches by clicking **Show all\nresults for** or pressing **Enter**. From the resulting groups of search\nresults, click **View all** to see an expanded display with column headings,\nsome of which provide sorting options.\n\n![Dashboard's search suggested\nfilters](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/dashboard-search.bc1d683e4a7eca1a760873ab03b03aae.png)\n\nUse suggested filters when searching\n\n## Get started\n\nUse different pieces of information as search terms:\n\n- The last four digits of a card (**4242**).\n- The payment method type (**iDEAL**).\n- The business name of a connected Stripe account (**Rocketship**).\n- The email receipt number (**1817-9523**).\n\nFor searches that require dates, you can use different formats, like **08/22**,\n**2020-07-12**, or **last week**. Use object identifiers (dispute ID) to take\nyou directly to the object you’re looking for. No additional context is\nnecessary for most searches. The Dashboard automatically looks for the most\nrelevant information based on your search query. You can make use of search\nfilters and operators for more granular control.\n\n## Search filters and operators\n\nBy default, the Dashboard looks for values that match your search term in the\nmost logical fields within objects. (For example, it’ll look for an email\naddress in the `email` field or an object description.) You can use filters and\noperators to further refine your searches. The more terms you provide in your\nsearch query, the fewer the number of results.\n\nFiltersOperators\nUse filters to limit your search terms so that they only apply to specific\nfields within applicable objects. Preface a search term with one of these\nfilters. If your search term must include a space, wrap it in quotation marks\n(`name:\"John Doe\"`). Many fields are shared across different objects. For\ninstance, the `amount` field applies to payments, invoices, payouts, and so on.\n\nFilterDescriptionExample`amount:`The amount of an object. For decimal\ncurrencies, use a decimal point for both currency units (for example, dollars\nand cents).amount:149.99`brand:`The brand of card associated with an\nobject.brand:visa`country:`The two-letter [ISO\ncode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1) representing the country\nassociated with an object.country:GB`created:`The date an object was created\n(identical to `date`).created:2020/07/12`currency:`The three-letter [ISO\ncode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) representing the currency of an\nobject.currency:EUR`date:`The date an object was created (identical to\n`created`).date:yesterday`email:`The email (either full address or part of one)\nof an object.email:jenny.rosen@example.com`exp:`The expiration date of the card\nassociated with an object.exp:08/22`flow:`The type of [flow for customer\naction](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#flow-for-customer-action) that applies\nto a [Sources](https://docs.stripe.com/sources) payment.flow:redirect`last4:`The\nlast four digits of the card associated with an\nobject.last4:4080`metadata:`[Metadata](https://docs.stripe.com/api#metadata)\nvalue on a supported object. Additional [search\noptions](https://docs.stripe.com/dashboard/search#metadata-searches) for\nmetadata are also available.metadata:555-5555`name:`The cardholder or customer\nname associated with an object.name:jenny`number:`The unique number identifying\nan invoice.number:06b2b1a642-0023`postal:`The ZIP or postal code associated with\nan object.postal:12345`receipt:`The receipt number used in a payment or refund\nemail receipt.receipt:3330-2392`risk_level:`The [risk\nlevel](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/risk-evaluation) of a payment determined by\n[Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar).risk_level:elevated`status:`The status of\nan object.status:canceled`type:`The type of\n[PaymentMethod](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods) or\n[Source](https://docs.stripe.com/sources) used to create a\npayment.type:ideal`usage:`The\n[usage](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#single-use-or-reusable) availability of\na [Sources](https://docs.stripe.com/sources) payment\nmethod.usage:single_use`zip:`The ZIP or postal code associated with an\nobject.zip:12345\n### Combine and negate search terms\n\nUse more than one search term to narrow down your search and reduce the number\nof results. You can also negate any search filter with a hyphen (`-`) so that\nmatches for it aren’t included.\n\nExampleDescription`last4:4242 exp:08/22`The last four digits of the card are\n`4242` and expiration date is `08/22`.`last4:4242 -exp:08/22`The last four\ndigits of the card are `4242` and expiration date is not `08/22`.`type:ideal\nstatus:canceled`iDEAL payments where the source has been canceled and not used\nto complete a payment.\nTo search for an entire phrase, use quotation marks. For example, **“Stripe\nShop”** provides matches for that full phrase, but **Stripe Shop** searches the\nwords **Stripe** and **Shop** separately.\n\n### Metadata searches\n\nYou can search for [metadata](https://docs.stripe.com/api#metadata) that you\nadded to objects that support it. For example, you can find documents that have\nmetadata key `order_id` with corresponding metadata value `xyn712` using any of\nthe following search queries:\n\n- `xyn712`\n- `order_id:xyn712`\n- `metadata:xyn712`\n- `metadata:order_id=xyn712`\n\n## Search across accounts in an organization\n\nAfter you add multiple Stripe accounts to an\n[organization](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/orgs), users can\nsearch across all accounts they have access to within that organization.\n\nBy default, searches display results from all accounts you have access to in the\norganization. To narrow your search to within your current account, select the\naccount dropdown to the right of the search bar in the Dashboard.\n\n![Search across the organization or current\naccount.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/org-search.ad9ff17e4e187a926dd0d12f0dcecda9.png)\n\nSearch across the organization by default or narrow your searches to your\ncurrent account.\n\nWhen you search within an organization, both the dropdown search results and the\nfull results page display the associated account for each result.\n\n![Organization-wide search\nresults](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/org-search-results-dropdown.f05bff944bdf38d6ed06e4a4d2e7953a.png)\n\nSearch results in the dropdown display the associated account for each result.\n\n## Best practices\n\nMany searches can be performed with a single search term. Use something that\nwould be fairly specific, such as a name or email address. If you’re seeing too\nfew results, make the search term less specific. If there are too many results,\ninclude additional terms, one at a time.\n\nUse a wider range of values when using dates or amounts as search terms.\nCurrency conversions and time zone differences between you and your customer are\na common source of confusion when looking up information about a payment. In\nthese cases, additional search terms or even different ones altogether can help.\n\n#### Bookmark searches\n\nAs search terms are included in the URL, you can bookmark the search or share it\nwith other team members as you would any other web page.\n\n## Links\n\n- [connected accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)\n- [Coupons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/coupons)\n- [Customers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers)\n- [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n- [Invoice Items](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoiceitems)\n- [Payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts)\n- [Products](https://docs.stripe.com/api/products)\n- [Stripe Sigma](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data)\n- [ISO code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1)\n- [ISO code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217)\n- [flow for customer\naction](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#flow-for-customer-action)\n- [Sources](https://docs.stripe.com/sources)\n- [Metadata](https://docs.stripe.com/api#metadata)\n- [risk level](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/risk-evaluation)\n- [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar)\n- [PaymentMethod](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods)\n- [usage](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#single-use-or-reusable)\n- [organization](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/orgs)",
