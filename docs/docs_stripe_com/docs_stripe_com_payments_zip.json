After payment terms\nacceptance, Zip transfers funds to your Stripe account up front and your\ncustomer repays Zip over time according to their agreement terms.\n\nPayment method propertiesBusiness locationsProduct support- **Customer\nlocations**\n\nAustralia, United States Beta\n- **Presentment currency**\n\nAUD, USD Beta\n- **Payment confirmation**\n\nCustomer-authenticated\n- **Payment method family**\n\nBuy now, pay later\n- **Recurring payments**\n\nNo\n- **Payout timing**\n\nStandard\n- **Connect support**\n\nYes\n- **Dispute support**\n\n[Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/zip#disputes-and-fraud)\n- **Manual capture support**\n\nNo\n- **Refunds / Partial refunds**\n\n[Yes / Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/zip#refunds)\n\n## Interested in getting early access to Zip in the US?\n\nIn the United States, Zip is currently in private preview. If you're interested\nin trying it out, enter your email address below.\n\nCollect EmailSign upRead our [privacy policy](https://stripe.com/privacy).\n## Payment flow\n\nBelow is a demonstration of the Zip payment flow from your checkout page:\n\nThis demo shows the customer experience when using Zip.\n\n## Get started\n\nYou don’t have to integrate Zip and other payment methods individually. If you\nuse our front-end products, Stripe automatically determines the most relevant\npayment methods to display. Go to the [Stripe\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and enable\nZip. To get started with one of our hosted UIs, follow a quickstart:\n\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart): Our prebuilt, hosted\ncheckout page.\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart): Our drop-in UI\ncomponents.\n\n### Other payment products\n\nThe following Stripe products also let you add Zip from the Dashboard:\n\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n\nIf you prefer to manually list payment methods, learn how to [manually configure\nZip as a payment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/zip/accept-a-payment).\n\n## Payment options\n\nAvailable payment options vary by country. In Australia, Zip offers Zip Pay and\nZip Money, which have flexible repayment plans. In the US, Zip offers a Pay in 4\nplan that splits repayment into 4 installments over 6 weeks. Regardless of the\npayment option selected, Stripe makes the full amount of the funds (minus fees)\navailable to you upfront and Zip collects the purchase amount from your\ncustomer, who repays Zip directly.\n\n- [Zip Pay](https://zip.co/au/zip-pay): A line of credit up to 1000 AUD.\nCustomers can select their repayment frequency, either weekly, bi-weekly, or\nmonthly. Zip charges customers a monthly account fee, but waives it if the\nbalance is repaid in full.\n- [Zip Money](https://zip.co/au/zip-money): A line of credit between 1000 AUD\nand 5000 AUD, and potentially up to 50,000 AUD. Customers can adjust the\ninstallment period with no interest for 3-36 months, depending on the retailer.\nIf you want to offer your customers interest-free repayment periods longer than\n3 months, or credit limits higher than 5000 AUD, [contact Stripe\nsupport](https://support.stripe.com/contact/email?question=other&topic=payment_apis&subject=ZipPayments&refcode=yN2i).\nZip charges customers an account establishment fee and a monthly fee, but waives\nthe monthly fee when the account balance is zero.\n- [Zip pay-in-4](https://zip.co/us/how-it-works): Customers pay for purchases\nover 4 installments. Zip [adds a finance\ncharge](https://help.us.zip.co/hc/en-us/articles/4402386045979--Are-there-any-fees-to-use-Zip)\nbased on the purchase amount, and splits the total amount into 4 equal\ninstallments. Customers pay the first installment at time of purchase, then make\nthe 3 remaining repayments at 2-week intervals.\n\nThe following table lists total transaction limits, currency and payment options\nby country:\n\nStripe account and customer countryCurrencyTransaction limitsZip Pay Zip Money\nZip pay-in-4 AustraliaAUD1 - 50,000* United States BetaUSD35 - 1,500\n* If the purchase amount is greater than their available credit, customers can\npay the rest with cards up front.\n\n## Prohibited business categories\n\nIn addition to standard [Stripe business\nrestrictions](https://stripe.com/legal/restricted-businesses), some other\nbusiness categories are prohibited from accepting Zip payments through Stripe,\ndepending on your country.\n\nFor detailed information, see Zip prohibited and restricted business information\nfor [Australia](https://help.zip.co/hc/en-us/articles/6544802536591) and the\n[United\nStates](https://merchant-help.us.zip.co/hc/en-us/articles/12709915538971-Prohibited-and-Restricted-Business-Information).\n\n## Add Zip branding to your website\n\nZip works closely with partners to test and enhance the way Zip is presented to\ncustomers. Their integration and marketing requirements aim to benefit\nbusinesses by converting more browsers into shoppers and increasing average\nbasket sizes. You must use and display Zip’s branding according to their\nguidance, which varies by country:\n\n- Australia: See [best practice\nintegration](https://developers.zip.co/docs/best-practice-implementation) guide\nand [static visual assets and branding\nguidelines](https://developers.zip.co/docs/zip-marketing-assets).\n- United States: See [marketing\nguidelines](https://zip.co/us/merchant-resources)\n\n## Disputes\n\nCustomers must authenticate Zip payments by logging into their Zip account. This\nrequirement helps reduce the risk of fraud or unrecognized payments. While Zip\ncovers losses incurred from customer fraud, Stripe might contact you on behalf\nof Zip and request to stop or pause shipment before any losses are incurred.\nComply promptly with these requests.\n\nCustomers can dispute Zip payments in certain cases—for example, if they receive\nfaulty goods or don’t receive them at all. Customers have up to 180 calendar\ndays from the date of purchase to file a dispute.\n\nIn Australia, Zip requires customers to first contact you directly to resolve a\ndispute. If, after 14 days from the date of purchase, that doesn’t resolve it,\nthe customer can initiate a dispute case with Zip.\n\nStripe notifies you of a dispute using:\n\n- Email\n- Stripe Dashboard\n- An API `charge.dispute.created` event (if your integration is set up to\nreceive [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks))\n\nStripe holds back the disputed amount from your balance until Zip resolves the\ndispute.\n\nStripe requests that you upload compelling evidence that you fulfilled the\npurchase order [using the Stripe\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/responding#respond). This evidence\ncan include:\n\n- Received return confirmation (for shipped goods returned from the customer to\nyou)\n- Tracking ID\n- Shipping date\n- Record of purchase for intangible goods, such as an IP address or email\nreceipt\n- Record of purchase for services or physical goods, such as a phone number or\nproof of receipt\n\nIf you would rather handle disputes programmatically, you can [respond to\ndisputes using the API](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/api).\n\nThis information helps Zip determine if a dispute is valid or if they need to\nreject it. Make sure the evidence you provide contains as much detail as\npossible from what the customer provided at checkout. If Zip resolves the\ndispute with you winning, Stripe returns the disputed amount and dispute fee to\nyour Stripe balance. If Zip rules in favor of the customer, the balance charge\nbecomes permanent.\n\n## Refunds\n\nPayments made with Zip can only be submitted for refund within 180 calendar days\nfrom the date of the original charge. After 180 days, it’s no longer possible to\nrefund the charge.\n\n## Additional requirements\n\n**You acknowledge that:**\n\n- Zip decides if customers can use Zip for purchases and has the sole right to\nreceive payment from Zip customers. Stripe acquires those purchases for you and\nsettles the funds to you.\n- You must not process a Zip transaction unless delivery will be completed\nwithin 60 days.\n- You must retain information about each Zip transaction for at least 18 months.\n- You can’t give return credits in cash unless required by law.\n- You can’t impose fees or higher prices for Zip purchases (that is, no\nsurcharging).\n- If a customer has questions about how Zip handles their information, you will\nrefer them to Zip’s privacy policy.\n\n**If you’re in the United States, you acknowledge that:**\n\n- All goods and services for Zip transactions must be located in the United\nStates.\n- Zip can’t be used to pay for a gift card, gift voucher, prepaid stored value\ncard, or prepaid stored value voucher.\n- Transactions must be recorded in US dollars.\n- Zip or its lending partner may extend credit to Zip customers for a fee.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Zip](https://zip.co/)\n- [authorize](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#customer-actions)\n- [Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/zip#disputes-and-fraud)\n- [Yes / Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/zip#refunds)\n- [privacy policy](https://stripe.com/privacy)\n- [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods)\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart)\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart)\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n- [manually configure Zip as a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/zip/accept-a-payment)\n- [Zip Pay](https://zip.co/au/zip-pay)\n- [Zip Money](https://zip.co/au/zip-money)\n- [contact Stripe\nsupport](https://support.stripe.com/contact/email?question=other&topic=payment_apis&subject=ZipPayments&refcode=yN2i)\n- [Zip pay-in-4](https://zip.co/us/how-it-works)\n- [adds a finance\ncharge](https://help.us.zip.co/hc/en-us/articles/4402386045979--Are-there-any-fees-to-use-Zip)\n- [Stripe business restrictions](https://stripe.com/legal/restricted-businesses)\n- [Australia](https://help.zip.co/hc/en-us/articles/6544802536591)\n- [United\nStates](https://merchant-help.us.zip.co/hc/en-us/articles/12709915538971-Prohibited-and-Restricted-Business-Information)\n- [best practice\nintegration](https://developers.zip.co/docs/best-practice-implementation)\n- [static visual assets and branding\nguidelines](https://developers.zip.co/docs/zip-marketing-assets)\n- [marketing guidelines](https://zip.co/us/merchant-resources)\n- [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks)\n- [using the Stripe\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/responding#respond)\n- [respond to disputes using the API](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/api)",
