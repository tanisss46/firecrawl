For example, if you\nhave the domain **yourdomain.com** and subdomains like **shop.yourdomain.com**\nand **www.yourdomain.com**, this guide explains how to register them.\n\nAfter you register a domain, that domain is ready for use with other payment\nmethods that you might enable in the future.\n\nThe following payment methods require registration:\n\n- Google Pay\n- Link\n- PayPal\n- Amazon Pay\n- Apple Pay\n\n#### Apple Pay and merchant validation\n\nThe Apple Pay documentation describes their process of “merchant validation,\"\nwhich Stripe handles for you behind the scenes. You don’t need to create an\nApple Merchant ID or CSR. Instead, follow the steps in this guide.\n\n## Testing\n\nYou also need to register domains for testing. When testing locally, you can use\na tool such as [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to get an HTTPS domain. You can\neither register in test mode, or register in live mode and the domain will also\nbe registered in test mode automatically. Remember to register your domains in\nlive mode before going live.\n\nDashboardAPI\nYou can create and manage domains in the Dashboard on the [Payment method\ndomains page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_method_domains) for\nuse in production and testing.\n\n#### Using Connect\n\nConnect platforms that create direct charges must use the API to manage domains\nfor their [connected\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/pmd-registration#register-a-domain-using-connect),\nnot the Stripe Dashboard.\n\n## Register your domain\n\nTo register a domain:\n\n- On the [Payment method domains\npage](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_method_domains), click **Add\na new domain**.\n- Enter your domain name.\n- Click **Save and continue**.\n- (Optional) Repeat steps 1-3 for additional domains that you need to register.\n\nAfter completing these steps, your domain shows up on the Payment method domains\npage.\n\n### Using an iframe\n\n- **Using an iframe with Elements**: When using an iframe, its origin must match\nthe top-level origin (except for Safari 17+ when specifying `allow=\"payment\"`\nattribute). Two pages have the same origin if the protocol, host (full domain\nname), and port (if specified) are the same for both pages.\n- **Top-level domain and iframe domain**: If the top-level domain differs from\nthe iframe domain, the top-level domain and the iframe’s source domain must both\nbe registered payment method domains on the associated account.\n\n## Manage your domain\n\nYou can see a list of all of your domains in the Dashboard.\n\nTo disable a domain, click the row action and then click **Disable**. If a\ndomain is disabled, the payment methods no longer appear in Elements or\nCheckout’s embeddable payment form on that domain.\n\nTo enable a disabled domain, click the row action and then click **Enable**.\n\n## Register your domain while using Connect\n\nConnect platforms must register all domains where Elements or Checkout’s\nembeddable payment form displays the payment methods listed above. The domain\nwhere the charge is being run needs to be registered for the user running the\ncharge.\n\nIf the platform creates [direct\ncharges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges), use your platform’s\nsecret key to authenticate the request and set the Stripe-Account header to your\nconnected account’s Stripe ID.\n\nIf the platform creates [destination\ncharges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges) or [separate\ncharges and\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers), use\nyour platform’s secret key to authenticate the request and omit the\nStripe-Account header.\n\nLearn more about [Making API calls for connected\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/authentication).\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_method_domains \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -H \"Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}\" \\\n -d domain_name=\"example.com\"\n```\n\n## Links\n\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements)\n- [Checkout’s embeddable payment\nform](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/how-checkout-works?payment-ui=embedded-form)\n- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)\n- [Payment method domains\npage](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_method_domains)\n- [direct charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges)\n- [destination charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges)\n- [separate charges and\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n- [Making API calls for connected\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/authentication)",
