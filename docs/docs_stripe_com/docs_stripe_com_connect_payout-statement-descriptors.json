  "content": "# Payout statement descriptors\n\n## Understand and manage how Stripe payouts look on a connected account's bank statements.\n\nThe statement descriptor used for Connect payouts varies according to the\nproperties of the connected account and the conditions of the payout. There is a\nprecedence order used for\n[manual](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/payout-statement-descriptors#manual-payouts)\nand\n[automatic](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/payout-statement-descriptors#automatic-payouts)\npayouts.\n\nConnected accounts can have a customized statement descriptor stored on the\nAccount object at\n[settings.payout.statement_descriptor](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-settings-payouts-statement_descriptor).\n\n## Default statement descriptor\n\nConnect platforms can configure a platform-wide default statement descriptor in\ntheir [Connect\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/payouts/statement-descriptor),\nwhich is also used under certain criteria. Even when the precedence order falls\nto it, the default statement descriptor configured in your platform’s [Connect\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/payouts/statement-descriptor)\nonly applies to a connected account’s payout under certain criteria.\n\n- The connected account belongs to a platform that pays Stripe fees (including\nCustom and Express accounts), or you have [platform\ncontrols](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/platform-controls-for-stripe-dashboard-accounts)\nfor it.\n- The connected account doesn’t have access to the Stripe API. Connected\naccounts only have access to the Stripe API if they can access the Stripe\nDashboard.\n- The connected account isn’t restricted from using the `read_write` OAuth\nscope. Connected accounts can use the `read_write` OAuth scope if they have\naccess to the Stripe Dashboard and aren’t explicitly restricted from using it\nwith platform controls.\n\nUnless all of these criteria apply, the statement descriptor defaults to STRIPE.\nHowever, this default might be subject to other external factors, such as which\nbank processed the payout.\n\n## Precedence order\n\nThe precedence order for the statement descriptor is different for manual and\nautomatic payouts.\n\n### Manual payouts\n\n- The\n[statement_descriptor](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payouts/object#payout_object-statement_descriptor)\nset on the Payout object.\n- The\n[settings.payout.statement_descriptor](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-settings-payouts-statement_descriptor)\nfrom the connected account, if your platform and the connected account were\ncreated on or after October 9th, 2023.\n- Your platform’s default statement descriptor, if it’s applicable to the\nconnected account.\n- If no other conditions are met, the statement descriptor might default to\nSTRIPE.\n\n### Automatic payouts\n\n- The\n[settings.payout.statement_descriptor](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-settings-payouts-statement_descriptor)\nfrom the connected account, if your platform and the connected account were\ncreated on or after October 9th, 2023.\n- Your platform’s default statement descriptor, if it’s applicable to the\nconnected account.\n- If no other conditions are met, the statement descriptor might default to\nSTRIPE.\n\n## Links\n\n-\n[settings.payout.statement_descriptor](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-settings-payouts-statement_descriptor)\n- [Connect\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/payouts/statement-descriptor)\n- [platform\ncontrols](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/platform-controls-for-stripe-dashboard-accounts)\n-\n[statement_descriptor](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payouts/object#payout_object-statement_descriptor)",
