Read more about\nregistering for [sales tax in the US in our\nguide](https://stripe.com/guides/sales-tax-registration-process-us).\n\nRemote sellers with no physical presence in Texas can register for the [Single\nLocal Use Tax\nrate](https://comptroller.texas.gov/taxes/sales/remote-sellers.php). This\nelection (the process of making your choice known to the state) allows you to\ncollect a single local use tax rate in the state. You can collect this tax rate\nafter notifying the [Texas\nComptroller](https://comptroller.texas.gov/taxes/sales/forms/index.php).\n\nAfter you’ve registered to collect tax in Texas, go to\n[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations?location=us-tx)\nto add your registrations to Stripe in the Dashboard. This turns on tax\ncalculation and collection in Stripe for your transactions in Texas. You’ll be\nable to indicate which tax election you made in Texas as part of adding your\nregistration to Stripe.\n\nLearn [how to add your\nregistration](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/registering#track-your-registrations-in-the-tax-dashboard)\nin the Dashboard.\n\n## How we calculate taxes\n\nIf your [origin address](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/set-up#origin-address) is\nin the US and differs from your customer’s state, Stripe always calculates tax\nbased on your customer’s location.\n\nIf your customer is in Texas and your origin address is also in Texas, Stripe\napplies tax based on your origin address, depending on the type of product or\nservice you sell.\n\nStripe calculates the appropriate tax rate for your registration. If you\nselected the Single Local Use Tax rate in Stripe then we will calculate and\ncollect the simplified rate. You can change this by [editing the tax\nregistration](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/registering#edit-a-registration) on\nthe **Dashboard**.\n\n## Report and file your taxes\n\nStripe provides reports of your completed tax transactions. Go to\n[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations) to access these\nreports.\n\n### Exports\n\nThe tax transaction data export provides a comprehensive and aggregated view of\ntransactions by location, including a breakdown of individual tax amounts. Learn\nmore about [tax reporting exports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports#exports).\n\n### Location reports\n\n[Location reports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports#us-location-reports)\noffer a summary of transaction and refund data for specific US locations and\nalign with Texas filing requirements. You have the option to report on an\nannual, quarterly, or monthly basis.\n\nReporting-specific considerations:\n\n- If you chose to collect the Single Local Use Tax, you’ll see ‘Single Local\nTax’ on your report instead of any local jurisdictions.\n\n### Filing\n\nStripe Tax has filing partners—Taxually, Marosa, and Hands-off Sales Tax\n(HOST)—to help automate your tax filing. These partners automatically sync your\ntax transaction data in real time, eliminating the need for manual data entry or\nfile transfers.
