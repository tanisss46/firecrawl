  "content": "# Link with Checkout\n\n## Use Link with Stripe's prebuilt checkout page.\n\nCheckout is a [prebuilt payment form](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout)\nthat you can embed on your site or use as a Stripe-hosted payment page. Use Link\nwith Checkout to allow your customers to securely save and reuse their payment\ninformation. For logged-in customers already using Link, it autofills this\ninformation regardless of whether they initially saved it on a different\nbusiness’s checkout page.\n\nCheckout supports Link with no additional fees, and the same\n[pricing](https://stripe.com/pricing) applies as for other card payments. For\ninformation about how your payment integration affects Link, see [Link in\ndifferent payment\nintegrations](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/link-payment-integrations).\n\n![Add Link to your prebuilt checkout\npage](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/link-in-checkout.2eb9f8d06da3dca74af9b81fa7524049.png)\n\nAdd Link to your prebuilt checkout page\n\n## Before you begin\n\nBuild an integration to [accept a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?integration=checkout)\nusing Checkout.\n\n[Enable Link in\nCheckout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/checkout-link#accept-a-payment)\nAccept payments with Link using information your customer stores in the [Link\napp](https://link.com/). When you receive a payment from a customer using Link\nin Checkout, the `payment_method.type` listed for the payment is `link`. To add\nLink to your [Checkout\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?integration=checkout),\ncreate a Checkout Session with `link` as a payment method type.\n\nUse dynamic payment methodsManually list payment methods\nUse [dynamic payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/dynamic-payment-methods)\nto increase conversion by showing the most relevant payment methods to your\ncustomers. If you collect card details for [future usage with Setup\nIntents](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-and-reuse), list payment methods\nmanually instead of using dynamic payment methods.\n\nTo add Link as a payment method:\n\n- Enable the Link payment method from your [payment method\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods).\n- If you have an existing integration that manually lists payment methods,\nremove the\n[payment_method_types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-payment_method_types)\nparameter from your integration.\n\n![Preview of Link enabled as payment method in the Stripe\nDashboard](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/enable-link-stripe-dashboard.1bd2411da48c323997c27a6dabee9b4c.png)\n\nLink enabled as a payment method in the Stripe Dashboard\n\nAfter you remove the `payment_method_types` parameter from your integration,\nsome payment methods turn on automatically, including cards and wallets. The\ncurrency parameter restricts the payment methods that the customer sees during\nthe checkout session.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/checkout/sessions \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d \"line_items[0][price_data][unit_amount]\"=2000 \\\n -d \"line_items[0][price_data][product_data][name]\"=T-shirt \\\n -d \"line_items[0][price_data][currency]\"=usd \\\n -d \"line_items[0][quantity]\"=1 \\\n -d mode=payment \\\n --data-urlencode success_url=\"https://example.com/success\" \\\n --data-urlencode cancel_url=\"https://example.com/cancel\"\n```\n\n[Test the\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/checkout-link#web-test-the-integration)\n#### Caution\n\nDon’t store real user data in [sandbox](https://docs.stripe.com/sandboxes) Link\naccounts. Treat them as if they’re publicly available, because these test\naccounts are associated with your publishable key.\n\nCurrently, Link only works with credit cards, debit cards, and qualified US bank\naccount purchases. Link requires [domain\nregistration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/pmd-registration).\n\nYou can create sandbox accounts for Link using any valid email address. The\nfollowing table shows the fixed one-time passcode values that Stripe accepts for\nauthenticating sandbox accounts:\n\nValueOutcomeAny other 6 digits not listed belowSuccess000001Error, code\ninvalid000002Error, code expired000003Error, max attempts exceeded\n### Multiple funding sources\n\nAs Stripe adds additional funding source support, you don’t need to update your\nintegration. Stripe automatically supports them with the same transaction\nsettlement time and guarantees as card and bank account payments.\n\n## Link for Connect platforms\n\nLink is automatically available to any connected account that uses Checkout\nthrough a Connect platform integration.\n\n- If you’re a Connect platform, you can manage Link for your platform account\nthrough [Link settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/link) in your\nDashboard. Your connected accounts manage Link from within their own Dashboard\nsettings.\n- If you’re a connected account processing payments through a Connect platform,\nyou can manage Link for both payments processed through a platform and payments\nprocessed without a platform in your Link settings in the Dashboard.\n\n## Disable Link\n\nYou can disable Link in the Stripe Dashboard [payment method\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods). You must\nchange the settings for Link individually for each [payment method\nconfiguration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-method-configurations).\n\nAfter you disable Link for a payment method configuration, the change might take\na few minutes to take effect on your website.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Stripe Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout)\n- [How Checkout\nworks](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/how-checkout-works)\n- [Quickstart](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n- [prebuilt payment form](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout)\n- [pricing](https://stripe.com/pricing)\n- [Link in different payment\nintegrations](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/link-payment-integrations)\n- [accept a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?integration=checkout)\n- [Link app](https://link.com/)\n- [dynamic payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/dynamic-payment-methods)\n- [future usage with Setup\nIntents](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-and-reuse)\n- [payment method\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods)\n-\n[payment_method_types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-payment_method_types)\n- [https://example.com/success](https://example.com/success)\n- [https://example.com/cancel](https://example.com/cancel)\n- [sandbox](https://docs.stripe.com/sandboxes)\n- [domain\nregistration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/pmd-registration)\n- [Link settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/link)\n- [payment method\nconfiguration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-method-configurations)\n- [How Checkout\nworks](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/how-checkout-works)\n- [Quickstart](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart)",
