The process of installing\nthe Stripe App and acquiring the newly generated secret and publishable\n[keys](https://docs.stripe.com/keys) is essential for your integration with the\nPrestaShop Commerce connector. This approach eliminates the need to manually\ncreate your own restricted key or use a secret key. To integrate the PrestaShop\nCommerce app and reinforce your account’s security infrastructure:\n\n- Navigate to the [Stripe App Marketplace](https://marketplace.stripe.com/),\nthen click [Install the PrestaShop Commerce\napp](https://marketplace.stripe.com/apps/install/link/com.stripe.PrestaShop.commerce).\n- Select the Stripe account where you want to install the app.\n- Review and approve the app permissions, install the app in test mode or live\nmode, then click **Install**.\n- After you install the app, store the keys in a safe place where you won’t lose\nthem. To help yourself remember where you stored it, you can [leave a note on\nthe key in the\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#reveal-an-api-secret-key-live-mode).\n- Use the newly generated publishable key and secret key to finish the Connector\nconfiguration.\n- To manage the app or generate new security keys after installation, navigate\nto the application settings page in [test\nmode](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/apps/com.stripe.PrestaShop.commerce)\nor [live\nmode](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/apps/com.stripe.PrestaShop.commerce).\n\n## Connect to Stripe to accept payments\n\nConnect PrestaShop to your Stripe account to start accepting payments.\n\n- On the **Stripe Configure** page, click **Connect with Stripe**.\n- Navigate to the **Stripe Configure** page in the PrestaShop Dashboard, then\npaste the key from the Stripe PrestaShop app into the appropriate field.\n\n## Choose your payment form\n\nConfigure the payment form that displays to your customers during checkout.\nUnder **Payment form settings**, you can choose from the following:\n\n- **Integrated payment form**–The [Payment\nElement](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element) is an embeddable UI\ncomponent that lets you accept 25+ payment methods with a single integration.\n\n![Integrated payment form with Payment\nElement](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/connector_payment_form_element.92e9bda6d112030dee8cd68a9af2a9eb.png)\n\n- **Redirect to Stripe**–[Stripe\nCheckout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout) lets you redirect your\ncustomers to a Stripe-hosted, customizable checkout page to finalize payment.\n\n![Stripe-hosted checkout\npage](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/connector_payment_form_checkout.d40ed334159b3a72be24b0f86bbbb376.png)\n\n## Customize the payment form\n\n- Click the **Integrated payment form** radio button to expose the customization\noptions.\n- Choose a [layout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element#layout) for\nthe **Integrated payment form**:- **Accordion with radio buttons**\n- **Accordion without radio buttons**\n- **Tabs**\n- Choose where to position the payment form:- **On top of the Shopware payment\nmethods**\n- **At the bottom of the Shopware payment methods**\n- **With the Shopware payment methods**\n- Choose a prebuilt theme that most closely resembles your website:- **Stripe**\n- **Flat**\n- **Night**\n- **None**\n\nYou can also [customize the look and feel of\nCheckout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/customization) (**Redirect\nto Stripe**).\n\n## Express Checkout Element\n\nExpress Checkout Element allows you to display one-click payment buttons with\nLink, Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal, and Amazon Pay.\n\nStripe sorts the payment buttons dynamically based on customer location,\ndetected environment, and other optimized conversion factors.\n\nOn the backoffice, you can customize Express Checkout Element after you check\n**Enable Express Checkout**.\n\n- Specify where to display the one-click payment buttons:- On the **Product\nPage**\n- On the **Shopping Chart Page**\n\n![Express checkout at product\nlevel](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/express-checkout-product.2e598dada8a10ad85b1478d6327e3c96.png)\n\n![Express checkout at cart\nlevel](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/express-checkout-cart.5b7dbd005bbdd03688f74b9e63f0fd48.png)\n- Choose different button themes and button types for Apple Pay, Google Pay and\nPayPal.\n\nBoth logged in and guest users can purchase through the Express Checkout\nbuttons. Guest users will be able to enter their address through the payment\ninterface.\n\n## Collect your customer’s postal code\n\nYou can specify whether or not to collect your customer’s postal code at\ncheckout using the **Never collect the postal code** field.

For\nexample, you can use `Shipped` as the catch status. The capture occurs\nautomatically when the status changes.\n\nIf the capture is unsuccessful, the status changes to the specified value in the\n**Transition to the following order status if the authorization expires before\nbeing captured** field.\n- In the Stripe Dashboard, under **Payments**, select **All payments**. On the\n**Uncaptured** tab, select the order and then click **Capture**.\n\n## Save customer payment methods\n\nYou can let customers save their payment details for faster checkout on future\npurchases by enabling the **Save payment methods at customer level** option. If\nnot selected, customers can still use Link to save their payment methods\nglobally.\n\n## Choose when the order is created\n\nYou can specify when to create the order during the payment process using the\n**Payment Flow** field:\n\n- (Recommended) **Create the order after the payment is initiated**: Creates the\norder when the customer clicks the **Place Order** button.\n- (Legacy, not recommended) **Create the order after the payment is confirmed**:\nCreates the order after Stripe validates the payment.\n\n## Refunds\n\nTo refund a payment, you need the Stripe Payment ID for the order.\n\n- In the PrestaShop dashboard, under **Orders**, select **Orders**.\n- Find the order you want to refund and copy the **Payment ID** under\n**Stripe**.\n- To initiate a full or partial refund, do the following:\n\n- Go to the **Refund** tab on the **Stripe payment module**.\n- In the **Stripe Payment ID** field, paste the payment ID.\n- Select **Full refund** or **Partial refund**.
