Join [Stripe\nInsiders](https://insiders.stripe.dev/c/sandboxes/6), our new early access\nprogram, to register your interest in joining the Sandboxes private preview.\nEmail us at\n[sandboxes-feedback@stripe.com](mailto:sandboxes-feedback@stripe.com) with\nfeedback about Sandboxes.\n\nA sandbox is an isolated test environment. You can use your sandbox to test\nStripe functionality in your account, and experiment with new features without\naffecting your live integration. For example, when testing in a sandbox, the\npayments you create aren’t processed by card networks or payment providers.\n\n## Use cases\n\nScenarioDescriptionSimulate Stripe events to test without real money movementUse\nyour sandbox to test payments functionality without real money movement. Create\npayments in your business account to accumulate a fake balance or use test\nhelpers to simulate external events.Scale isolated sandboxes for teamsYour team\ncan [test in separate\nsandboxes](https://docs.stripe.com/sandboxes/dashboard/manage#create-a-sandbox)\nto make sure that data and actions are completely isolated from other sandboxes.\nChanges made in one sandbox don’t interfere with changes in another.Invite\nexternal users[You can invite another\nuser](https://docs.stripe.com/sandboxes/dashboard/manage-access#grant-users-access-to-a-specific-sandbox),\nsuch as implementation partner or design agency, to access all sandboxes, or a\nspecific sandbox, without providing them access to your live mode data.Test in\nthe Dashboard or the CLIAccess your sandbox from the Dashboard or the [Stripe\nCLI](https://docs.stripe.com/cli-preview-plugin). Test Stripe functionality\ndirectly in the Dashboard or use familiar CLI commands and\n[fixtures](https://docs.stripe.com/cli/fixtures).\n## Manage sandboxes in the Dashboard\n\nTo access sandboxes, click **Sandboxes** within the Dashboard account picker.\nDepending on your permissions, you can view, create, delete, and open sandboxes\nfrom the sandboxes overview page. To manage user access and API keys for a\nspecific sandbox, first open the sandbox and then manage those settings directly\nwithin the sandbox.\n\n## Test in a sandbox\n\nYou can simulate payments and use test cards to test your integration without\nmoving money.
