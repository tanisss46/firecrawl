Card brand filtering lets you specify\nallowed or disallowed card brands for:\n\n- The credit card form in the Mobile Payment Element\n- The cards buyers can use with Google Pay.\n\nWhen you configure the Mobile Payment Element, you can specify one of two\noptions:\n\n- `allowed`: Accept only the card brands you specify.\n- `disallowed`: Accept all card brands except those you specify.\n\nFor either of these options, pass an array with any of the following card brand\nvalues as defined on `PaymentSheet.CardBrandAcceptance.BrandCategory`:\n\n- `Visa`\n- `Mastercard`\n- `Amex`\n- `Discover`\n\n#### Note\n\nThe `Discover` value encompasses all of the cards that are part of the Discover\nGlobal Network, including Discover, Diners Club, JCB, UnionPay, and Elo.\n\nThis guide demonstrates how to use card brand filtering to only accept card\npayments from Visa and Mastercard branded cards.\n\n## Before you begin\n\n- [Create a Stripe account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register) or [sign\nin](https://dashboard.stripe.com/login).\n- Follow the steps in [Accept in-app\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/mobile/accept-payment) to integrate\nwith the Mobile Payment Element.\n[Filter card\nbrands](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/mobile/filter-card-brands#card-brand-filtering-android)\nWhen you create your `PaymentSheet.Configuration` object, specify the card\nbrands you want to allow or disallow using the `cardBrandAcceptance` property.\nThis example shows how to allow only Visa and Mastercard:\n\n```\nimport com.stripe.android.paymentsheet.PaymentSheet\n\nclass CheckoutActivity : AppCompatActivity() {\n\n private fun onPayClicked(\n paymentSheet: PaymentSheet,\n paymentIntentClientSecret: String,\n ) {\nval configuration = PaymentSheet.Configuration.Builder(merchantDisplayName =\n\"Example, Inc.\")\n .cardBrandAcceptance(\n PaymentSheet.CardBrandAcceptance.allowed(\n listOf(\n PaymentSheet.CardBrandAcceptance.BrandCategory.Visa,\n PaymentSheet.CardBrandAcceptance.BrandCategory.Mastercard\n )\n )\n )\n .build()\n\n // Present Payment Sheet\npaymentSheet.presentWithPaymentIntent(paymentIntentClientSecret, configuration)\n }\n}\n```\n\n[Test your\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/mobile/filter-card-brands#testing-android)\nStripe provides a set of [test card\nnumbers](https://docs.stripe.com/testing#cards) that you can use to test your\ncheckout flow and verify that the Mobile Payment Element accepts or blocks your\ndesired card brands.\n\n![The Mobile Payment Element when a card brand is\ndisallowed](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/filter-card-brands-android.fb9f9a9aa83ea4848db35adbaca08e7a.png)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Mobile Payment\nElement](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements/mobile-payment-element)\n- [Create a Stripe account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register)\n- [sign in](https://dashboard.stripe.com/login)\n- [Accept in-app\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/mobile/accept-payment)\n- [test card numbers](https://docs.stripe.com/testing#cards)",
