  "content": "# Using Connect with Express connected accounts\n\n## Express connected accounts enable your platform to manage payout schedules, customize the flow of funds, and control branding. Stripe handles onboarding, account management, and identity verification.\n\n## Express demo\n\nTo see the complete Express onboarding flow in action, try the [sample\nend-to-end Express integration](https://rocketrides.io/) before you start\nbuilding your own. This demo includes an example of a connected account\nonboarding experience and account management for Rocket Rides, an on-demand\nmarketplace.\n\nYou can find the demo’s [complete source\ncode](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-connect-rocketrides) on GitHub.\n\n![Rocket Rides, a demo of Stripe Connect with Express connected\naccounts](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/rocket-rides-new.e01ced22698d7f5d3d1c915f26175dcd.png)\n\n## Before you begin\n\nTo create Express connected accounts, you must meet all of these requirements:\n\n- **Minimum API version**: Express connected accounts require API version\n2017-05-25 or later.\n[Capabilities](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities) require API\nversion 2019-02-19 or later.\n- **Platform in a supported country**: Platforms in Australia, Austria, Belgium,\nBrazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia,\nFinland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan,\nLatvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand,\nNorway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden,\nSwitzerland, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United States can create\nExpress accounts for most countries [Stripe\nsupports](https://stripe.com/global). For information about country-specific\nrestrictions, or to request notification when Express accounts become available\nin your country, [contact us](mailto:connect@stripe.com).\n- **Countries that don’t support self-serve**: Due to restrictions that apply\nwhen using Connect in the [United Arab\nEmirates](https://support.stripe.com/questions/connect-availability-in-the-uae)\nand\n[Thailand](https://support.stripe.com/questions/stripe-thailand-support-for-marketplace),\nplatform users in these countries can’t self-serve Express connected accounts.\nTo begin onboarding for Express connected accounts in these countries, [contact\nus](https://stripe.com/contact/sales).\n- **Platforms in the UAE**: Platforms in the UAE can only use Express connected\naccounts based in the UAE with the following charge types:\n[destination_charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges) and\n[separate charges and\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers).\nDestination charges using the\n[on_behalf_of](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-on_behalf_of)\nattribute are not yet supported for UAE platforms.\n- **Vetting for fraud**: Because your platform is responsible for losses\nincurred by Express connected accounts, you must closely examine all accounts\nthat sign up through your platform for potential fraud. Refer to our [risk\nmanagement best practices\nguide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/risk-management/best-practices#fraud) for\nmore information.\n- **Platform profile**: You need to complete your [platform’s\nprofile](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/registration).\n\n## Onboarding Express connected accounts outside of your platform’s country\n\nYou can enable onboarding on a per-country basis in the [Connect\nSettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/applications/settings) section of\nyour Dashboard.\n\nThe Express account onboarding flow is currently localized in , French,\nSpanish, Bulgarian, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Czech, Danish,\nDutch, Estonian, Finnish, German, Greek, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian,\nJapanese, Latvian, Lithuanian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Slovak,\nSlovenian, Swedish, and Thai.\n\nKeep the following in mind when onboarding accounts globally:\n\n- **International business:** Your platform is responsible for understanding the\nimplications of doing business internationally, such as tax and financial\nreporting.\n- **Charge flows:** Be sure to review your options for [creating\ncharges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges) based on the countries you\nintend to operate in.\n- **Service agreement type:** Your platform can create connected accounts under\nthe [recipient service\nagreement](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/service-agreement-types#recipient) to\nenable [cross-border\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities#transfers-cross-border).\nSuch accounts have restricted access to capabilities.\n[Configure the onboarding\nexperience](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/express-accounts#configure-onboarding)\nBefore onboarding your first account, go to the [Connect settings\npage](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/applications/settings) to customize\nthe visual appearance of the form with your brand’s name, color, and icon.\nConnect Onboarding requires this information.\n\n[Create an Express connected account and prefill\ninformation](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/express-accounts#create-account)\nUse the [Create Account](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/create) API to\ncreate a connected account with `type` set to `express`. You can prefill any\ninformation, but at a minimum, you must specify the `type`. The country of the\naccount defaults to the same country as your platform, and the account confirms\nthe selection during onboarding.\n\n#### Note\n\nThis example includes only some of the fields you can set when creating an\naccount. For a full list of the fields you can set, such as `address` and\n`website_url`, see the [Create Account API\nreference](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/create).\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d type=express\n```\n\nIf you know the country and\n[capabilities](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities) for your\nconnected account, you can provide that information when you create the account.\nConnect Onboarding then collects the requirements for those capabilities. To\nreduce onboarding effort, request only the capabilities you need.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d country=US \\\n -d type=express \\\n -d \"capabilities[card_payments][requested]\"=true \\\n -d \"capabilities[transfers][requested]\"=true \\\n -d business_type=individual \\\n --data-urlencode \"business_profile[url]\"=\"https://example.com\"\n```\n\nIf you’ve already collected information for your connected accounts, you can\nprefill that information on the `Account` object. You can prefill any account\ninformation, including personal and business information, external account\ninformation, and so on.\n\nConnect Onboarding doesn’t ask for the prefilled information. However, it does\nask the account holder to confirm the prefilled information before accepting the\n[Connect service\nagreement](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/service-agreement-types).\n\nWhen you onboard an account without its own website and your platform provides\nit with a personal URL, prefill its `business_profile.url`. If the account\ndoesn’t have a URL, you can prefill its `business_profile.product_description`\ninstead.\n\nWhen testing your integration, prefill account information using [test\ndata](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/testing).\n\nIf you omit `capabilities`, Connect Onboarding uses the settings in the\n[Configuration\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/applications/settings/express)\nsection of the Stripe Dashboard to automatically request capabilities based on\nthe account’s country.\n\n[Create an account\nlink](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/express-accounts#create-link)\n[Create an Account Link](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links/create) with\nthe following parameters:\n\n- `account` - use the account ID returned by the API from the previous step\n- `refresh_url`\n- `return_url`\n- `type` = `account_onboarding`\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/account_links \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d account={{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}} \\\n --data-urlencode refresh_url=\"https://example.com/reauth\" \\\n --data-urlencode return_url=\"https://example.com/return\" \\\n -d type=account_onboarding\n```\n\n[Redirect your account to the account link\nURL](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/express-accounts#redirect-link)\nAn [Account Link](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links/object) contains a\n`url`. Redirect the account to this link to send your account into the\nonboarding flow. Each [Account Link](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links)\nURL can only be used once because it grants access to the account holder’s\npersonal information. Authenticate the account in your application before\nredirecting them to this URL.\n\nBefore creating the first account link for an Express connected account, prefill\nany [Know Your\nCustomer](https://support.stripe.com/questions/know-your-customer) (KYC)\ninformation. After you create an account link for an Express connected account,\nyou can’t read or update its KYC information.\n\n#### Security tip\n\nDon’t email, text, or otherwise send account link URLs outside of your platform\napplication. Instead, provide them to the authenticated account holder within\nyour application.\n\n[Handle the connected account returning to your\nplatform](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/express-accounts#return-user)\nConnect Onboarding requires you to pass both a `return_url` and `refresh_url` to\nhandle all cases where the connected account is redirected to your platform.\nIt’s important that you implement these correctly to provide the best experience\nfor your connected account.\n\n#### Note\n\nYou can use HTTP for your `return_url` and `refresh_url` while in test mode (for\nexample, to test with localhost), but live mode only accepts HTTPS. Be sure to\nswap testing URLs for HTTPS URLs before going live.\n\n#### return_url\n\nStripe issues a redirect to this URL when the connected account completes the\nConnect Onboarding flow. This doesn’t mean that all information has been\ncollected or that there are no outstanding requirements on the account. This\nonly means the flow was entered and exited properly.\n\nNo state is passed through this URL. After a connected account is redirected to\nyour `return_url`, check the state of the `details_submitted` parameter on their\naccount by doing either of the following:\n\n- Listen to `account.updated` events with a [Connect\nwebhook](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/webhooks).\n- [Retrieve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/retrieve) the account with the\nAPI.\n\n#### refresh_url\n\nYour connected account is redirected to the `refresh_url` in these cases:\n\n- The link is expired (a few minutes passed after the link was created).\n- They already visited the URL (they refreshed the page or clicked back or\nforward in the browser).\n- Your platform can no longer access the account.\n- The account has been rejected.\n\nSet up your `refresh_url` to trigger a method on your server to call [Account\nLinks](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links) again with the same\nparameters, and redirect the connected account to the Connect Onboarding flow to\ncreate a seamless experience.\n\n[Handle connected accounts that have not completed\nonboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/express-accounts#handle-users-not-completed-onboarding)\nA connected account that’s redirected to your `return_url` might not have\ncompleted the onboarding process.\n[Retrieve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/retrieve) their account and\ncheck for `charges_enabled`. If the account isn’t fully onboarded, provide UI\nprompts to allow them to continue onboarding later. They can complete their\naccount activation through a new account link (generated by your integration).\nYou can check the state of the `details_submitted` parameter on their account to\nsee if they’ve completed the onboarding process.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Express Dashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/express-dashboard)\n- [Integrate the Express\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/integrate-express-dashboard)\n- [Customize the Express\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/customize-express-dashboard)\n\n## Links\n\n- [sample end-to-end Express integration](https://rocketrides.io/)\n- [complete source code](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-connect-rocketrides)\n- [Capabilities](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities)\n- [Stripe supports](https://stripe.com/global)\n- [United Arab\nEmirates](https://support.stripe.com/questions/connect-availability-in-the-uae)\n-\n[Thailand](https://support.stripe.com/questions/stripe-thailand-support-for-marketplace)\n- [contact us](https://stripe.com/contact/sales)\n- [destination_charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges)\n- [separate charges and\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n-\n[on_behalf_of](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-on_behalf_of)\n- [risk management best practices\nguide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/risk-management/best-practices#fraud)\n- [platform’s profile](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/registration)\n- [Connect Settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/applications/settings)\n- [creating charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges)\n- [recipient service\nagreement](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/service-agreement-types#recipient)\n- [cross-border\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities#transfers-cross-border)\n- [Create Account](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/create)\n- [https://example.com](https://example.com)\n- [Connect service\nagreement](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/service-agreement-types)\n- [test data](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/testing)\n- [Configuration\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/applications/settings/express)\n- [Create an Account Link](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links/create)\n- [https://example.com/reauth](https://example.com/reauth)\n- [https://example.com/return](https://example.com/return)\n- [Account Link](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links/object)\n- [Account Link](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links)\n- [Know Your Customer](https://support.stripe.com/questions/know-your-customer)\n- [Connect webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/webhooks)\n- [Retrieve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/retrieve)\n- [Express Dashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/express-dashboard)\n- [Integrate the Express\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/integrate-express-dashboard)\n- [Customize the Express\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/customize-express-dashboard)",
