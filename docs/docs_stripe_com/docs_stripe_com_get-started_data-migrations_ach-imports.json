  "content": "# Import ACH data\n\nWhen migrating ACH data from your previous processor, we can import the ACH\nrecords into Stripe using the default bank account (`ba_`) object or a payment\nmethod (`pm_`) object representation.\n\nBefore the first charge with ACH direct debit, a business must get permission\nfrom the customer to debit their bank account by presenting a mandate to the\ncustomer. To import ACH records as `pm_` objects, we need your confirmation that\nyou hold mandates for the bank accounts you’re importing. If you’re unsure,\nconsult with your previous payment service provider. If you don’t hold the\nmandates, we import the ACH records with the `ba_` object representation.\n\nAfter determining mandate status for all, some, or none of the bank accounts,\ninform us. Based on your response, we’ll then provide instructions on the next\nsteps you need to take.\n\n## ACH validation status\n\nYou must confirm the WEB debit accounts’ validation status by choosing one of\nthe options below:\n\n- **All** WEB debit accounts were **debited** before the Nacha WEB Debit Account\nValidation Rule took effect on March 19, 2022.\n- **All** WEB debit accounts have been **validated** according to Nacha’s Web\nDebit Account Validation rule by your previous payment service provider.\n- **Some** WEB debit accounts were debited before Nacha’s WEB Debit Account\nValidation Rule became effective on March 19, 2022, or complied with the rule\nthrough your previous provider. You must provide a list of validated and\nnon-validated records.\n- **None** of the WEB debit accounts were processed before the effective date of\nthe Nacha WEB Debit Account Validation Rule on March 19, 2022, nor successfully\nvalidated by your previous provider. Stripe must validate these accounts. (An\ninstant verification fee applies per bank account validation.)\n\n## How it works\n\n![Shows the ACH record import process\n](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/dm-ach.6b9d5e4b6efa67df8e0fa76331a1e904.jpg)\n\n## ACH emails\n\nIn our [intake form](https://support.stripe.com/contact/email?topic=migrations),\nchoose whether to import the mandates as bank account (`ba_`) or payment method\n(`pm_`) objects.\n\n- If you choose bank accounts, we don’t notify your customers about the\nmigration.\n- If you choose payment methods and provide customer emails, we’ll automatically\nsend your customers an email to confirm the mandate in accordance with Nacha\nrequirements after the import. Your customers don’t need to do anything after\nreceiving the emails.\n\n## ACH file guidance\n\n- A processor can provide a number of different fields.\n- We advise your processor to provide a full export of all customer and payment\nmethod data to Stripe.\n- Stripe can filter out any unnecessary fields from the previous processor’s\ndata as needed.\n- Stripe can merge multiple received files if either the old customer ID or the\nold source ID is present in both files.\n\n### File formatting requirements\n\nExport data files must meet the following data standards for us to proceed with\nan import:\n\n- The file must be in CSV format.\n- The file must be UTF-8 encoded.\n- Delimit rows by a single newline character `\n` (not `\\r\n`).\n- Delimit columns by `,`\n- You must wrap all fields containing commas in double quotes `\"`. We recommend\nwrapping all fields in double quotes.\n- Leave empty fields entirely empty (no character in between delimiters). You\nmust *not* denote a missing field with `NULL`, `N/A`, or any other value.\n- Escape any double quotes that are part of the content with another double\nquote per the CSV RFC. For example: `\"``William` `\"\"``Bard of Avon``\"\"`\n`Shakespeare``\"`\n- Fields can’t contain newline characters (`\\r` or `\n`) within a field. Example of what to avoid: `101 1st Ave\nApt 1`\n- All rows must have the same number of columns.\n- Columns support any order.\n- You must encrypt sensitive data files with our [PGP\nkey](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/data-migrations/pan-import#migration-pgp-key)\nbefore submitting through SFTP.\n\n## ACH data fields\n\nFieldRequiredAdditional infoOld customer IDRequiredWe create a customer ID for\neach unique old customer ID provided.Routing numberRequiredMust be 9 digits in\nlength and include leading zeros.Account numberRequiredMost bank account numbers\nhave between 8 and 12 digits, though they can range from 5 to 17 digits.Account\nholder typeRequiredSpecifies `individual` or `company` as the type of\nbusiness.Account typeRequiredSpecifies a `checking` or `savings` account.\nUnspecified account are imported as `checking`.Account nameRequiredFirst and\nlast name of account holder or company name.EmailOptional*Additional metadata\n*If importing ACH records as payment methods and providing customer emails,\nwe’ll automatically send your customers an email to confirm the mandate in\naccordance with Nacha requirements after the import.
