The thresholds exclude sales of services.\n\n### Other taxes\n\nWe also support:\n\n- [Kentucky State and Local Communications\nTax](https://revenue.ky.gov/Business/Telecommunications-Tax/Pages/default.aspx)—for\nbusinesses selling video streaming to customers in Kentucky. This includes the\nMulti Channel Video Programming Excise Tax and Utility Gross Receipts License\nTax. These taxes only apply when your business has physical presence in\nKentucky. This means there isn’t a revenue threshold for when remote sellers\nneed to pay this tax. Transactions for these taxes aren’t included in Stripe\nmonitoring for Kentucky. The linked page is only accessible within the US or via\na VPN.\n\n## Register to collect tax\n\nRegister for tax in Kentucky at the [tax\nauthority](https://onestop.ky.gov/start/Pages/statetax.aspx).
