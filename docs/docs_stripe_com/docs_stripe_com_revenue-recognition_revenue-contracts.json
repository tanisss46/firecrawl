It allows you to\ncustomize revenue schedules using custom performance obligations that are\ndecoupled from billing periods. Additionally, you can track key metrics at a\ncontract level and improve your financial insights.\n\n## Customize revenue schedules\n\nRevenue contracts enables the creation of custom contract items that dictate how\nrevenue is recognized instead of invoice line items. It allows you to attach\nbilling models (for example, invoices, subscriptions, payments) to the contract\nused as payment collection containers.\n\n### Example\n\nGiven a 2-year B2B contract with monthly billing, you can create a contract item\nfor the 2-year period:\n\nContract\nItemAmount10000[Price](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices)price_1PeriodJan 1,\n2022 - Jan 1, 2024\nYou can then attach a transaction/billing model to the contract to be used for\npayment allocation:\n\nBilling ModelTypesub_sched_1[Subscription\nSchedule](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscription_schedules)\nGiven this contract setup, Revenue Recognition can augment reports by\nincorporating non-GAAP accounts like contract assets and deferred revenue. In\nturn, this enables us to elevate our metrics as the contract undergoes monthly\nbilling.\n\n## Track contract-level metrics\n\nWhen you open up a revenue contract in Revenue Recognition, you can track\nhigh-level metrics across a group of contract items and transactions such as:\n\n- Total contract value\n- Annual contract value\n- Billing to date\n- Revenue to date\n- Future schedule billings\n- Unbilled deferred revenue\n\n## Integration\n\n### Salesforce CPQ Connector\n\nYou can import all your orders and contracts generated in Salesforce using the\n[Stripe Billing Connector for Salesforce\nCPQ](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/salesforce-cpq/overview). When this\nconnection is set up, you can manage Stripe Billing subscriptions and revenue\ncontracts associated with your Salesforce orders.\n\n### API Private preview\n\nYou can create and manage revenue contracts through an API integration.\n\n[Contact us](mailto:revrec-revenue-contracts-beta-submissions@stripe.com) to\nparticipate in the private preview.\n\n## Links\n\n- [privacy policy](https://stripe.com/privacy)\n- [Revenue Recognition](https://dashboard.stripe.com/revenue-recognition)\n- [Price](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices)\n- [Subscription Schedule](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscription_schedules)\n- [Stripe Billing Connector for Salesforce\nCPQ](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/salesforce-cpq/overview)",
