Disputes, also called chargebacks, can result in significant costs. Verifi, a
Visa solution, helps you save on dispute costs while lowering your dispute rates
and automating part of your dispute management process.

Use dispute prevention to:

- Set rules to automatically refund specific disputes with Rapid Dispute
Resolution (RDR). Refunded disputes don’t count towards your dispute rate and
don’t incur a dispute fee.
- Prevent disputes by sending extra transaction data with Order Insight (OI).
- Block disputes entirely if the extra transaction data provided with OI is
Compelling Evidence (CE 3.0) eligible.

You can review and manage dispute prevention from the Dashboard. Learn more
about [disputes and fraud](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes).

## Benefits

Automatically refunding disputes can cost less than responding to certain
disputes. If you’re part of the Visa Dispute Monitoring Program (VDMP) or the
Visa Acquirer Monitoring Program (VAMP), then automatically refunding disputes
can help you exit the program. Learn more about [monitoring
programs](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/monitoring-programs).

**Lower dispute rates**

Automatically refunded disputes don’t count towards your dispute rate.

**Zero integration required**

Stripe integrates directly with Verifi and provides your existing transaction
data on your behalf at time of lookup.

**Lower costs**

Fewer disputes means fewer dispute fees and operational costs.

## How it works

### Order Insight

Order Insight uses your transaction data to help cardholders recognize the
charge. When eligible, adding Compelling Evidence 3.0 can block disputes
entirely.

### Rapid Dispute Resolution

Rapid Dispute Resolution automatically refunds disputes based on your custom
rules. These disputes don’t count towards your overall dispute rate.
