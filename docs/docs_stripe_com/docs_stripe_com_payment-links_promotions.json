Customers can enter\nthese codes on their payment page to apply discounts on their purchases.\n\nCreate a promotion code in the\n[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/coupons/create) by creating a coupon\nand then turning it into a customer-facing promotion code. Use the\n`prefilled_promo_code` [URL\nparameter](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links/customize#customize-checkout-with-url-parameters)\nto prefill a promotion code when sharing a payment link. Learn more about how to\ngenerate [promotion codes for\nCheckout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/discounts#create-a-promotion-code).\n\n#### Note\n\nBy default, payment links create [guest\ncustomers](https://support.stripe.com/questions/guest-customer-faq) for one-time\npayments. As a result, promotion codes that are only eligible for first-time\norders won’t work as expected.\n\n## Increase revenue potential with subscription upsells\n\n[Subscription upsells](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/upsells) give\ncustomers the option to upgrade to a longer-term plan during checkout, such as\nprogressing from monthly to yearly. This strategy might enhance your average\norder value and improve your cash flow.\n\nYou can configure a subscription upsell in the Dashboard on the **Price detail**\npage. You can view the details for a price by clicking on one you’ve added to a\nproduct. You’ll see a list of eligible upsell prices in the dropdown menu. After\nyou select an upsell, it immediately applies to eligible payment links that use\nthat price.\n\nTo set up a subscription upsell:\n\n- Choose a subscription under\n[Subscriptions](https://dashboard.stripe.com/subscriptions), navigate down to\n**Pricing**.\n- Use the overflow menu to select **View price details**.\n- Navigate down to Upsells, and in the **Upsells to** dropdown menu, select or\nadd a price.\n\n!\n\n## Offer optional items\n\nYou can offer up to 10 optional items on your payment link. Optional items allow\nyour customers to purchase additional products before checking out. You can\noffer multiple products, and specify initial or adjustable quantity.\n\nCustomers can add optional items to their order during checkout.\n\n### Dashboard\n\nWhen you [create a payment\nlink](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payment-links/create) in the Stripe\nDashboard, you can click **+ Add recommended products** to add up to 10 optional\nproducts to the payment link.\n\n### Add a product-associated optional item\n\nUse [cross-sells](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/cross-sells) to\nspecify complementary products that you always want recommended as optional\nitems at checkout. When you configure a cross-sell associated with a product,\nthe optional item appears across all eligible payment links with that product.\nCross-sells won’t appear if you specify additional optional items on a payment\nlink.\n\nTo configure a cross-sell:\n\n- On the [Product catalog](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products) page,\nselect your product.\n- On the product details page, under **Cross-sells**, find the product you want\nto cross-sell.\n\nAfter you configure a cross-sell, the payment links that contain your designated\nproduct automatically add the cross-sell as an optional item.\n\n## Links\n\n- [create a payment link](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payment-links/create)\n- [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/coupons/create)\n- [URL\nparameter](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links/customize#customize-checkout-with-url-parameters)\n- [promotion codes for\nCheckout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/discounts#create-a-promotion-code)\n- [guest customers](https://support.stripe.com/questions/guest-customer-faq)\n- [Subscription upsells](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/upsells)\n- [Subscriptions](https://dashboard.stripe.com/subscriptions)\n- [cross-sells](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/cross-sells)\n- [Product catalog](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products)",
