  "content": "# Map to your chart of accounts\n\n## Map transactions from the Stripe default accounts to the chart of accounts in your general ledger.\n\nYou can customize Stripe Revenue Recognition reporting to use your General\nLedger (GL) chart of accounts instead of using the default [Stripe\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/methodology). You can\nconfigure a rule to map transactions by product, shipping region, or invoice\nmetadata to your GL account. Stripe applies your custom mappings to the [CSV\nreports](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/reports#csv-reports) you\ndownload and also when you [audit your revenue\nnumbers](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/reports/audit-numbers). A\nmapping rule consists of the following:\n\nMapping rule attribute DescriptionStripe accountThe [Stripe default\naccount](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/methodology#chart-of-accounts)\nthat you want to override.GL accountThe name of the GL account you want to\noverride the Stripe account with.GL account numberThe number corresponding to\nthe GL account.\nEffective period\n\nThe time period the mapping applies to.\n\nAn [invoice line item](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/line_item) fulfills\nthe effective period requirement if the finalization time of the invoice is\nwithin the specified effective period.\n\nA [charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges) fulfills the effective period\nrequirement if the balance transaction it corresponds to has a creation time\nthat’s within the specified effective period.\n\nConditionAn optional criteria to map transactions by product, shipping region,\nor invoice metadata. If not specified, all transactions involving the configured\nStripe account are mapped to the GL account.\nStatus\n\n**Active**: The mapping rule is active and all transactions are mapped as per\nthe rule.\n\n**Processing**: The rule is processing. On completion, the rule is active and\ntransactions are mapped accordingly.\n\n## Configuring a mapping rule\n\nMapping rule configuration is a 4-step process—click the add mapping button on\nthe accounts mapping page to begin.\n\n- **Select Stripe account**: Select the default Stripe account from the dropdown\nfor which you want to create the rule.\n- **Select GL account**: You can select your GL account from the dropdown or add\none if you can’t find it in the dropdown. When setting up the rules for the\nfirst time, you have to add these accounts by specifying the GL account name and\nnumber. You have to specify at least a name or a number to add the account.\n- **Specify effective period**: The effective period is the time frame in which\nthe mapping rule is applicable. Select a start and end date from the dropdown to\nconfigure the effective period. If you specify an effective period that overlaps\nwith closed accounting periods, you’ll see corrections in your report in the\ncurrent open accounting period. You can reopen the past accounting periods\ncorresponding to the effective period to avoid corrections.\n- **Specify mapping condition (optional)***: You can optionally specify a\nmapping condition on any of the following attributes:- **Product**: If you have\nproduct specific accounts in your GL, you can classify your transactions based\non the products that you have configured in the Stripe Dashboard.\n- **Shipping region**: Similar to products, you can specify the shipping region\nto map transactions to the relevant GL account. Only ISO-compliant country and\nstate codes are supported.\n- **Invoice metadata**: You can configure a custom rule using invoice metadata\nif your GL accounts don’t track transactions by product or shipping region.\nCreate a rule by selecting a key and adding a value. The keys are from metadata\nyou created in past invoices.**\n\nClick **Map accounts** to create the mapping rule and for Stripe to [process the\ndata](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/methodology#data-availability).\nThe rule’s status changes to active when the data processing is complete, and\nyou can then download reports with the mapped GL accounts.\n\n## Mapping rule configuration example\n\nThe following example involves 3 different products:\n\n- Product A: Annual subscription cost of 1,200 USD\n- Product B: Annual subscription cost of 2,400 USD\n- Product C: Annual subscription cost of 3,600 USD\n\nIf you sell 1 subscription each for A, B, and C in January, your journal entry\nat the end of the month appears as follows without account mapping:\n\nAccountJanuaryRevenue+600 USDDeferred Revenue+6600 USD\nHowever, the user has 3 separate revenue accounts in its GL, say revenue_A,\nrevenue_B, and revenue_C for tracking revenue corresponding to these 3 products.\nThe user has to do manual work to identify revenue in these accounts before\nposting to its GL.\n\nIf you have product-specific accounts in your General Ledger that you want to\nmap to, you can create 3 mapping rules:\n\nStripe accountGL account numberGL accountConditionEffective\nperiodRevenue10001revenue_AProduct AJan 2023 -\nIndefiniteRevenue10002revenue_BProduct BJan 2023 -\nIndefiniteRevenue10003revenue_CProduct CJan 2023 - Indefinite\nAfter you set up these rules, your journal entries will contain three line items\nreflecting the revenue distribution for each product. This can help you\nstreamline the process of posting to your GL.\n\nGL account numberAccountJanuary1001revenue_A+100 USD1002revenue_B+200\nUSD1003revenue_C+300 USD-Deferred Revenue+6600 USD\n* For a default Stripe account, you can only pick one attribute to create a\nrule.
