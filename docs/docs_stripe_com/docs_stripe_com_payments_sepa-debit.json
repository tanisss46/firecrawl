  "content": "# SEPA Direct Debit payments\n\n## Learn about Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) Direct Debit, a common payment method in the European Union.\n\nThe [Single Euro Payments Area\n(SEPA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Euro_Payments_Area) is an\ninitiative of the European Union to simplify payments within and across member\ncountries. They established and enforced banking standards to allow for the\ndirect debiting of every EUR-denominated bank account within the SEPA region.\n\nIn order to debit an account, businesses must collect their customer’s name and\nbank account number in IBAN format. During the payment flow, customers must\naccept a mandate that gives the business an authorization to debit the account.\nStripe is able to generate this mandate for businesses to present to their\ncustomers. Locate the ID of the mandate used for this payment on the Charge\nunder the\n[payment_method_details.sepa_debit.mandate](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-payment_method_details-sepa_debit-mandate)\nproperty. Then, use the mandate ID to [retrieve the\nMandate](https://docs.stripe.com/api/mandates/retrieve).\n\nSEPA Direct Debit is a\n[reusable](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#usage), [delayed\nnotification](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#payment-notification)\npayment method.\n\nSEPA Direct Debit transactions have a limit of 10,000 EUR each. For new users,\nthere’s an additional weekly limit of 10,000 EUR, which quickly increases as you\nprocess more SEPA direct debit payments. If you need higher limits, [contact\nsupport.](https://support.stripe.com/contact)\n\nPayment method propertiesBusiness locationsProduct support- **Customer\nlocations**\n\nEU\n- **Payment method family**\n\nBank debit\n- **Connect support**\n\n[Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sepa-debit#connect)\n- **Presentment currency**\n\nEUR\n- **Recurring Payments**\n\nYes\n- **Payout timing**\n\nSee [Payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sepa-debit#payouts)\n- **Dispute support**\n\n[Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sepa-debit#disputed-payments)\n- **Manual capture support**\n\nNo\n- **Payment confirmation**\n\nBusiness-initiated\n- **Refunds / Partial refunds**\n\n[Yes / Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sepa-debit#refunds)\n\n## Verification Requirements\n\nUsing SEPA Direct Debit requires you to complete additional [identity\nverification](https://support.stripe.com/questions/common-questions-about-stripe-identity#how-verification-works)\nsteps. We prompt you to complete these steps after you request access from the\n[Payment methods\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods). If you require\nfurther assistance, please [contact\nsupport](https://support.stripe.com/contact).\n\n## Payment flow\n\n!\n\n[Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers) selects SEPA Direct Debit at\ncheckout\n\n!\n\nCustomer provides full name, IBAN, and authorizes mandate\n\n!\n\nCustomer gets notification that the payment is complete\n\n## Get started\n\nYou don’t have to integrate SEPA Direct Debit and other payment methods\nindividually. If you use our front-end products, Stripe automatically determines\nthe most relevant payment methods to display. Go to the [Stripe\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and enable\nSEPA Direct Debit. To get started with one of our hosted UIs, follow a\nquickstart:\n\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart): Our prebuilt, hosted\ncheckout page.\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart): Our drop-in UI\ncomponents.\n\n### Other payment products\n\nThe following Stripe products also let you add SEPA Direct Debit from the\nDashboard:\n\n- [Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/no-code-guide)\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n- [Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview)\n\nIf you prefer to manually list payment methods or want to save SEPA Direct Debit\ndetails for future payments, see the following guides:\n\n- [Manually configure SEPA Direct Debit as a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sepa-debit/accept-a-payment)\n- [Save SEPA Direct Debit details for future\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sepa-debit/set-up-payment)\n\n## Debit notification emails\n\nThe [SEPA Direct Debit\nrulebook](http://www.europeanpaymentscouncil.eu/index.cfm/sepa-direct-debit/sepa-direct-debit-core-scheme-sdd-core)\nrequires that you notify your customer each time you debit their account. For\nthis case, by default, Stripe automatically sends the customer an email.\n\n#### Note\n\nWhen processing SEPA Direct Debit payments using the Stripe [Creditor\nID](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sepa-debit#creditor-identifiers-(creditor-id)),\ndebit notification emails are always sent automatically by Stripe.\n\nIf you decide to send your customer a custom notification:\n\n- Turn off Stripe emails in the [Stripe Dashboard email\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/emails). However, if you use the\nSources API, you can only control emails using\n[mandate.notification_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sources/update#update_source-mandate-notification_method)\n(for more information, see [notifying customers of recurring\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/sources/sepa-debit#notifying-customers-of-recurring-payments)).\n- Use the\n[payment_intent.processing](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-payment_intent.processing)\nevent to trigger debit initiation emails.\n- The email must include:- The last 4 digits of the debtor’s bank account\n- The mandate reference (`sepa_debit[reference]` on the Mandate)\n- The amount to be debited\n- Your SEPA creditor identifier\n- Your contact information\n- It’s standard to send notifications at least 14 calendar days before you\ncreate a payment. However, SEPA rules let you send notifications closer to the\npayment date—just make sure your mandate clearly states when customers can\nexpect to receive a notification. The mandate provided by Stripe specifies this\ncan happen up to two calendar days in advance of future payments, allowing you\nto send notifications at payment creation. For recurring payments of the same\namount (for example, a\n[subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating) of a\nfixed amount), you may indicate multiple upcoming debits with corresponding\ndates in a single notice.\n\n## Connect\n\nTo use SEPA Direct Debits in a [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)\nintegration, you must enable SEPA Direct Debit on your platform and request the\n`sepa_debit_payments` capability for your connected accounts.\n\n## Creditor Identifiers (Creditor ID)\n\nA SEPA Creditor Identifier (Creditor ID) is an ID associated with each SEPA\nDirect Debit payment that identifies the company requesting the payment. While\ncompanies may have multiple creditor identifiers, each creditor identifier is\nunique and allows your customers to easily identify the debits on their account.\n\nBy default, your Stripe account is configured to use a Stripe Creditor ID when\ncollecting SEPA Direct Debit Payments. The Creditor Name that appears on bank\nstatements is determined by the following order of priority:\n\n- Your business name or legal entity name. For Connect, Stripe defaults to using\nthe connected account’s business name if available. If not, Stripe uses the\nplatform account’s business name.\n- Your Stripe account’s custom [statement\ndescriptor](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/statement-descriptors).\nFor Connect accounts, Stripe defaults to the connected account’s statement\ndescriptor if available. If not, Stripe uses the platform account’s descriptor.\n- A default Stripe name (e.g., “Stripe Technologies Europe Ltd”)\n\nWe recommend:\n\n- Configuring a recognizable statement descriptor to help customers identify\npayments and reduce the risk of disputes.\n- If you’re based in the EU, use your own Creditor ID to both reduce dispute\nrates and improve your customer experience. You can configure your own Creditor\nID on the [Payment Method\nSettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) page in the\nDashboard.\n- If you’re using the Stripe Creditor ID, use [Stripe\nCheckout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout) to collect mandates from\nyour customers for SEPA Direct Debits.\n\n#### Note\n\nAfter you’ve collected live SEPA Direct Debit payments on your account, you\ncan’t change your Creditor ID in the Dashboard. If you need help with this\nissue, contact [Stripe support](https://support.stripe.com/contact) for\ninformation about migrating to a new Creditor ID.\n\n### Creditor identifiers and Connect\n\nThe charge type of Connect payments changes the creditor identifier and name\nwhich appear on the customer’s bank statement.\n\nCharge typeCreditor ID taken\nfrom[Direct](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges)Connected\nAccount[Destination](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges)Platform[Separate\ncharges and\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)Platform[Destination\n(on_behalf_of)](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges#settlement-merchant)Connected\nAccount[Separate charge and transfer\n(on_behalf_of)](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers#settlement-merchant)Connected\nAccount\n## Failed payments\n\nSEPA Debit payment failures can occur for a number of reasons, such as a\ncustomer’s account being frozen or having insufficient funds.\n\nWhen a payment fails, Stripe provides a failure reason in the `failure_code`\nfield on the `Charge`. Stripe also provides an extended description in the\n`failure_message` field on the `Charge`. Stripe immediately removes funds from\nyour Stripe balance after failures.\n\nThe following table lists the possible SEPA Debit payment failure codes with\nrecommended next steps.\n\nFailure codeExplanationNext stepsrefer_to_customerWe don’t have detailed\ninformation about the payment failure because your customer’s bank didn’t\nprovide a reason code.Reach out to your customer for additional\ninformation.insufficient_fundsThe payment process can’t be completed because\nyour customer’s bank account lacks the necessary funds.Reach out to your\ncustomer to verify that they have the required funds, then retry the\ntransaction.debit_disputedYour customer requested that their bank refund this\npayment.Reach out to your customer to resolve any dispute, then retry the\ntransaction.authorization_revokedYour customer revoked their authorization and\nrefused this payment.Reach out to your customer to understand the reasons for\nthis revocation, then collect a new mandate and retry the\ntransaction.debit_not_authorizedThe payment lacks an authorized mandate.Collect\na new mandate and retry the transaction.account_closedThe payment can’t be\nprocessed because your customer’s bank account is closed.Reach out to your\ncustomer for new account details, then try the transaction\nagain.bank_account_restrictedThe payment can’t be processed because your\ncustomer’s bank has blocked Direct Debits, due to either the bank’s actions or\nyour customer’s.Reach out to your customer to understand the reason for the\nblock.

Any disputes within this\nperiod are automatically honored.\n\nAfter eight weeks and up to 13 months, a customer can only dispute a payment\nwith their bank if the debit is considered unauthorized. If this occurs, we\nautomatically provide the bank with the mandate that the customer approved. This\ndoes not guarantee cancellation of the dispute; the bank can still decide that\nthe debit was unauthorized and the customer is entitled to a refund.\n\nA dispute can also occur if the bank is unable to debit the customer’s account\nbecause of an issue (for example, the account is frozen or has insufficient\nfunds), but has already provided the funds to make the charge successful. If\nthis occurs, the bank reclaims the funds in the form of a dispute.\n\nWhen a dispute is created, a `charge.dispute.created`\n[webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) event is sent and Stripe deducts the\ndispute amount and dispute fee from your Stripe balance. The dispute fee varies\nbased on your account’s default settlement currency:\n\nSettlement currencyFailure feeDispute feeAUD5 AUD25 AUDBGN7 BGN30 BGNCAD5 CAD20\nCADCHF3 CHF15 CHFCZK85 CZK360 CZKDKK25 DKK115 DKKEUR3.50 EUR15 EURGBP3 GBP13\nGBPHKD30 HKD130 HKDHUF1350 HUF5750 HUFJPY550 JPY2375 JPYMXN65 MXN280 MXNNOK40\nNOK175 NOKNZD5 NZD30 NZDPLN15 PLN65 PLNRON15 RON75 RONSEK40 SEK175 SEKSGD5 SGD20\nSGDUSD5 USD15 USDZAR70 ZAR300 ZAR\nUnlike [credit card disputes](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes), SEPA Direct\nDebit disputes are final and there is no process for appeal. If a customer\nsuccessfully disputes a payment, you must contact them if you want to resolve\nthe situation. If you come to an arrangement and your customer is willing to\nreturn the funds to you, they must make a new payment.\n\nIn general, each dispute includes the reason for its creation, but this varies\nfrom country to country. For example, disputed payments in Germany don’t provide\nadditional information for privacy reasons.\n\nIf a payment is disputed, and that payment is associated with a multi-use\nmandate, that mandate could be deactivated. Make sure to check the status of\nsuch mandates after a dispute. You have to re-collect mandate acceptance from\nyour customers if their previous mandate is deactivated.\n\n## Payouts\n\nSEPA Direct Debit payments are subject to a 5 business day [payout\ntiming](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts#standard-payout-timing) if your current\npayout timing is less than 5 business days or 7 calendar days. When you reach\n35,000 USD of SEPA Direct Debit processing volume, payout timing for SEPA Direct\nDebit payments returns to normal.\n\n## Refunds\n\nCustomers can dispute a payment with their bank even after it has been refunded,\nresulting in two credits for the same payment. To prevent fraud, refunds may be\ndisabled upon first refund attempt until your account has been reviewed. The\nreview can take up to 2 business days. If you need assistance processing a\nrefund, contact [Support](https://support.stripe.com/contact/) for further\ninformation.\n\nFor accounts with refunds enabled, Stripe recommends issuing refunds on SEPA\nDirect Debit payments only when:\n\n- It is a trusted and verified customer\n- You have confirmed with the customer that you’re refunding the payment\n- 7 business days have passed since you initiated the payment\n\nRefunds for payments made with SEPA Direct Debit must be submitted within 180\ndays from the date of the original payment. Refunds require additional time to\nprocess (typically three to four business days). If you accidentally debit your\ncustomer, contact them immediately to avoid a payment dispute.\n\nSEPA doesn’t explicitly label refunds when the funds are deposited back to a\ncustomer’s bank account. Instead, refunds are processed as a credit and include\na visible reference to the original payment’s statement descriptor.\n\nWhen issuing a refund, you should inform your customer immediately that the\nrefund can take up to 5 business days to arrive in their bank account.\n\n## Smart retries Private preview\n\n## Request early access to SEPA Debit smart retries\n\nJoin our private preview.\n\nCollect EmailSign upRead our [privacy policy](https://stripe.com/privacy).\n\n## Links\n\n- [Single Euro Payments Area\n(SEPA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Euro_Payments_Area)\n-\n[payment_method_details.sepa_debit.mandate](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-payment_method_details-sepa_debit-mandate)\n- [retrieve the Mandate](https://docs.stripe.com/api/mandates/retrieve)\n- [pricing details](https://stripe.com/pricing/local-payment-methods)\n- [reusable](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#usage)\n- [delayed\nnotification](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#payment-notification)\n- [contact support.](https://support.stripe.com/contact)\n- [Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sepa-debit#connect)\n- [Payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sepa-debit#payouts)\n- [Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sepa-debit#disputed-payments)\n- [Yes / Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sepa-debit#refunds)\n- [identity\nverification](https://support.stripe.com/questions/common-questions-about-stripe-identity#how-verification-works)\n- [Payment methods\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods)\n- [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers)\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart)\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart)\n- [Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/no-code-guide)\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n- [Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview)\n- [Manually configure SEPA Direct Debit as a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sepa-debit/accept-a-payment)\n- [Save SEPA Direct Debit details for future\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sepa-debit/set-up-payment)\n- [SEPA Direct Debit\nrulebook](http://www.europeanpaymentscouncil.eu/index.cfm/sepa-direct-debit/sepa-direct-debit-core-scheme-sdd-core)\n- [Creditor\nID](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sepa-debit#creditor-identifiers-(creditor-id))\n- [Stripe Dashboard email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/emails)\n-\n[mandate.notification_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sources/update#update_source-mandate-notification_method)\n- [notifying customers of recurring\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/sources/sepa-debit#notifying-customers-of-recurring-payments)\n-\n[payment_intent.processing](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-payment_intent.processing)\n- [subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating)\n- [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)\n- [statement\ndescriptor](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/statement-descriptors)\n- [Stripe Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout)\n- [Direct](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges)\n- [Destination](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges)\n- [Separate charges and\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n- [Destination\n(on_behalf_of)](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges#settlement-merchant)\n- [Separate charge and transfer\n(on_behalf_of)](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers#settlement-merchant)\n- [Support](https://stripe.com/support)\n- [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks)\n- [credit card disputes](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes)\n- [payout timing](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts#standard-payout-timing)\n- [Support](https://support.stripe.com/contact/)\n- [privacy policy](https://stripe.com/privacy)",
