Within this view, you can see the eligibility of each of\nyour connected accounts to use the payment method.\n\n#### Note\n\nThis view includes connected accounts that:\n\n- Have processed a payment in the last 90 days and are older than 30 days.\n- Are less than 30 days old, regardless of their payment activity.\n\nEach connected account appears in one of four different categories:\n\nCategoryDescriptionEnabledThese businesses already have the capability for this\npayment method set to `active`.EligibleThese businesses have met all compliance\nrequirements and passed any relevant MCC checks to have the payment method\ncapability set to `active` when requested.Missing InfoThese businesses are\nmissing some compliance plan information needed to add the payment\nmethod.IneligibleThese businesses aren’t eligible for the payment method, either\ndue to country location or MCC.\nCountries you have connected accounts in that aren’t supported by the payment\nmethod appear grayed out.\n\n[Enable payment\nmethod](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/payment-methods#enable-payment-method)\nTo enable the payment method for your connected accounts:\n\n- Apply the [capability](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities)\nto your connected accounts by selecting **On by default** from the top-level\ndropdown located to the right of the payment method.\n- *(Optional)* Edit the setting to `Off` for any countries where you want to\ndisable the payment method.\n- Select **Review Changes** to confirm your selections.\n\nAfter you review and confirm your update, Stripe converts all `Eligible`\nconnected accounts to `Enabled`, with a capability status of `active`. Stripe\nalso automatically applies the capability to new accounts as they become\neligible. This could happen because a new account signs up for your platform and\nfinishes inputting their information or because an account updates their\ninformation to become eligible for the payment method, such as updating their\nMCC from one that’s ineligible to one that’s eligible.\n\n![The button to review\nchanges](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/review-changes.d8ab55ad8f1d32cf8502520366aa6de8.png)\n\nReview changes\n\n#### Private preview\n\nThe **embedded payment method settings component** allows connected accounts to\nconfigure the payment methods they offer at checkout without the need to access\nthe Stripe Dashboard.
