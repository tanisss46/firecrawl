# Regulatory receipts

## Learn about hosted transaction receipts.

All changes to a balance have a corresponding [Transaction
object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transactions/object) that provides
a summary of money movements. Some transaction types are considered *regulated*
under Stripe’s money transmission licenses and require special treatment. You,
the platform, must offer a transaction receipt and present disclosures to the
customers of the sellers and service providers (connected accounts) on the
platform taking part in regulated transactions.

## Providing access to receipts

Stripe provides hosted regulatory transaction receipts on all of our money
movement resources, recording the URL as the value for the
`hosted_regulatory_receipt_url` attribute. This hosted receipt includes a
description of the transaction, amount, timing information, and relevant
disclosures. Because the sellers and service providers (connected accounts) on
your platform don’t have Stripe Dashboard access, you must provide them with the
ability to retrieve receipts from within the product.
