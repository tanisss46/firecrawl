# Collect tax in Cambodia

## Learn how to use Stripe Tax to calculate, collect, and report tax in Cambodia.

In Cambodia, Stripe only supports collecting
[VAT](https://www.tax.gov.kh/en/faq#) for digital goods and services. In Stripe,
these are referred to as “digital products.” To collect this tax on Stripe, you
must be a remote seller without a physical presence in the country.

## When to register for tax collection

See [Thresholds](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/thresholds) to get insights
about your potential tax registration obligations in Cambodia. Stripe also
notifies you with email and Dashboard alerts when you need to register to
collect tax. Learn more about how the [monitoring tool
works](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/monitoring).

Remote sellers supplying digital goods and services to consumers in Cambodia are
required to register for VAT within 30 days when their taxable sales of digital
goods and services exceeds KHR 250,000,000. Businesses also have to register if
they expect to exceed KHR 60 million (approximately USD 15,000) in any
3-month-consecutive period.

- **Threshold**: KHR 250 million
- **Time frame**: Current year
- **Included transactions**: Business-to-consumer (B2C) and Business-to-business
(B2B) sales of digital goods and services

## How we calculate taxes

We only support calculations for [digital
products](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes?type=digital) (non-physical
items or services that are delivered, given, or rendered electronically) in
Cambodia. Stripe doesn’t calculate tax for products that don’t use a digital
product tax code.

View the list of supported [digital product tax
codes](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes?type=digital). To calculate taxes
in Cambodia, make sure that you [assign a tax
code](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/products-prices-tax-codes-tax-behavior#tax-code-on-product)
to each of your products.

## Report and file your taxes

Stripe provides reports of your completed tax transactions. Go to
[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations) to access these
reports. Learn more about [the different types of
reports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports).

You’re responsible for filing and remitting your taxes to Cambodia. Stripe
doesn’t file taxes on your behalf.
