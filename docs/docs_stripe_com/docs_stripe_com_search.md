# Search

## Look up objects in your Stripe data.

Some top level API resources support retrieval with search API methods. You can
use the search APIs to retrieve your Stripe objects in a flexible manner. Using
search is a faster alternative to
[paginating](https://docs.stripe.com/api/pagination) through all resources. To
create a search query, review the [Search query
language](https://docs.stripe.com/search#search-query-language) and reference
the query fields of the resource:

- [Query fields for
Charges](https://docs.stripe.com/search#query-fields-for-charges)
- [Query fields for
Customers](https://docs.stripe.com/search#query-fields-for-customers)
- [Query fields for
Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/search#query-fields-for-invoices)
- [Query fields for
PaymentIntents](https://docs.stripe.com/search#query-fields-for-paymentintents)
- [Query fields for
Prices](https://docs.stripe.com/search#query-fields-for-prices)
- [Query fields for
Products](https://docs.stripe.com/search#query-fields-for-products)
- [Query fields for
Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/search#query-fields-for-subscriptions)

## Limitations

### Minimum API version

The minimum supported API Version to use search is `2020-08-27`. Read our [API
upgrades guide](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades) to learn more about upgrades.
To use search without upgrading your account API version, you can override the
API version on a single request by setting the `Stripe-Version` request header:

```
-H "Stripe-Version: 2025-02-24.acacia"
```

Read our [SDKs](https://docs.stripe.com/sdks#versioning) guide on how to
override an API version when using a library.

### Data freshness

Don’t use search for read-after-write flows (for example, searching immediately
after a charge is made) because the data won’t be immediately available to
search. Under normal operating conditions, data is searchable in under 1 minute.
Propagation of new or updated data could be delayed during an outage.

For read-after-write flows that require immediate data availability, use the
various list APIs, such as [List
invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/list)). These APIs aren’t subject
to the availability delays mentioned above.

### Data mismatches

In some cases, the data you use to find search results might not match the
results that you receive. This can happen because the Search API filters using a
cached version of the PaymentIntent `status`, but returns data based on the
latest version of the PaymentIntent.

For example, if you query the [Search Payment Intents
API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/search) for PaymentIntents with
the status `requires_capture`, it might return some PaymentIntents with the
status `succeeded`. This happens because the Search API finds cached
PaymentIntents that have the older `requires_capture` status, but returns the
current `succeeded` status in the results.

### Rate limits

We apply a [rate limit](https://docs.stripe.com/rate-limits) of up to 20 read
operations per second which applies for all search endpoints in live mode and
test environments. Live mode and test environment limits are separate. Keeping
the rate limit in mind, for workloads where you need to run analytics on one or
more API resources,
[Sigma](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data/access-data-in-dashboard) is much
more efficient. For workloads where you need to export a large portion of your
API resource, our [Data
Pipeline](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data/access-data-in-warehouse) product
is more efficient.

### Regional availability

Search isn’t available to merchants in India.

### Test clock objects omitted in list all results

Stripe list APIs (such as [List
invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/list)) omit results generated by
test clocks for list all requests. To see results generated by test clocks in
these cases, you must request results within a specific parent, such as
`test_clock`, `customer`, or `subscription`.

For example, `GET /v1/invoices` won’t return test clock generated invoices, but
`GET /v1/invoices/{customer_id}` returns all invoices for that customer,
including those that are test clock generated.

Similarly, you can specify a test clock ID in this example to get all invoices
related to that test clock, or you can specify a subscription ID to return all
invoices billed for that subscription, including test clock generated invoices.

## Examples

Here are some examples of what you can do with the [Search charges
API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/search) and [Search PaymentIntents
API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/search):

### Charges metadata search

Look up charges matching a custom metadata value.

```
curl -G https://api.stripe.com/v1/charges/search \
 -u "sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:" \
 --data-urlencode query="metadata['key']:'value'"
```

### Charges last4 search

Look up charges matching the last 4 digits of the card used for the payment.

```
curl -G https://api.stripe.com/v1/charges/search \
 -u "sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:" \
 --data-urlencode query="payment_method_details.card.last4:4242"
```

### Customers email search

Look up customers matching an email.

```
curl -G https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers/search \
 -u "sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:" \
 --data-urlencode query="email:'sally@rocketrides.io'"
```

### Negation filter

Look up PaymentIntents not in the USD currency.

```
curl -G https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents/search \
 -u "sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:" \
 --data-urlencode query="-currency:'usd'"
```

### Numeric filter

Filter invoice objects with a `total` greater than 1000.

```
curl -G https://api.stripe.com/v1/invoices/search \
 -u "sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:" \
 -d query="total>1000"
```

### Combining multiple filters

Look up charges matching a combination of metadata and currency.

```
curl -G https://api.stripe.com/v1/charges/search \
 -u "sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:" \
 --data-urlencode query="metadata['key']:'value' AND currency:'usd'"
```

## Search query language

### Query structure and terminology

A query `clause` consists of a `field` followed by an `operator` followed by a
`value`:

clause`email:"amy@rocketrides.io"`field`email`operator`:`value`amy@rocketrides.io`
You can combine up to 10 query clauses in a search by either separating them
with a space, or using the `AND` or `OR` keywords (case insensitive). You can’t
combine `AND` and `OR` in the same query. Furthermore, there’s no option to use
parentheses to give priority to certain logic operators. By default, the API
combines clauses with `AND` logic.

The example query `email:"amy@rocketrides.io" metadata["key"]:"value"` matches
records where both the email address is amy@rocketrides.io, and the metadata in
the record includes `key` with a value of `value`.

### Creating a query which does not match a clause

You can negate query clauses using a `-` character. For example, the following
search returns records that don’t match the email `amy@rocketrides.io`.

`-email:"amy@rocketrides.io"`

### Field types, substring matching, and numeric comparators

Every search field supports exact matching with a `:`. Certain fields such as
`email` and `name` support substring matching. Certain other fields such as
`amount` support numeric comparators like `>` and `<`.

Each field includes a type that defines the operations you can use in the field.
For a full list of available fields, see [supported query fields for each
resource](https://docs.stripe.com/search#supported-query-fields-for-each-resource).

Using an unsupported operator, such as specifying greater than (`>`) on a
string, returns an error.

typeoperatorstokenexact match (case insensitive)
string

exact match, substring (case insensitive)

An exact match on a string type returns any record where that record contains
all of the words from the query in the same order. For example the query
`name:"one two three"` would match both a result with the name “one two three”
and a result with the name “one two three four”.

numericexact match, greater than and less than
### Quotes

You must use quotation marks around string values. Quotation marks are optional
for numeric values. For example:

- `currency:"usd"` means quotes are required.
- `payment_method_details.card.last4:1234` means quotes are optional.

You can escape quotes inside of quotes with a backslash (`\`).

`description:"the story called \"The Sky and the Sea.\""`

### Metadata

You can perform searches on [metadata](https://docs.stripe.com/api/metadata)
that you’ve added to objects that support it.

Use the following format to construct a clause for a metadata search:
`metadata["<field>"]:"<value>"`.

The following clause demonstrates how to create a clause that queries for
records with a donation ID of “asdf-jkl”: `metadata["donation-id"]:"asdf-jkl"`.

You can query for the presence of a metadata key on an object. The following
clause would match all records where `donation-id` is a metadata key.
`-metadata["donation-id"]:null`

### Search Syntax

The following table lists the syntax that you can use to construct a query.

SyntaxUsageDescriptionExamples`:``field:value`Exact match operator (case
insensitive)`currency:"eur"` returns records where the currency is exactly “EUR”

online charges, `interac_present` for Terminal card present charges for the
Interac network, and `card_present` for other Terminal card present charges.

The `disputed` field accepts only the tokens “true” and “false”, indicating the
presence of disputes.

`refunded:"true"` filters for fully-refunded charges, `refunded:"false"` filters
