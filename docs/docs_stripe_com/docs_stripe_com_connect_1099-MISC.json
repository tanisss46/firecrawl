Filing requirements for some states might differ from\nfederal requirements.\n\nWe outline state filing requirements for 1099-MISC forms to help you identify\nwhich [states you can file\ndirectly](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/tax-forms-state-requirements) in your\nDashboard, which states require a state tax registration or withholding ID when\nfiling, and which states you’re responsible for filing directly with.\n\n#### Note\n\nIn the case of some box types, we always supply the federal threshold:\n\n- Royalties - $10\n- Payments in lieu of dividends or interest - $10\n- Fishing boat proceeds - $0.01\n- Excess golden parachute payments - $0.01\n\n#### Warning\n\nIf you have done backup withholding or state withholding, you might have\nadditional reporting requirements with states. We recommend that you consult a\ntax advisor.\n\nSTATE 1099-MISC FILING REQUIRED DOES STRIPE FILE FILING DUE DATE* FILING\nTHRESHOLD IF ISSUED, PROVIDE STATE NUMBER AlabamaIf State WitholdingSame as\nIRS$0–AlaskaNo\n–\n\n–-–ArizonaIf State WitholdingSame as IRS$0–ArkansasCFSFSame as\nIRS$2,500–CaliforniaCFSFSame as IRSSame as IRS–ColoradoIf State WitholdingSame\nas IRS$0–ConnecticutIf State WitholdingSame as IRS$0Connecticut Tax Registration\nNumberDelawareState PortalSame as IRSSame as IRSMust use EINDistrict of\nColumbiaState PortalSame as IRSSame as IRS–FloridaNo\n–\n\n–-–GeorgiaIf State WitholdingSame as IRSSame as IRS–HawaiiCFSFSame as IRSSame as\nIRS–IdahoCFSFFebruary 28Same as IRSIdaho Withholding Account NumberIllinoisNo\n–\n\n–-–IndianaIf State WitholdingSame as IRS$0–IowaIf State WitholdingFebruary\n15$0–KansasIf State WitholdingSame as IRS$0Kansas Withholding Tax Account\nNumberKentuckyIf State WitholdingSame as IRS$0–LouisianaIf State WitholdingSame\nas IRS$0–MaineState PortalSame as IRSSame as IRS–MarylandIf State WitholdingSame\nas IRS$0Maryland Central Registration NumberMassachusettsState PortalSame as\nIRSSame as IRS–MichiganCFSFSame as IRSSame as IRS–MinnesotaIf State\nWitholdingSame as IRS$0–MississippiIf State WitholdingFebruary\n28$0–MissouriCFSFSame as IRSSame as IRS–MontanaState PortalFebruary 28Same as\nIRS–NebraskaIf State WitholdingSame as IRS$0Nebraska NumberNevadaNo\n–\n\n–-–New HampshireNo\n–\n\n–-–New JerseyCFSFSame as IRSSame as IRS–New MexicoCFSFSame as IRSSame as IRS–New\nYorkNo\n–\n\n–-–North CarolinaIf State WitholdingSame as IRS$0NC Withholding ID Number or\nEINNorth DakotaIf State WitholdingSame as IRS$0–OhioIf State WitholdingSame as\nIRS$0–OklahomaCFSFSame as IRSSame as IRSOklahoma Withholding Account\nIDOregonState PortalSame as IRSSame as IRS–PennsylvaniaState PortalSame as\nIRSSame as IRSPA Employer Account IDRhode IslandIf State WitholdingSame as\nIRS$100–South CarolinaIf State WitholdingSame as IRS$0SC Withholding File Number\nor EINSouth DakotaNo\n–\n\n–-–TennesseeNo\n–\n\n–-–TexasNo\n–\n\n–-–UtahIf State WitholdingSame as IRS$0–VermontIf State WitholdingSame as\nIRS$0Vermont Withholding Account NumberVirginiaIf State WitholdingSame as\nIRS$0–WashingtonNo\n–\n\n–-–West VirginiaIf State WitholdingSame as IRS$0–WisconsinIf State\nWitholdingSame as IRS$0Wisconsin Withholding Tax Number**WyomingNo\n–\n\n–-–\n*January 22, 2025 is the latest recommended date to file forms with the IRS and\nstates in your Stripe Dashboard\n\n**If a Wisconsin withholding tax number isn’t provided, Stripe uses the default\nvalue of `036888888888801` instead.\n\n## How to interpret form state requirements\n\nStripe supports filing in all states that require 1099-MISC filing and don’t\nhave withholding-based filing requirements. When you file your 1099-MISC forms\nfrom the [Tax forms view](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/taxes/forms) in\nthe Dashboard, Stripe submits your forms to the IRS and all qualifying states.\n\n### 1099-MISC FILING REQUIRED\n\nState PortalStripe submits the forms directly to these states. An additional\nstate filing fee of 1.49 USD applies per 1099-MISC form filed directly with\nstate revenue authorities.\nCFSF\n\nStates listed as CFSF are part of the Combined Federal / State Filing (CFSF)\nprogram. Forms filed to the IRS are automatically forwarded to the state,\neliminating separate reporting to the participating states. If forms have\nalready been filed with the IRS, you won’t be charged an additional state filing\nfee for filing in these states.\n\nSome states still require direct filing with the state, even though they\nparticipate in the CFSF program. Stripe submits the forms directly to these\nstates.\n\nIf State WithholdingYou’re required to file a 1099-MISC form with that state\nonly if you withheld state taxes. In your Dashboard, you can specify the amount\nwithheld by updating the form and updating the `state_tax_withheld` column. When\nyou file your 1099-MISC forms in the Dashboard, we automatically export forms\neligible for state filing and with `state_tax_withheld` so you can file directly\nwith applicable states.\n#### Note\n\nSome forms that appear to be below the federal filing threshold can also appear\nas `Ready` or `Needs attention` due to Grouped TINs or state filing thresholds.\n[Learn\nmore](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/file-tax-forms#below-threshold-forms)\n\n### FILING DUE DATE\n\nWhile the IRS filing deadline for 1099-MISC forms is March 31 and the IRS\ndeadline to deliver 1099 forms to your payees is January 31, we coupled filing\nand delivery together to streamline the tax reporting process. **January 22,\n2025** is the latest recommended date to file forms with the IRS and states in\nyour Stripe Dashboard. This guarantees forms are filed with the IRS and a copy\nis sent to the recipients before the IRS delivery deadline of January 31.\n\n### STATE NUMBERS\n\nSome states require State Tax Registration or Withholding IDs. Delaware and\nPennsylvania typically reject state filings for 1099-MISC, when state IDs are\nmissing and a state ID was issued. After you obtain the registration or\nwithholding ID, add the states in which you’ll file and the corresponding IDs on\nthe [Tax forms\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/tax_forms) page. In the\nDashboard, click **Settings**. On **Product settings**, under **Connect**, click\n**Tax form settings**. When filing forms in your Dashboard, you must provide an\nappropriate ID in states that require one.\n\n## See also\n\n- [File form with\nstates](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/tax-forms-state-requirements)\n- [Add the state tax Registration or withholding\nID](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/tax-forms-state-requirements#add-state-reg)\n\n## Links\n\n- [states you can file\ndirectly](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/tax-forms-state-requirements)\n- [Tax forms view](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/taxes/forms)\n- [Learn\nmore](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/file-tax-forms#below-threshold-forms)\n- [Tax forms settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/tax_forms)\n- [Add the state tax Registration or withholding\nID](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/tax-forms-state-requirements#add-state-reg)",
