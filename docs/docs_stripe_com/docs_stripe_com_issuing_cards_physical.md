## Launch your card

The following illustration captures the timeline for each type of card. If
you’re interested in custom cards, we recommend starting with standard cards for
a pilot launch while we work on the custom cards in parallel. Custom cards
typically take 8-10 weeks to produce, though this can vary depending on the
design complexity. We advise you on the timeline during your guided design
sessions.
