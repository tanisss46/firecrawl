The [Tax Registration\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax/registrations) lets you retrieve and\nconfigure tax registrations using an API instead of the Dashboard. Adding your\nregistrations in Stripe turns on tax calculation and collection for your\ntransactions made through Stripe.\n\nDifferent rules determine when and how a business needs to register to collect\ntax depending on the location. You can also use [Stripe to\nregister](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/use-stripe-to-register) on your behalf or\ndo it yourself. [Learn more about tax collection in different\nlocations](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries).\n\n- **Connect platform**: As a platform, you can use this API to manage the\nregistrations of your connected accounts or to check an account’s active\nregistrations.\n- **Direct usage**: You can use this API to manage and check your registrations.\nConnect platformDirect usage\n## List all tax registrations for your connected accounts\n\nTo get a list of your connected accounts’ tax registrations, make a [list\nregistrations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax/registrations/all) call. You can\nfilter the response by setting the `status` parameter to `active`, `expired`, or\n`scheduled`.\n\n```\ncurl -G https://api.stripe.com/v1/tax/registrations \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -H \"Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}\" \\\n -d status=active \\\n -d limit=3\n```\n\nIf your connected accounts don’t have access to the Stripe Dashboard, your\nplatform can provide a UI for them to manage their tax registrations. The\nregistrations endpoint helps you implement that functionality.\n\n## Add a tax registration for your connected account\n\nIf a tax obligation and registration of the connected account is known to the\nplatform, you can perform a [create\nregistration](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax/registrations/create) call using\nthe `Stripe-Account` header with a value of the connected account ID to add or\nschedule the registration for the connected account.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/tax/registrations \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -H \"Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}\" \\\n -d country=IE \\\n -d \"country_options[ie][type]\"=oss_union \\\n -d active_from=now\n```\n\nIn this case, a `tax.registration` object is created in the connected account.\n\n```\n{\n \"object\": \"tax.registration\",\n \"active_from\": 1669249440,\n \"country\": \"IE\",\n \"country_options\": {\n \"ie\": {\n \"type\": \"oss_union\"\n }\n },\n \"livemode\": false,\n \"status\": \"active\",\n ...\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively, for connected accounts with access to the Stripe Dashboard (for\nexample, Standard accounts), you can instruct them to [set up Stripe\nTax](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/set-up) using the Dashboard, which includes\nadding tax registrations.\n\n### Head office address requirement\n\nTo add a tax registration, the connected account must first set up a head office\naddress. Without a defined head office address, an `invalid_request_error` gets\ntriggered with a message about setting your head office address.\n\nUse the [tax settings API](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/settings-api) to add a\nhead office address as a platform:\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/tax/settings \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -H \"Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}\" \\\n -d \"head_office[address][country]\"=DE\n```\n\nLocation-specific validation and errors might occur, details of which are found\nin our [tax settings\nguide](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/settings-api?tax-integration=connect-platform#validations-and-errors).\n\n## Update and expire a tax registration for your connected account\n\nYou can’t delete a registration after it’s created, but you can end it by\nsetting `expires_at` to a time when the registration is no longer active. Update\nthe registrations with an [update\nregistration](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax/registrations/update) call using\nthe Stripe-Account header with a value of the connected account ID:\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/tax/registrations/taxreg_NkyGPRPytKq66j \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -H \"Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}\" \\\n -d expires_at=now\n```\n\nIn this case, the registration expires immediately. [Tax\ncalculations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax/calculations) performed for the\nconnected account after the `expires_at` won’t use this registration.\n\n```\n{\n \"object\": \"tax.registration\",\n \"active_from\": 1669248000,\n \"created\": 1669219200,\n \"expires_at\": 1669334400,\n \"livemode\": false,\n \"status\": \"active\",\n ...\n}\n```\n\n[OptionalAdd a tax registration for the retail delivery\nfeeServer-side](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/registrations-api#tax-registration-retail-delivery-fee)\n## See also\n\n- [Use the Settings API to configure Stripe\nTax](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/settings-api)\n- [Use Stripe Tax with Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/connect)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Tax Registration API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax/registrations)\n- [Stripe to register](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/use-stripe-to-register)\n- [Learn more about tax collection in different\nlocations](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries)\n- [list registrations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax/registrations/all)\n- [create registration](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax/registrations/create)\n- [set up Stripe Tax](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/set-up)\n- [tax settings API](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/settings-api)\n- [tax settings\nguide](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/settings-api?tax-integration=connect-platform#validations-and-errors)\n- [update registration](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax/registrations/update)\n- [Tax calculations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax/calculations)\n- [Use Stripe Tax with Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/connect)",
