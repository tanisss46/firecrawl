For example, you can\nconfigure a rule to:\n\n- **Categorize** an [invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices) line item as\na tax or fee\n- **Book** a transaction amount or invoice line item as a passthrough fee\n- **Exclude** transactions from specific customers or test invoices\n- **Amortize** revenue over a specified time period relative to payment or\ninvoice finalization date\n- **Recognize** revenue after a specific time period to model a future\nfulfillment schedule\n- **Allocate** multiple revenue treatments to a single transaction amount\n\nRules are typically applied to reports within 24 hours. Rules that have\nsuccessfully been applied in the latest report have an `active` status. Rules\nthat haven’t remain in a `processing` status.\n\n## Default rules\n\nStripe Revenue Recognition provides a set of default rules to model the\n[methodology](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/methodology) for\nhandling common Stripe resources.\n\n- For invoice line items with service periods, the line item amount amortizes\nevenly over its service period. If a period isn’t set on an invoice line item,\nthe amount is recognized entirely when the invoice finalizes.\n- Other payments not made through an invoice are recognized immediately upon\npayment if no service period or fulfillment information exists, or by the\n[imported](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/data-import) service\nperiod or fulfillment data.\n\n![Default\nrules](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/default-rules.1cdaa035a358fec4294971ba23bddaa1.png)\n\n## Custom rules\n\nCustom rules override Stripe’s default revenue treatment behaviors where\napplicable and you can add or modify them on the Stripe Dashboard.\n\nYou can apply rules to:\n\n- [Products](https://docs.stripe.com/api/products)\n- [Customers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers)\n- [Invoice line items](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/line_item)\n- [Other payments](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges) (that is, payments that\naren’t associated with invoices)\n\nSee how to [create a rule and define revenue\ntreatments](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/rules/create-a-rule).\nYou can also explore sample rules on tax treatment, pass-through fees,\nexclusion, and custom time periods.\n\n## Rule ordering and hierarchy\n\nEach transaction can only have one rule applied to it when processing revenue\nreports. In situations where a single transaction fits the “Apply-to” criteria\nfor multiple rules, rule hierarchy determines which rule to apply to the\ntransaction. The higher a rule is ranked on the list, the higher the priority\nit’s assigned.\n\nYou can rearrange the order of the rules by clicking **Change rule order** as\nshown below:\n\n![Rules](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/rules.076bd00821d7a78ec4d541afe8c9b669.png)\n\nAfter clicking **Change rule order**, you can reorder the rules to adjust their\npriorities.\n\n![Rule\norder](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/rule-order.6232b5130188f7e9b253d7f9d197e3f0.png)\n\n## Best practices for effectively maintaining your rules\n\nAs your business grows, it’s important to make sure you regularly maintain your\nrules to ensure the accuracy of your revenue reports. The following are some\nbest practices to keep rules correct for your Revenue Recognition reports.\n\n**Know when to create a rule**\n\nWhen applied correctly, Stripe’s default rules and revenue treatment methodology\nfor handling\n[subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating) events\naccurately recognize and defer revenue for businesses who require more control\nover their unique use.\n\n**Regularly monitor rules to ensure they’re up-to-date**\n\nBilling models, customer types and edge cases can regularly change, and you\nshould evolve your rules accordingly. To make sure that revenue treatments\nremain predictable, periodically check your rules so they’re up-to-date in terms\nof hierarchy and effective period.\n\n**Check if your accounting period is open or closed when new rules are applied**\n\nIf the effective period for a new rule overlaps with a closed accounting period,\nit generates corrections if the rules are retroactively applied to transactions\nfrom past (closed) accounting periods. If you want to avoid this, reopen your\nbooks by opening your accounting period prior to adding the rule.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Create a\nrule](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/rules/create-a-rule)\n- [Examples](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/rules/examples)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Revenue Recognition\nrules](https://dashboard.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/rules)\n- [invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n- [methodology](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/methodology)\n- [imported](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/data-import)\n- [Products](https://docs.stripe.com/api/products)\n- [Customers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers)\n- [Invoice line items](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/line_item)\n- [Other payments](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges)\n- [create a rule and define revenue\ntreatments](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/rules/create-a-rule)\n- [subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating)\n- [Examples](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/rules/examples)",
