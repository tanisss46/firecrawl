  "content": "# Collect tax in Tennessee\n\n## Learn how to use Stripe Tax to calculate, collect, and report tax in Tennessee.\n\n## When to register for tax collection\n\nSee [Thresholds](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/thresholds) to get insights\nabout your potential tax registration obligations in Tennessee. Stripe also\nnotifies you with email and Dashboard alerts when you need to register to\ncollect tax. Learn more about how the [monitoring tool\nworks](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/monitoring).\n\nRemote sellers must register to collect and remit tax in Tennessee when, in the\nprior twelve months, they exceed a sales threshold of 100,000 USD.\n\nThe threshold includes retail sales, whether taxable or nontaxable. The\nthreshold excludes wholesale sales (sales for resale) and marketplace sales.\n\n## Register to collect tax\n\nRegister for sales tax in Tennessee at the [tax\nauthority](https://www.tn.gov/revenue/taxes/sales-and-use-tax.html). Read more\nabout registering for [sales tax in the US in our\nguide](https://stripe.com/guides/sales-tax-registration-process-us).\n\nAfter you’ve registered to collect tax in Tennessee, go to\n[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations?location=us-tn)\nto add your registrations to Stripe in the Dashboard. This turns on tax\ncalculation and collection in Stripe for your transactions in Tennessee.\n\nLearn [how to add your\nregistration](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/registering#track-your-registrations-in-the-tax-dashboard)\nin the Dashboard.\n\n## How we calculate taxes\n\nIf your [origin address](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/set-up#origin-address) is\nin the US and differs from your customer’s state, Stripe always calculates tax\nbased on your customer’s location.\n\nIf your customer is in Tennessee and your origin address is also in Tennessee,\nStripe applies tax based on your origin address, depending on the type of\nproduct or service you sell.\n\n## Report and file your taxes\n\nStripe provides reports of your completed tax transactions. Go to\n[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations) to access these\nreports.\n\n### Exports\n\nThe tax transaction data export provides a comprehensive and aggregated view of\ntransactions by location, including a breakdown of individual tax amounts. Learn\nmore about [tax reporting exports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports#exports).\n\n### Location reports\n\n[Location reports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports#us-location-reports)\noffer a summary of transaction and refund data for specific US locations and\nalign with Tennessee filing requirements. You have the option to report on an\nannual, fiscal year, quarterly, or monthly basis.\n\nReporting-specific considerations:\n\n- In most areas of Tennessee, if the price of a single item exceeds the local\ntax limit for that specific area, the local tax doesn’t apply to that excess\namount. You won’t see a location report for Tennessee if you have these\ntransactions. Use the [exports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports#exports)\ninstead for a detailed tax breakdown of each transaction.\n\n### Filing\n\nStripe Tax has filing partners—Taxually, Marosa, and Hands-off Sales Tax\n(HOST)—to help automate your tax filing. These partners automatically sync your\ntax transaction data in real time, eliminating the need for manual data entry or\nfile transfers. Learn more about [tax\nfiling](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/filing).\n\n## Links\n\n- [Thresholds](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/thresholds)\n- [monitoring tool works](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/monitoring)\n- [tax authority](https://www.tn.gov/revenue/taxes/sales-and-use-tax.html)\n- [sales tax in the US in our\nguide](https://stripe.com/guides/sales-tax-registration-process-us)\n- [Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations?location=us-tn)\n- [how to add your\nregistration](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/registering#track-your-registrations-in-the-tax-dashboard)\n- [origin address](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/set-up#origin-address)\n- [Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations)\n- [tax reporting exports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports#exports)\n- [Location reports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports#us-location-reports)\n- [tax filing](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/filing)",
