  "content": "# NetSuite customer payment page\n\n## Allow customers to make payments toward their NetSuite balance using Stripe.\n\nUse the customer payment page to collect payments that you can then apply to\nmultiple invoices as partial payments, or to support other payment applications\nbeyond single invoices. The Stripe Connector for NetSuite automatically sets the\namount due on your NetSuite customer payment page to the NetSuite customer\nbalance total. But the connector allows customers to modify the amount they pay\nto any amount, up to the outstanding balance amount. Every accepted payment\nincludes automated payment processing, deposit automation, and fee calculation.\n\nYou can enable the [payment\nmethods](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/payment_methods) available\nto your customers in your Stripe account.\n\nA customer payment gets created and associated with the NetSuite customer. You\ncan also designate how you want to apply payments, based on your business needs.\nFor example, you can automate the payment application to specific invoices using\nnative NetSuite settings, a custom workflow, or a custom SuiteScript.\n\n## How it works\n\n- When you create a NetSuite customer, it creates the payment page link and adds\nit immediately. The payment page includes the following information:\n\n- NetSuite customer name\n- NetSuite total outstanding balance\n- Payment methods based on the customer region\n- Currency used in NetSuite (if [supported by\nStripe](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies))\n- Provide the customer payment page link to your customer in a NetSuite invoice\nemail, invoice PDF template, a portal on your website, or another communication\nmethod. The customer accesses the payment page and can pay any amount up to the\nfull customer balance.\n- The connector syncs the payment into NetSuite and creates an unapplied payment\nthat’s associated with the NetSuite customer.\n- In NetSuite, you can use the auto-apply feature to apply payments to the\noldest open invoices, until the total amount of the payment is used. The\nconnector can automatically enable NetSuite auto-apply to the payment from the\ncustomer payment page.\n- After the Stripe payout syncs as a bank deposit to NetSuite, the connector\nreconciles the payment against the corresponding bank deposit, and records\nprocessing fees and any currency conversion. This workflow is called [deposit\nautomation](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/netsuite/deposit-automation).\n[Disputes](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/netsuite/stripe-disputes-netsuite)\nand\n[refunds](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/netsuite/stripe-refunds-netsuite)\nsync to NetSuite automatically.\n\nNetSuite\n\nBusiness\n\nCustomer\n\nStripe\n\nNetSuite creates invoice and automatically generates payment page link\n\nYou send the payment link to your customer (automatically or manually)\n\nCustomer submits payment through Stripe Checkout\n\nStripe creates payment\n\nNetSuite syncs customer payment as an unapplied payment\n\nTwo business days later, Stripe sends payout to your bank account\n\nNetSuite creates deposit and moves payment from Undeposited Funds account to\ngeneral ledger account\n\nA diagram providing a high level overview of the customer payment page flow\noutlined in this doc\n## Customer payment page details\n\nCreating an invoice immediately creates a [Checkout payment\npage](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout) with a unique, secure URL. You\ncan access this URL in the customer payment page field\n(`custentity_customer_payment_page_link`).\n\nIf you implement the payment page for an existing NetSuite customer, the payment\npage uses the customer record creation date. If you implement the payment page\nfor a new NetSuite customer, the payment page uses a randomly-generated GUID\n(`custentity_customer_payment_page_guid`).\n\nIf there’s a remaining balance greater than 0.50 after the customer makes a\npayment, the payment page remains reusable for 24 hours.\n\nYou can configure the connector to use auto-apply by adding the following to the\n**Field mappings** in the app settings:\n\n```\n{\n \"customer_payment\":{\n \"metadata.netsuite_auto_apply\": \"auto-apply\"\n }\n}\n\n```\n\nThe customer’s payment method is only saved for future use if you select **Save\npayment method to Stripe customers** on the connector’s **Control** tab, under\n**NetSuite payment pages**. Saved payment methods are created under a new or\nexisting Stripe customer and linked to the NetSuite customer.\n\nYou can find the record sync and related record links in the Stripe Connector\nfor NetSuite app dashboard.\n\n## Automate bank reconciliation\n\nThe payment page includes [deposit\nautomation](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/netsuite/deposit-automation),\nwhich automates the bank reconciliation process for all payments, refunds, and\ndisputes from a Stripe payout to a NetSuite bank deposit.\n\n## Support multiple currencies and payment methods\n\nAccept payments in the [supported presentment\ncurrencies](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#presentment-currencies) in your\nregion. The payment page displays the currency that’s specified on the NetSuite\ninvoice. Stripe then creates a payment based on that currency.\n\nYou can enable the payment methods you want to accept on the [Payment\nmethods](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) page. Stripe\nsupports many categories of [payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/overview) based on\nyour region and business needs.\n\n## Save payment methods for future use\n\nYou can use the payment page to save a payment method for future use if needed.\nFor example, a connector add-on (such as Auto-Pay) might use the saved payment\nmethod to charge a customer for future invoices. Stripe saves the payment method\nto a new or existing [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers) object.\n\n#### Compliance\n\nYou’re responsible for your compliance with all applicable laws, regulations,\nand network rules when saving a customer’s payment details. For example, if you\nwant to save a payment method for future use, you need their agreement to be\nbilled outside of the connector’s payment flow. Getting that agreement up front\nallows you to save their payment details, and potentially charge them for future\ninvoices if needed.\n\nIf you plan to charge the customer while they’re offline, make sure that your\nterms also cover the following, at minimum:\n\n- The customer’s agreement to your initiating a payment or a series of payments\non their behalf for specified transactions.\n- The anticipated timing and frequency of payments (for example, whether charges\nare for scheduled installment or subscription payments, or for unscheduled\ntop-ups).\n- How the payment amount is determined.\n- Your cancellation policy, if you’re setting up the payment method for a\nsubscription service.\n\nMake sure you keep a record of your customer’s written agreement to these terms.\n\n## Customize the payment page\n\nYou can customize the look and feel of the payment page to match the design of\nyour site. Modify the payment page color and design on the [Branding\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding) page in the Stripe\nDashboard. Modify your name and statement descriptor on the [Public\ndetails](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public) page.\n\n## Add the payment page to your communications\n\nYou can integrate the payment page into your customer communications in\nNetSuite. For example, you might want to map the payment page’s unique link to a\n[Pay\nNow](https://support.stripe.com/questions/stripe-connector-for-netsuite-pay-now-button)\nbutton in your NetSuite email templates, invoice PDF templates, or manual\noutreach.\n\n## Send email receipts for payments\n\nYou have two options for sending email receipts to your customers:\n\n- Use Stripe to automatically send email receipts. The connector provides the\ninvoice ID and NetSuite customer email. To use this option, enable **Successful\npayments** on the [Customer emails\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/emails) page in the Stripe\nDashboard.\n- Use NetSuite to send email receipts for payments. You must disable email\nreceipts in the Stripe Dashboard and then set up a workflow to send customized\nemail receipts from NetSuite.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Invoice payment\npage](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/netsuite/invoice-payment-page)\n- [Deposit\nautomation](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/netsuite/deposit-automation)\n- [Refunds](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/netsuite/stripe-refunds-netsuite)\n-\n[Disputes](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/netsuite/stripe-disputes-netsuite)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Stripe App\nMarketplace](https://marketplace.stripe.com/apps/netsuite-connector)\n- [payment methods](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/payment_methods)\n- [supported by Stripe](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies)\n- [deposit\nautomation](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/netsuite/deposit-automation)\n-\n[Disputes](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/netsuite/stripe-disputes-netsuite)\n- [refunds](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/netsuite/stripe-refunds-netsuite)\n- [Checkout payment page](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout)\n- [supported presentment\ncurrencies](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#presentment-currencies)\n- [Payment methods](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods)\n- [payment methods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/overview)\n- [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers)\n- [Branding settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding)\n- [Public details](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public)\n- [Pay\nNow](https://support.stripe.com/questions/stripe-connector-for-netsuite-pay-now-button)\n- [Customer emails settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/emails)\n- [Invoice payment\npage](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/netsuite/invoice-payment-page)",
