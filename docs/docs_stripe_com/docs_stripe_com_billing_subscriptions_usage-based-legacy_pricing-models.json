See the [updated usage-based\nbilling docs](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based).\n\nLearn how to\n[migrate](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based-legacy/migration-guide).\n\nWith usage-based pricing models, you charge your customers based on how much of\nyour service they use during the billing cycle, instead of explicitly setting\nquantities, as in the\n[per-seat](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models#per-seat) and\n[flat rate](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models#flat-rate)\npricing models. (Another difference is that in the per-seat and flat-rate\nmodels, you could optionally collect payment for the billing cycle up front.\nWith metered billing, you have to collect payment in arrears.) You must also\n[record and report\nusage](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based-legacy/recording-usage).\n\nTogethere wants to charge on a per-minute basis for usage of their new\nconferencing service, where more usage drives the per-minute price lower for the\ncustomer.\n\nHere’s what that model looks like on Stripe:\n\n!\n\nUsage-based pricing model\n\n### Usage types\n\nFor recurring purchases, you define how much to charge customers through\n`usage_types`-either licensed or metered.\n\n### Licensed usage\n\n### Metered usage\n\n### Package and standard pricing\n\nIn the Dashboard, you can select **Standard pricing** or **Package pricing** as\npricing models. Both of these models map to the\n[licensed](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/create#create_price-recurring-usage_type)\n(`recurring[usage_type]='licensed'`) usage type. With both models, you specify\nthe number of units when you create or update a subscription. Here’s how they\ndiffer:\n\n- With **Standard pricing**, the quantity defaults to 1.\n- With **Package pricing**, you set the unit amount to values of 2 or more.\n\n### Model usage-based pricing on Stripe\n\nThe following example shows how to create a metered usage pricing model. In this\ncase, Togethere charges .07 USD per minute.\n\nDashboardAPI\nTo create a metered usage pricing model on Stripe through the Dashboard:\n\nFirst, create the `Per-minute pricing` product. To learn about all the options\nfor creating a product, see the [prices\nguide](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/manage-prices#create-product).\n\n- Go to the [Product catalog](https://dashboard.stripe.com/products).\n- Click **+ Add product**.\n- Enter the **Name** of the product: `Per-minute pricing`, in this case.\n- *(Optional)* Add a **Description**. The description appears at checkout, on\nthe [customer portal](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management), and in\n[quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/quotes).\n\nNext, create the monthly price for the `Per-minute pricing` product.\n\nClick **Advanced pricing options**. Select **Usage-based**, **Per tier**, and\n**Graduated** for the **Pricing model**.\n\nCreate three graduated pricing tiers:\n\nFirst unitLast unitPer unitFlat feeFor the first0600.25 USD0.00 USDFor the\nnext611200.20 USD0.00 USDFor the next121∞0.15 USD0.00 USD\nTo create a subscription using that price:\n\n- Go to the **Payments** > **Subscriptions**\n[page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/subscriptions).\n- Click **+ Create subscription**.\n- Find or add a customer.\n- Search for the `Per-minute pricing` product you created and select the price\nyou want to use.\n- *(Optional)* Select **Collect tax automatically** to use Stripe Tax.\n- Click **Start subscription** to start it immmediately or **Schedule\nsubscription** to choose when to start it.\n\nThe subscription integration guide explains how to fit pricing models into a\nfull integration.\n\n- If you’re using Stripe Checkout, the next step is to [create a Checkout\nsession](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/build-subscriptions?ui=stripe-hosted#create-session)\nfor your site. Make sure you set up Stripe.\n- If you’re using Stripe Elements, the next step is to [create a\nCustomer](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/build-subscriptions?ui=elements#create-customer).\nMake sure you set up Stripe and the sample application.\n\nFor other versions of usage-based pricing, see the\n[advanced](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based-legacy/pricing-models#advanced)\nmodels section. Also learn how to set up [free\ntrials](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based-legacy#trials)\nand other optional features for a usage-based billing integration.\n\n## Advanced pricing models\n\n### Flat rate and per-seat\n\nYou can subscribe the customer to two separate products to model a pricing\nstructure that includes both a base fee and additional per-seat pricing. One\nproduct serves as the flat base price and the other product represents the\nvariable per-seat pricing.\n\nTogethere charges a flat monthly rate for their service plus a tiered price for\nmore than 50 users.\n\n#### Model flat rate and per-seat on Stripe\n\nTo model this structure on Stripe, Togethere creates a **Product** and **Price**\nfor the base fee:\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/prices \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d nickname=\"Monthly Base Fee\" \\\n -d product={{BASE_FEE_PRODUCT_ID}} \\\n -d unit_amount=500 \\\n -d currency=usd \\\n -d \"recurring[interval]\"=month \\\n -d \"recurring[usage_type]\"=licensed\n```\n\nThen they create a monthly price that charges 15 USD per user:\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/prices \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d nickname=\"Per-seat price\" \\\n -d product={{PRODUCT_ID}} \\\n -d unit_amount=1500 \\\n -d currency=usd \\\n -d \"recurring[interval]\"=month \\\n -d \"recurring[usage_type]\"=licensed\n```\n\nHere’s how they subscribe a customer with three users to the base fee price and\nthe per-user price:\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscriptions \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d customer={{CUSTOMER_ID}} \\\n -d \"items[0][price]\"={{BASE_FEE_PRICE_ID}} \\\n -d \"items[0][quantity]\"=1 \\\n -d \"items[1][price]\"={{PER_SEAT_PRICE_ID}} \\\n -d \"items[1][quantity]\"=3\n```\n\nThis results in a 50 USD charge every month: the 5 USD base monthly rate, plus\n15 USD each for 3 users.\n\n### Flat rate with metered usage\n\nYou can also combine flat fees with usage-based pricing to charge a flat monthly\nrate in addition to charging for usage over the billing cycle.\n\nTo create a flat rate with a metered usage pricing model on Stripe through the\n[Products](https://docs.stripe.com/api/products) and\n[Prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices) APIs:\n\n- Create the `Flat monthly fee` product.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/products \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d name=Per-seat\n```\n- Create a price for the `Flat monthly fee` product.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/prices \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d product={{PRODUCT_ID}} \\\n -d unit_amount=1000 \\\n -d currency=usd \\\n -d \"recurring[interval]\"=month\n```\n- Create the `Meeting per minute usage` price.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/prices \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d nickname=\"Metered Monthly Plan\" \\\n -d product={{PRODUCT_ID}} \\\n -d unit_amount=700 \\\n -d currency=usd \\\n -d \"recurring[interval]\"=month \\\n -d \"recurring[usage_type]\"=metered\n```\n\nWhen you create subscriptions, specify both price IDs:\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscriptions \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d customer={{CUSTOMER_ID}} \\\n -d \"items[0][price]\"={{FLAT_MONTHLY_FEE_PRICE_ID}} \\\n -d \"items[0][quantity]\"=1 \\\n -d \"items[1][price]\"={{METERED_USAGE_PRICE_ID}} \\\n -d \"items[1][quantity]\"=1\n```\n\n### Decimal amounts\n\nDecimal pricing is useful if you need to create pricing amounts that aren’t\nwhole numbers. For example, if you’re running a cloud storage SaaS business, you\ncan create a price that charges 0.05 cents for each MB used per month. Based on\nusage, the quantity of MB is then multiplied by 0.05 cents and rounded to the\nnearest whole cent.\n\n#### Creating objects with decimal amounts\n\nTo [create prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_price) with decimal\namounts, specify `unit_amount_decimal` instead of `unit_amount`.\n`unit_amount_decimal` allows you to set the amount in the minor unit of the\ncurrency that you charge in. For example, you can set `unit_amount_decimal =\n105.5` in USD to represent 105.5 cents, or 1.055 USD. `unit_amount_decimal`\naccepts decimals up to 12 decimal places.\n\nIf you plan to use\n[tiers](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models#tiered-pricing),\nyou can specify `unit_amount_decimal` instead of `unit_amount`. You can also\n[create invoice items](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoiceitems/create) with\n`unit_amount_decimal` instead of `unit_amount`.\n\nIn API responses, the integer `unit_amount` field isn’t populated if the object\nis created with a decimal value. For example, if you create a price with\n`unit_amount_decimal = 0.05`, the response contains `unit_amount = null` and\n`unit_amount_decimal = 0.05`. You can still pass integer values into\n`unit_amount_decimal`, in which case `unit_amount` is populated in the response.\nFor instance, if you create a price with `unit_amount_decimal = 5`, the response\ncontains `unit_amount = 5` and `unit_amount_decimal = 5.0`.\n\n#### Note\n\nIf your integration has event handling that uses `unit_amount` values and you\nbegin using decimal amounts, you need to use `unit_amount_decimal` instead. This\nis important because `unit_amount` will be returned as `null` if the decimal\namounts can’t be converted into integers, which could cause errors in your\nintegration.\n\n## Links\n\n- [updated usage-based billing\ndocs](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based)\n-\n[migrate](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based-legacy/migration-guide)\n- [per-seat](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models#per-seat)\n- [flat rate](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models#flat-rate)\n- [record and report\nusage](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based-legacy/recording-usage)\n-\n[licensed](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/create#create_price-recurring-usage_type)\n- [prices\nguide](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/manage-prices#create-product)\n- [Product catalog](https://dashboard.stripe.com/products)\n- [customer portal](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management)\n- [quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/quotes)\n- [page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/subscriptions)\n- [create a Checkout\nsession](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/build-subscriptions?ui=stripe-hosted#create-session)\n- [create a\nCustomer](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/build-subscriptions?ui=elements#create-customer)\n- [free\ntrials](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based-legacy#trials)\n- [Products](https://docs.stripe.com/api/products)\n- [Prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices)\n- [create prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_price)\n- [tiers](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models#tiered-pricing)\n- [create invoice items](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoiceitems/create)",
