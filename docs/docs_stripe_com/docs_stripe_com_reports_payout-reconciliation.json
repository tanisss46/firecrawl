  "content": "# Payout reconciliation report\n\n## Reconcile each payout with the batch of transactions it settles.\n\nThe [Payout reconciliation](https://dashboard.stripe.com/reports/reconciliation)\nreport helps you match the payouts you receive in your bank account with the\nbatches of payments and other transactions that they relate to.\n\nThe payout reconciliation report is only available for users with **automatic\npayouts** enabled, and is optimized for users who prefer to reconcile the\ntransactions included in each payout as a settlement batch. If you use manual\npayouts or prefer to track and reconcile your Stripe balance like a bank\naccount, see the [Balance](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/balance) report\ninstead. To help you decide which report is right for you, see the [guide for\nselecting\nreports](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/select-a-report#reconciliation).\n\nTo get started, use the [controls](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/options) at\nthe top of the screen to select a date range.\n\nThe **Balance summary** section shows your starting and ending Stripe balance\nfor the selected date range, along with a high level summary of your activity\nduring the period.\n\nThe **Payout reconciliation** section provides a breakdown of the automatic\npayouts that were received in your bank account during the selected date range.\nThe transactions included in those settlement batches are grouped by [reporting\ncategory](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/reporting-categories).\n\nThe **Ending balance reconciliation** section provides a similar breakdown of\nthe transactions that hadn’t been settled as of the report’s end date.\n\n## Downloading data\n\nYou can download the data displayed in each section of the report as a CSV file\nby clicking the **Download** button in the upper right corner of that section.\nThe **Payout reconciliation** and **Ending balance reconciliation** sections\nallow you to download multiple types of reports:\n\n- **Summary**: This downloads data in CSV format exactly as you see it in the\ndashboard.\n- **Itemized**: This downloads the full list of individual transactions that are\nsummarized in the dashboard. You can include custom metadata associated with\nthose transactions to speed up the reconciliation process.\n\nIn addition, you can quickly download itemized data for a single category of\ntransactions by hovering over that category and clicking the **Download** button\nthat appears.\n\n## Available columns\n\nYou can customize the columns that appear in the reports when downloading them\nin the dashboard or via the [Reporting\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/api).
