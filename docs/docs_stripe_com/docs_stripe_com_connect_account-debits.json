  "content": "# Debit connected accounts\n\n## Collect funds from a connected account by debiting its Stripe balance.\n\nAt times, your platform might need to collect funds from your connected\naccounts:\n\n- To charge the connected account directly for products or services\n- To recover funds for a previous refund\n- To make other adjustments to connected [account\nbalances](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-balances) (for example, to\ncorrect an error)\n\nWhen your platform is responsible for negative balances, such as with Express\nand Custom connected accounts, you can debit a connected account’s Stripe\nbalance, transferring funds to your platform balance.\n\n#### Note\n\nTo bill connected accounts where Stripe is responsible for negative balances,\ncreate a customer for each connected account and [charge them using Stripe\nBilling\nsubscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/subscriptions#connected-account-platform).\n\nThis creates a `Transfer` on the connected account and a `Payment` on the\nplatform account.\n\n#### Caution\n\nUsing Account Debits requires getting legally binding consent from your\nconnected accounts. This feature is available in Australia, Canada, Europe, Hong\nKong, Japan, New Zealand, and the US. Stripe supports Account Debits only when\nboth your platform and the connected account are in the same region (for\nexample, both are in Japan). If you have interest in other regions, contact the\n[sales team](https://stripe.com/contact/sales). Using Account Debits incurs an\n[additional cost](https://stripe.com/connect/pricing).\n\n## Requirements\n\nThis functionality is only supported for connected accounts where your platform\nis responsible for negative balances, including Express and Custom accounts.\nAdditionally:\n\n- The connected account and the platform must be in the same region (that is,\nboth must be in Europe or in the US).\n- The `currency` value must match the default currency of the connected account.\n- Debiting an account can’t make the connected account balance become negative\nunless you have [reserves\nenabled](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-balances#understanding-connected-reserve-balances)\n(on by default for all new platforms created after January 31, 2017) and have a\nbank account in the same currency as the debit.\n- If a connected account has a [negative\nbalance](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-balances#accounting-for-negative-balances),\nStripe might auto-debit the external account on file, depending on what country\nthe connected account is in. If the external account hasn’t been verified, the\ndebit can fail.\n- The maximum `amount` is 100,000 USD (or equivalent in your currency).\n\n## Charging a connected account\n\nThe [create a charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_charge) API call\nsupports providing a connected account ID as the `source` value:\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/charges \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d amount=1500 \\\n -d currency=usd \\\n -d source={{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}\n```\n\nThe API call returns the `Payment` created on the platform account (note: it\ndoes not return a `Charge`).\n\nThis approach is appropriate for platforms that charge their connected accounts\nfor goods and services (that is, for using the platform). For example, a\nplatform can charge its connected accounts for additional fees or services\nthrough their Stripe balance, minimizing any need to collect an additional\npayment method and allowing for nearly instant availability of the funds.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Creating Direct Charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges)\n- [Creating Destination Charges on Your\nPlatform](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges)\n- [Creating Separate Charges and\nTransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## Links\n\n- [account balances](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-balances)\n- [charge them using Stripe Billing\nsubscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/subscriptions#connected-account-platform)\n- [sales team](https://stripe.com/contact/sales)\n- [additional cost](https://stripe.com/connect/pricing)\n- [reserves\nenabled](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-balances#understanding-connected-reserve-balances)\n- [negative\nbalance](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-balances#accounting-for-negative-balances)\n- [create a charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_charge)\n- [Creating Direct Charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges)\n- [Creating Destination Charges on Your\nPlatform](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges)\n- [Creating Separate Charges and\nTransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)",
