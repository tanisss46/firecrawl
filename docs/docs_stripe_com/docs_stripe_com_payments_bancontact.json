Customers use a Bancontact card or mobile app\nlinked to a Belgian bank account to make online payments.\n\nTo pay with Bancontact, customers are redirected to the Bancontact website or\nmobile app to [authorize the\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#customer-actions) and\nthen return to your website where there is [immediate\nnotification](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#payment-notification)\nabout the success or failure of the payment.\n\nPayment method propertiesBusiness locationsProduct support- **Customer\nlocations**\n\nBelgium\n- **Presentment currency**\n\nEUR\n- **Payment confirmation**\n\nCustomer-authenticated\n- **Payment method family**\n\nAuthenticated bank-debit\n- **Recurring payments**\n\nwith [SEPA Direct\nDebit](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/bancontact)\n- **Payout timing**\n\nStandard payout timing applies\n- **Connect support**\n\nYes\n- **Dispute support**\n\n[No](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bancontact#disputed-payments)\n- **Manual capture support**\n\nNo\n- **Refunds / Partial refunds**\n\n[Yes / Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bancontact#refunds)\n\n## Payment flows\n\n!\n\nCustomer selects Bancontact at checkout\n\n!\n\nCustomer is redirected to Bancontact and enters credentials\n\n!\n\nCustomer is notified that payment is complete\n\n!\n\n(Optional) Customer returns back to business’s site for payment confirmation\n\n!\n\nCustomer selects Bancontact at checkout\n\n!\n\nCustomer is redirected to Bancontact and scans QR code\n\n!\n\nCustomer enters pincode\n\n!\n\nCustomer is notified that payment is complete\n\n!\n\n(Optional) Customer returns back to business’s site for payment confirmation\n\n## Get started\n\nYou don’t have to integrate Bancontact and other payment methods individually.\nIf you use our front-end products, Stripe automatically determines the most\nrelevant payment methods to display. Go to the [Stripe\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and enable\nBancontact. To get started with one of our hosted UIs, follow a quickstart:\n\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart): Our prebuilt, hosted\ncheckout page.\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart): Our drop-in UI\ncomponents.\n\n### Other payment products\n\nThe following Stripe products also let you add Bancontact from the Dashboard:\n\n- [Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/no-code-guide)\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n\nIf you prefer to manually list payment methods or want to save Bancontact\ndetails for future payments, see the following guides:\n\n- [Manually configure Bancontact as a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bancontact/accept-a-payment)\n- [Save Bancontact details for future\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bancontact/set-up-payment)\n\n## Disputes\n\nThe risk of fraud or unrecognized payments is low because the customer must\nauthenticate the payment with their bank. As a result, you won’t have disputes\nthat turn into chargebacks, with funds withdrawn from your Stripe account.\n\n## Refunds\n\nBancontact payments can be refunded up to 180 days after the original payment\ndate.\n\n## Links\n\n- [pricing details](https://stripe.com/pricing/local-payment-methods)\n- [authorize the\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#customer-actions)\n- [immediate\nnotification](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#payment-notification)\n- [SEPA Direct Debit](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/bancontact)\n- [No](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bancontact#disputed-payments)\n- [Yes / Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bancontact#refunds)\n- [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods)\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart)\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart)\n- [Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/no-code-guide)\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n- [Manually configure Bancontact as a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bancontact/accept-a-payment)\n- [Save Bancontact details for future\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bancontact/set-up-payment)",
