  "content": "# Collect on-reader tips\n\nWith on-reader tipping, you can display suggested tip amounts on the reader\nbefore the customer presents their payment method. The reader shows the customer\nthree suggestions based on the [tipping\noption](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/collecting-tips/on-reader#customize-tips-reader)\nthat you set up. The reader automatically shows a tipping selection screen on\nevery call to collect a payment. When you [confirm the\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/collect-card-payment#confirm-payment),\nthe `PaymentIntent` is confirmed for an amount inclusive of the selected tip.\n\nPayment screen\n\nTipping selection screen (percentage)\n\nTotal screen\n\nApproved screen\n\n### Availability\n\n**Readers**: [Stripe Reader\nS700](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/readers/stripe-reader-s700), [BBPOS\nWisePOS E](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/readers/bbpos-wisepos-e), [BBPOS\nWisePad 3](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/readers/bbpos-wisepad3)\n\n## Enable and customize on-reader tipping\n\nUse a [Configuration](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/configuration) object\nto set the tipping configuration for your reader:\n\n- Suggest smart tips—The reader dynamically shows three percentages or amounts,\ndepending on the size of the pre-tip amount.\n- Suggest percentages—The reader displays three percentage-based tip amounts.\n- Suggest amounts—The reader displays three tip amounts.\n\nTo use the on-reader tipping feature on your BBPOS WisePad 3, you must use one\nof the following Terminal SDK versions:\n\n- Android SDK 2.8.1 or greater\n- iOS SDK 2.16.1 or greater\nSuggest smart tipsSuggest percentagesSuggest amounts\nYou can suggest three tip percentages or three tip amounts on the reader. The\nreader dynamically displays either of these smart tips, depending on a pre-tip\namount threshold. Create or update a `Configuration` object as follows. The tips\nyou collect with on-reader tipping are post-tax tips.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/terminal/configurations \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d \"tipping[usd][percentages][]\"=15 \\\n -d \"tipping[usd][percentages][]\"=20 \\\n -d \"tipping[usd][percentages][]\"=25 \\\n -d \"tipping[usd][fixed_amounts][]\"=100 \\\n -d \"tipping[usd][fixed_amounts][]\"=200 \\\n -d \"tipping[usd][fixed_amounts][]\"=300 \\\n -d \"tipping[usd][smart_tip_threshold]\"=1000\n```\n\nWith the above example, the reader dynamically chooses what to suggest:\n\n- If the pre-tip amount is below the `smart_tip_threshold` (10 USD), the reader\nshows three buttons suggesting $1, $2, or $3 tips from top to bottom.\n- If the pre-tip amount is at the `smart_tip_threshold` (10 USD) or above, the\nreader shows three buttons suggesting tips that are 15%, 20%, or 25% of the\npre-tip total from top to bottom.\n\nIf specifying more than one currency in your `Configuration` object, you must\nprovide the same configuration keys for each currency. In other words, if you\nonly specify `percentages` for `USD`, you can’t specify `fixed_amounts` or\n`smart_tip_threshold` for any other currencies.\n\nAfter you create a `Configuration` object with your tipping configuration, you\ncan [assign the\nconfiguration](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/fleet/configurations-overview?dashboard-or-api=api#create-a-configuration-for-an-individual-location)\nto your account or a location. BBPOS WisePad 3 readers receive new or updated\nconfigurations when they connect to your POS application. BBPOS WisePOS E\nreaders can take up to 5 minutes to receive new or updated configurations.\n\n## Collect payment\n\nFor on-reader tipping, follow the instructions for [collecting\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/collect-card-payment) and\ncreate your `PaymentIntent` with `capture_method` as `manual`.\n\nWhen you [collect a payment\nmethod](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/collect-card-payment#collect-payment),\nyour customer sees a tip selection screen on the reader that prompts them to\nselect a tip before asking for their payment method.\n\nDepending on your [tipping\nconfiguration](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/collecting-tips/on-reader#customize-tips-reader),\nthe customer can choose a suggested tip, specify a custom tip, or leave no tip.\n\nAfter the customer makes their selection, the reader waits for them to present a\ncard.\n\nWhen you process the payment, the reader adds the selected tip. If the payment\nis successful, the\n[amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-amount)\nin the `PaymentIntent` and `Charge` updates to include the tip amount.\n\nBefore a PaymentIntent confirmation, the tip amount returns in the `amount_tip`\nfield but not in the `amount`. After PaymentIntent confirmation, the\n`amount_tip` field is set to zero, the `amount` includes the tip amount, and the\ntip amount returns in the\n[amount_details](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-amount_details)\nobject:\n\nScenario[amount_details.tip.amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-amount_details-tip-amount)\nreturn valueOn-reader tipping is disabled`null`On-reader tipping is enabled, no\ntip selected`0`On-reader tipping is enabled, tip amount selectedThe amount\nselected\nCustomers won’t see a tipping selection screen in these cases:\n\n- The `Configuration` object is missing a tipping configuration.\n- You enabled `skipTipping` in your tipping configuration.\n- The reader is in an unsupported country.\n- A tipping configuration can’t be applied to the current payment currency. For\nexample, if the payment is in EUR but the `Configuration` object only specifies\na tipping configuration for USD.\n\nWhen [testing\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/references/testing#physical-test-cards)\nwith the Stripe reader, the total amount (inclusive of any tip) might trigger\ndecline responses depending on the decimal value of the total amount.\n\n## Skip tipping\n\nYou can ignore the tipping configuration, which allows you to hide the tip\nselection screen on your reader when collecting payments.\n\nYou can hide the tip selection screen for individual transactions or temporarily\nfor all transactions, which allows your customers to go directly to the card\npresentment screen.\n\nFor example, your restaurant might want to accept tips on the reader for takeout\norders, but only allow [on-receipt\ntips](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/collecting-tips/on-receipt) for\ndine-in customers.\n\nUse one of the following options to enable bypassing the tip selection screen:\n\nServer-drivenJavaScriptiOSAndroidReact Native\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/terminal/readers/tmr_xxx/process_payment_intent \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d payment_intent=\"<payment_intent>\" \\\n -d \"process_config[skip_tipping]\"=true\n```\n\n## Tip-eligible amounts\n\n!\n\n#### Note\n\n[Contact us](mailto:stripe-terminal-betas@stripe.com) if you’re interested in\ntip-eligible amounts on a [BBPOS WisePad\n3](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/readers/bbpos-wisepad3).\n\nWhen collecting a payment, you can set a tip-eligible amount that’s different\nfrom the pre-tip amount. Setting a tip-eligible amount changes the value that\npercentage-based tips are calculated from. The customer is also shown the\ntip-eligible amount alongside the pre-tip amount on the tip selection screen.\n\nYou can use this setting for businesses that provide services in addition to\nselling goods. For example, a salon that sells haircuts and bottles of shampoo\nmight want their customer to know that they calculate percentage-based tips on\nhaircuts only.\n\nServer-drivenJavaScriptiOSAndroidReact Native\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/terminal/readers/tmr_xxx/process_payment_intent \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d payment_intent=\"<payment_intent>\" \\\n -d \"process_config[tipping][amount_eligible]\"=1500\n```\n\nThe above example sets a tip-eligible amount based on the currency of the\npayment. For a payment in USD, the tip-eligible amount is 15 USD.\n\nThe value of `eligible_amount` must be 0 or higher. If `eligible_amount` is\nequal to 0, tipping is skipped regardless of the value of `skip_tipping`. If\n`eligible_amount` is equal to the PaymentIntent amount, `eligible_amount` is\nignored and the tip is calculated based on the specified amount.\n\n#### Common mistake\n\nSetting a tip-eligible amount that’s greater than 0 while attempting to skip\ntipping results in an error.\n\n## Links\n\n- [tipping\noption](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/collecting-tips/on-reader#customize-tips-reader)\n- [confirm the\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/collect-card-payment#confirm-payment)\n- [Stripe Reader\nS700](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/readers/stripe-reader-s700)\n- [BBPOS WisePOS E](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/readers/bbpos-wisepos-e)\n- [BBPOS WisePad 3](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/readers/bbpos-wisepad3)\n- [Configuration](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/configuration)\n- [assign the\nconfiguration](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/fleet/configurations-overview?dashboard-or-api=api#create-a-configuration-for-an-individual-location)\n- [collecting\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/collect-card-payment)\n- [collect a payment\nmethod](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/collect-card-payment#collect-payment)\n-\n[amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-amount)\n-\n[amount_details](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-amount_details)\n-\n[amount_details.tip.amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-amount_details-tip-amount)\n- [testing\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/references/testing#physical-test-cards)\n- [on-receipt\ntips](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/collecting-tips/on-receipt)",
