Go to the [Stripe\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and enable\nWeChat Pay. To get started with one of our hosted UIs, follow a quickstart:\n\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart): Our prebuilt, hosted\ncheckout page.\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart): Our drop-in UI\ncomponents.\n\n### Other payment products\n\nThe following Stripe products also let you add WeChat Pay from the Dashboard:\n\n- [Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/no-code-guide)\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n- [Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview)\n\nIf your integration requires manually listing payment methods, learn how to\n[manually configure WeChat Pay as a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/wechat-pay/accept-a-payment).\n\n## Disputes\n\nWeChat payments have a low risk of fraud or unrecognized payments because the\ncustomer must authenticate the payment with the WeChat Pay app. Therefore, there\nis no dispute process that can result in a chargeback and funds being withdrawn\nfrom your Stripe account.\n\n## Refunds\n\nPayments made with WeChat Pay can only be submitted for refund within 180 days\nfrom the date of the original charge. After 180 days, it’s no longer possible to\nrefund the charge. Refunds for WeChat Pay payments are asynchronous. Stripe\nnotifies you of the final refund status using the `refund.updated` or\n`refund.failed` [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) event. When a refund\nsucceeds, the [Refund](https://docs.stripe.com/api/refunds/object) object’s\nstatus transitions to `succeeded`. If a refund fails, the Refund object’s status\ntransitions to `failed` and Stripe returns the amount to your Stripe balance.\nYou then need to arrange an alternative way of providing your customer with a\nrefund.\n\n## Supported currencies\n\nYou can create WeChat Pay payments in the currencies that map to your country.\nThe default local currency for WeChat Pay is `cny` and customers also see their\npurchase amount in `cny`.\n\nCurrencyCountry`cny`All countries`aud`Australia`cad`Canada`eur`Austria, Belgium,\nDenmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands,\nNorway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland`gbp`United Kingdom`hkd`Hong\nKong`jpy`Japan`sgd`Singapore`usd`United\nStates`dkk`Denmark`nok`Norway`sek`Sweden`chf`Switzerland\n## Connect\n\nWechat Pay has partial [Connect](https://stripe.com/connect) support depending\non the [charge type](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges).\n\nThe following charge types are generally available.\n\n- Destination charges\n- Separate charges and transfers\n\nThe following charge types are in private preview.\n\n- Direct charges\n- `on_behalf_of`\n\nFor connected accounts with standard Dashboard access, individual connected\naccounts can enable Wechat Pay in the Dashboard.\n\nFor connected accounts without standard Dashboard access, the platform needs to\nrequest the `wechat_pay_payments` capability.
