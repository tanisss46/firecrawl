After successfully\nconfirming a PaymentIntent, the `brand_product` field also includes the product\ncode in the\n[payment_method_details](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-payment_method_details)\nfor the corresponding charge in the API response for\n[card_present](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-payment_method_details-card_present)\npayments (using [Terminal](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal)).\n\nThe `brand_product` field might be `null` if the product code hasn’t been\ncollected yet (for example, when creating a card) or the product codes for the\nparticular card network aren’t supported. We currently support Visa and\nMastercard product codes only.\n\n## Product codes\n\nThe following table lists product code values for each card brand:\n\nVisaMastercardProduct code Product description ATraditionalBTraditional\nRewardsCSignatureDSignature PreferredDSDistributionFClassicF2Visa Flexible\nCredentialF3Visa Flexible Credential StandardGBusinessG1Signature\nBusinessG3Platinum BusinessG4Infinite BusinessG5Business RewardsGVGovernment\nDisbursementIInfiniteI1Infinite\nPrivilegeI2UHNWJ3HealthcareKCorporateK1Government\nCorporateLElectronNPlatinumN1RewardsN2SelectPGoldPPPayrollQPrivate\nLabelQ2Private Label BasicQ3Private Label StandardQ4Private Label\nEnhancedQ5Private Label SpecializedQ6Private Label\nPremiumRProprietarySPurchasingS1Purchasing With FleetS2Government\nPurchasingS3Government Purchasing With FleetS4Commercial AgricultureS5Commercial\nTransportS6Commercial MarketplaceS7DistributionUTravel MoneyVV PayXVisa\nCommercial Choice TravelX1Visa Commercial Choice Omni\n## Testing\n\nWhile in test mode, use the following test cards to simulate purchases made with\nspecific card product codes, which are returned in the `brand_product` field.\nEach test card takes any future date as the expiration, any three-digit value as\nthe CVV, and any postal code.\n\nDescription NumberProduct codeMastercard Standard\nDebit5555050360000007MDSMastercard Platinum Debit5555050360000015MDPMastercard\nWorld Credit5200000360000076MCWMastercard World Elite\nCredit5200000360000068MWEMastercard World Elite for Business\nCredit5200500000100004MAB\n\n## Links\n\n- [Payment Intents API](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents)\n- [PaymentMethod](https://docs.stripe.com/api#payment_methods)\n-\n[payment_method_details](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-payment_method_details)\n-\n[card_present](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-payment_method_details-card_present)\n- [Terminal](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal)",
