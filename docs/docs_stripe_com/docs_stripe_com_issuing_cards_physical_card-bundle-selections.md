# Card bundle options

## Make your card bundle selections.

During the design phase, Stripe provides a design form where you can choose from
the following standard options. Additionally, there are many innovative products
in the physical cards market, such as LED-powered cards that light up in
point-of-sale terminals, wooden cards, and recycled ocean plastic cards. These
options are outside our standard offerings, but we can arrange expert-driven
sessions to help you learn more about them.
