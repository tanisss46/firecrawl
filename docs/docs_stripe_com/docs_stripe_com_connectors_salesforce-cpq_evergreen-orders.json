Evergreen orders are subscriptions in Salesforce\nthat have no end date, as opposed to renewable orders, which are recurring\nsubscriptions that have a set end date.\n\nThe connector examines `SBQQ_SubscriptionType__c` to determine if an order is\nRenewable or Evergreen. A Salesforce order with an `Evergreen` subscription type\nsyncs into a Stripe subscription, regardless of the value for\n`SBQQ_ProductSubscriptionType__c`, which could be Renewable, or Renewable and\nEvergreen.\n\n## Requirements\n\nSet the `collection_method` field to `send_invoice` and specify a value for\n`days_until_due` on the Stripe subscription. You can map to these fields in the\ndata mapper.\n\nSet `SBQQ_DefaultSubscriptionTerm__c` on the Salesforce evergreen order to `1`.\nTo prevent unexpected behavior on the invoices, make sure the evergreen order\nhas a default subscription term equal to 1.\n\n## Cancel evergreen orders\n\nYou can cancel evergreen orders in Salesforce by making an order amendment with\nquantity zero and setting the cancellation date as the start date.\n\nTo cancel a Stripe subscription immediately, set the amendment start date to the\ncurrent date. To cancel a Stripe subscription on a specific date, set the\namendment start date to a date in the future.\n\nIf you cancel a subscription during a billing period, the subscription cancels\nimmediately and the customer won’t receive a credit or refund for the remainder\nof the billing period.\n\n## Limitations\n\nThe connector doesn’t sync Salesforce orders that contain both evergreen and\nnon-evergreen products.\n\nThe connector only supports canceling Salesforce evergreen orders with one\nproduct. Attempting to cancel a subset of the products in an evergreen order\ncancels the entire Stripe subscription. We recommend creating separate\nSalesforce evergreen orders for each product, if you want the ability to cancel\norders in Stripe.\n\nYou must set the `collection_method` on a Stripe subscription to `send_invoice`.\nThe default value is `charge_automatically`, but the connector doesn’t support\ncollecting customer payment methods, which is necessary to charge automatically.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Field defaults and custom\nmappings](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/salesforce-cpq/field-mappings)\n- [Order\namendments](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/salesforce-cpq/subscription-order-amendments)\n- [Subscription\norders](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/salesforce-cpq/subscriptions)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Field defaults and custom\nmappings](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/salesforce-cpq/field-mappings)\n- [Order\namendments](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/salesforce-cpq/subscription-order-amendments)\n- [Subscription\norders](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/salesforce-cpq/subscriptions)",
