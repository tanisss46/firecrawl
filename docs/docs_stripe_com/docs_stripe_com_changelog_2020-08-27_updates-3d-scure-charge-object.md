# Updates to 3D Secure details in Charge objectBreaking changes

## What’s new

Updates the `payment_method_details.card.three_d_secure` fields on the `Charge`
object, and removes the `succeeded` and `authenticated` booleans. Use the
`result` enum instead.

## Impact

Lets you more accurately determine the 3D Secure status of a payment by using
the new `result` enum in the `payment_method_details.card.three_d_secure` fields
of the `Charge` object. The previous `succeeded` and `authenticated` booleans
have been removed, providing a more granular and comprehensive way to understand
the 3D Secure authentication process for a given payment.
