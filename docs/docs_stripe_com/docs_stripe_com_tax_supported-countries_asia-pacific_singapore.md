# Collect tax in Singapore

## Learn how to use Stripe Tax to calculate, collect, and report tax in Singapore.

In Singapore, Stripe Tax supports calculation and collection of
[GST](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)).

## When to register for tax collection

See [Thresholds](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/thresholds) to get insights
about your potential tax registration obligations in Singapore. Stripe also
notifies you with email and Dashboard alerts when you need to register to
collect tax. Learn more about how the [monitoring tool
works](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/monitoring).

Remote sellers must register for GST if the Singaporean taxable turnover
exceeded 1 million SGD in the past 12 months (retrospective basis) or is likely
to exceed 1 million SGD in the next 12 months (prospective basis).

A special registration rule applies to remote sellers of digital services. As of
Jan 1, 2020, non-resident suppliers must register under the Overseas Vendor
Registration regime if in a calendar year:

- They have a global turnover exceeding 1 million SGD.
- They make B2C supplies of digital services to customers in Singapore exceeding
100,000 SGD. Global turnover refers to all supplies made that would be taxable
supplies if made in Singapore.

Stripe only monitors the 100,000 SGD threshold of the Overseas Vendor
Registration.

### Domestic Registration

**Threshold**: 1 million SGD **Time frame**: Previous or current year.
**Included transactions**: Any taxable transactions that reverse charge doesn’t
apply to.

### Overseas Vendor Registration

**Threshold**: 100,000 SGD and 1 million SGD (global turnover) **Time frame**:
Calendar year. **Included transactions**: For the 100,000 SGD threshold,
Business-to-consumer (B2C) sales of digital goods or electronically supplied
services (digital products)

## How we calculate taxes

Stripe calculates GST for your transactions in Singapore.

Generally, most transactions are taxable in the jurisdiction where your customer
is. Stripe assumes the sale of most goods or services to be taxable unless
specifically exempted.

## Report and file your taxes

Stripe provides reports of your completed tax transactions. Go to
[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations) to access these
reports. Learn more about [the different types of
reports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports).

You’re responsible for filing and remitting your taxes to Singapore. Stripe
doesn’t file taxes on your behalf. However, we do have trusted partners who can
help manage your filing and remittance.
