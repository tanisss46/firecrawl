# Subscriptions now only report the timestamp for API or invoice payment failures for the canceled_at fieldBreaking changes

## What’s new

Updates the `canceled_at` property on the `Subscription` object to always be the
timestamp from the API call or invoice payment failure that canceled the
subscription. Previously, `canceled_at` reflected “at period end” subscription
cancellations, too. The `ended_at` property still reflects the time that the
subscription actually stopped.

## Impact

The `canceled_at` property on the `Subscription` object now consistently
represents actual cancellation time.
