It\nuses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) or USB (Android only) to\n[connect](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/connect-reader?reader-type=bluetooth)\nto the Stripe Terminal SDK on a mobile device. The WisePad 3 features a display\nand PIN pad, which facilitates use in countries where PIN-authenticated\ntransactions are more common.\n\nThis reader is compatible with our iOS, Android, and React Native SDKs. To view\nthe reader’s parts and features, see the [BBPOS WisePad 3 product\nsheet](https://d37ugbyn3rpeym.cloudfront.net/terminal/product-sheets/wp3_product_sheet.pdf).\n\n#### Warning\n\nStripe readers aren’t liquid-proof and we recommend that users make appropriate\nefforts to make sure their devices remain dry. If your device has experienced\nliquid ingress, we recommend that you stop using the device and let it dry\nthoroughly before attempting to re-use or charge the device. If your device\ndoesn’t properly operate or charge properly after drying, you need to replace\nit.\n\n## Turn the reader on and off\n\nYou can turn on the BBPOS WisePad 3 reader by pressing and holding the power\nbutton, located at the top right of the PIN pad. The display powers on and shows\nthe device’s splash screen.\n\nThe display dims after a few seconds of inactivity. If inactive and disconnected\nfrom your application for more than 5 minutes, it beeps and powers off. Turn off\nthe reader manually by pressing and holding the power button until the LED\ndisplay shows a “Power off?” prompt, then press the green enter button to\nconfirm.\n\n#### Note\n\nWith typical usage, you generally need to [charge the\nreader](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/setup-reader/bbpos-wisepad3#charging)\nonce per day. The reader can typically accept approximately 600 contact or 800\ncontactless transactions in a single charge cycle.\n\n## Charge the reader\n\nTo charge the BBPOS WisePad 3, use the included cable or a USB-A to USB-C cable.\n\n## Default reader language\n\nThe [BBPOS WisePad 3](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/readers/bbpos-wisepad3)\nsupports changing reader language directly in the reader interface. After you\nhave registered your reader to a\n[Location](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/locations), the reader installs\na language pack relevant for your region if one isn’t already in place.
