  "content": "# Single sign-on with Auth0Public preview\n\n## Learn how to setup single sign-on in the Dashboard with Auth0.\n\nStripe supports Single Sign-On (SSO), allowing you to manage your team’s access\nand roles through your identity provider (IdP). This means your team can access\nStripe without needing separate passwords. When SSO is configured, users (team\nmembers) are automatically redirected to your IdP for authentication when they\nsign in to Stripe.\n\nYour IdP verifies if they have a valid role assignment to your Stripe accounts\nor [organization](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/orgs/sso), and\ngenerates a SAML assertion used by Stripe to assign the proper roles in the\nStripe Dashboard. When your account requires SSO, you must update team roles\nthrough your Identity Provider (IdP) for security. Changes to a team member’s\nroles only appear in Stripe after they sign in to the Dashboard again using the\nupdated SAML assertion.\n\n## Set up SSO\n\nTo integrate your Stripe account with your IdP, complete these steps:\n\n- [Prove ownership of the\ndomains](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/sso/v2/auth0#proving-domain-verification)\nthat your team uses to sign in to the Dashboard.\n- [Configure\nAuth0](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/sso/v2/auth0#configuring-your-identity-provider)\nto work with Stripe.\n- [Configure\nStripe](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/sso/v2/auth0#configure-stripe)\nto work with Auth0.\n[Proving Domain\nOwnership](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/sso/v2/auth0#proving-domain-verification)\nA domain is the portion of an email address after the `@` symbol (such as\n`kavholm.com`). You must configure SSO for Stripe for each of your business’s\nemail domains. To verify domain ownership:\n\n- Navigate to [User\nauthentication](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/security/authentication)\nin the Stripe Dashboard, and click **+ New domain** to view your account’s\nunique verification code.\n```\n stripe-verification=4242424242424242424242\n\n```\n- Add the verification code as a `TXT` record to your Domain Name System (DNS)\nprovider.\n- Return to the Stripe Dashboard, and click **Save and verify**. Depending on\nyour DNS provider, it can take 24 hours or more to verify your domain.\n- After successful verification, don’t delete the `TXT` record from your DNS\nprovider. If you delete it, you might lose access to the Dashboard because\nStripe frequently checks the DNS records of your domain.\n\n#### Multiple Stripe accounts support\n\nIf you’re configuring SSO for multiple Stripe accounts, you must create an\n[organization](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/orgs) to centrally\nconfigure SSO across all of your accounts. Alternatively, contact [Stripe\nsupport](https://support.stripe.com/) to verify your domain across separate\naccounts with one shared verification code.\n\n[Configuring\nAuth0](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/sso/v2/auth0#configuring-your-identity-provider)\nFollow these steps to create an application.\n\n- Create a new application to represent the relationship between Auth0 and the\nStripe Dashboard. To do this, navigate to your Auth0 dashboard and click\n**Create Application**.\n\n![Auth0\ndashboard](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/auth0_create_application.7b6f15263843de76df131e481f7955a5.png)\n\n- Set the **Name** field and then select **Regular Web Applications**. Select\n**Create** to make your Auth0 application for Stripe authentication.\n\n![creating an application on\nAuth0](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/auth0_new_application.6ec3142f2df9f391b7f442ced92630d0.png)\n\n- Navigate to the **Addons** tab and select **SAML2 web app**.\n\n![activating SAML on an Auth0\napplication](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/auth0_navigate_to_addons.d7d7fa5fb2e17fc0b0399eeab8321ff8.png)\n\n- In the window that opens, set\n`https://dashboard.stripe.com/login/saml/consume` as the **Application Callback\nURL**.\n- Replace the contents of the **Settings** box with the following JSON\ninformation and then select **Enable**.\n\n```\n{\n \"audience\": \"https://dashboard.stripe.com/saml/metadata\",\n \"recipient\": \"https://dashboard.stripe.com/login/saml/consume\",\n \"mappings\": {\n\"email\": \"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/nameidentifier\"\n },\n \"signatureAlgorithm\": \"rsa-sha256\",\n \"digestAlgorithm\": \"sha256\",\n \"destination\": \"https://dashboard.stripe.com/login/saml/consume\",\n \"signResponse\": false,\n\"nameIdentifierFormat\":\n\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress\",\n \"nameIdentifierProbes\": [\n \"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/emailaddress\"\n ]\n}\n```\n\n### Assign roles to your team\n\nThe following setup is an example of how to set up dynamic roles. As long as the\nSAML Response contains the appropriate fields, Stripe grants the corresponding\nroles in the Stripe Dashboard. See Auth0’s documentation for more information on\ndynamic roles.\n\n- In the **Auth Pipeline section**, navigate to the **Rules** section, and then\nselect **Create Rule**.\n\n![rules on the Auth0\ndashboard](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/auth0_rules.b2453159ff14fa9990f3540dc0a8b0a2.png)\n\n- Choose the **empty rule** template, at the beginning of the page.\n\n![creating an empty rule on\nAuth0](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/auth0_empty_rule_template.54a70bae08bdf3f457938d012eb3b6fd.png)\n\n- Set your rule name (for example, “SAML attribute mapping”) and then paste the\nfollowing JavaScript code in the online editor. Then, click **Save**.\n\nThis script configures the Stripe roles you want to support in the Stripe\nDashboard per Stripe account. You *must* include your team members’ roles as an\nattribute statement in any assertion that you send to Stripe. You can\ndynamically assign your team members different sets of roles per Stripe account.\nIn the snippet example provided, Stripe assigns a newly signed-in user the\ndefault role `view_only`. If a user’s assertion doesn’t contain any role\nattribute statements, that user can’t log in through their identity provider.\n\n```\nfunction (user, context, callback) {\n // If there's no user app_metadata, create it.\n if (typeof (user.app_metadata) === 'undefined') {\n user.app_metadata = {};\n }\n\n // If the user doesn't have roles for the account, add a default value.\n if (typeof (user.app_metadata.) === 'undefined') {\n user.app_metadata. = ['view_only'];\n }\n\n // Add a mapping from app_metadata to the required SAML attribute.\n context.samlConfiguration.mappings = {\n \"Stripe-Role-\": \"app_metadata.\"\n };\n\n callback(null, user, context);\n}\n```\n\n- Navigate to the **Users** tab, where you can assign team member roles for your\napplication.\n\nYou can also override the Stripe Dashboard roles for your team members by\nupdating the `app_metadata` field on Auth0. Set the metadata value to the [roles\nfor your team members](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/team). Add entries\nfor each Stripe account that needs access.\n\n![user details on\nAuth0](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/auth0_user_metadata.89d76126775577363ddbd3f0d748e2f0.png)\n\nStripe supports the following roles. Some of these roles are only available if\nyour account uses the applicable Stripe product.

The team member has the both `analyst` and `developer` roles for the\nfirst account, and the role `view_only` for the second account.\n\n```\n{\n \"acct_1234\": [\n \"analyst\",\n \"developer\"\n ],\n \"acct_5678\": [\n \"view_only\",\n ]\n}\n```\n\nYou can find the list of account tokens in the **Accounts** section of your\n[Stripe Profile](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/user).\n\n[Configuring\nStripe](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/sso/v2/auth0#configure-stripe)\nConfigure your Stripe account to connect to your identity provider from the\n[User authentication](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/user_authentication)\npage.\n\nTo configure Stripe to connect to your identity provider you need:\n\n- **Issuer ID**: An identifier of your identity provider.\n- **Identity provider URL**: The URL of your identity provider that your team\nmembers are redirected to, so they can authenticate.\n- **Identity provider certificate**: The X.509 certificate that your identity\nprovider uses to signs assertions.\n\n#### Find these values in your identity provider\n\nIn **Auth0**, navigate to the settings in the **Applications** menu. Select your\napplication name, then navigate to the **Addons** tab, select the **SAML2**\nbutton, then select the **Usage** tab.\n\nName of property in StripeName of property in Auth0Issuer IDIssuerIdentity\nprovider URLIdentity Provider Login URLIdentity provider certificateAuth0\ncertificate\n#### Test your configuration\n\nBefore saving your settings, a test runs to validate your SSO integration. After\nyou click the **Test** button, a window opens in your browser that redirects to\nyour identity provider to sign in. After you sign in, the window automatically\ncloses and test results display on the original page.\n\nIf the test succeeds, you can save the settings, and select an enforcement mode.\nIf the test fails, modify your configuration to address the issues reported and\ntest the integration again.\n\n#### Select an enforcement mode for SSO\n\nWhen using SSO, there are three separate enforcement modes that you can choose\nfrom. These affect which methods of authentication your team members can use.\n\nModeSSO authentication allowedRegular authentication\nallowedOffNoYesOptionalYesYesRequired[Authenticate with\nSSO](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/sso/v2/auth0#authenticate-sso)\nAfter you finish configuring SSO, you can inform your users to sign in with any\nof these methods:\n\n### Stripe’s sign in page\n\nUsers can navigate to the [Stripe sign in\npage](https://dashboard.stripe.com/login), enter their email, then select **Use\nsingle sign-on (SSO)**.\n\nIf a user has access to multiple accounts, Stripe authenticates them with the\ndefault account connected to the user. If a user only has access to SAML\nmerchants, or doesn’t have access to any merchants, Stripe redirects them to the\nIdP, regardless of the contents in the password field.\n\n### IdP-initiated login\n\nTo use IdP-initiated login, your [IdP needs to support Service\nProvider-initiated\nlogin](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/sso/troubleshooting). Verify\nif this is possible using your IdP’s documentation.\n\n### SSO URL\n\nUse the following login URL with your domain to directly sign in to your account\nwith SSO. This URL includes the domain and account you want to use for SSO\nauthentication. If you change the account token at the end of the URL, it\nauthenticates you against a different account.\n\n```\n\nhttps://dashboard.stripe.com/login/saml_direct/domain/{{YOUR_DOMAIN}}/merchant/{{STRIPE_ACCOUNT_ID}}\n\n```\n\n#### Support for multiple Stripe accounts\n\nIf you’re configuring SSO for multiple Stripe accounts, first create an\n[organization](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/orgs) to centrally\nconfigure SSO across all of your accounts. You can change the account token at\nthe end of the SSO URL to authenticate against another account. You can find the\nlist of account tokens in the **Accounts** section of your\n[Profile](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/user).\n\n**Multiple IdP connections:** If you have multiple Stripe businesses with\nmultiple IdP settings (for example, different SAML endpoints or issuer IDs) but\nshare the same domain, we recommend using login URLs.\n\n## Revoke team member access\n\nYou can revoke a team member’s access using either active or passive methods.\n\n### Actively revoke access with an assertion\n\nSend Stripe an assertion from your identity provider to grant a team member\naccess to specific Stripe accounts. This also lets you revoke a team member’s\naccess. To revoke access for a team member, assign them a role of `none` for the\nStripe account’s access you want to revoke. For example:\n\n```\n<saml2:attribute name=\"Stripe-Role-STRIPE-ACCOUNT-ID\"\nNameFormat=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:basic\">\n <saml2:attributevalue>none\n </saml2:attributevalue>\n</saml2:attribute>\n```\n\n#### Caution\n\nYou can’t revoke access for the owner of a Stripe account.\n\n### Passively revoke access with enforcement mode\n\nWhen **enforcement mode** is set to **required**, only team members who can\nauthenticate with your identity provider can access your Stripe account. In\n**required** mode, you can revoke a team member’s access to a Stripe account by\npreventing your identity provider from authenticating them. In the Stripe\nDashboard, set SSO to **required** in [User\nauthentication](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/user_authentication).\n\n## Links\n\n- [organization](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/orgs/sso)\n- [User\nauthentication](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/security/authentication)\n- [organization](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/orgs)\n- [Stripe support](https://support.stripe.com/)\n-\n[https://dashboard.stripe.com/saml/metadata](https://dashboard.stripe.com/saml/metadata)\n-\n[https://dashboard.stripe.com/login/saml/consume](https://dashboard.stripe.com/login/saml/consume)\n-\n[http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/nameidentifier](http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/nameidentifier)\n-\n[http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/emailaddress](http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/emailaddress)\n- [roles for your team members](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/team)\n- [User roles supported by\nStripe](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/teams/roles)\n- [Stripe Profile](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/user)\n- [User\nauthentication](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/user_authentication)\n- [Stripe sign in page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/login)\n- [IdP needs to support Service Provider-initiated\nlogin](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/sso/troubleshooting)",
