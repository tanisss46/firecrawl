You\ncan edit this property on accounts where you [own fraud and dispute\nliability](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/accounts).\n\nThis field is useful for dictating automatic payouts. Stripe calculates the\ndelay in business days or calendar days based on the [connected accounts’\ncountry](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts#standard-payout-timing). For example,\nif you want a connected account based in Singapore (which uses calendar day\ndelays) to receive their funds two weeks after the charge is made, set\n`interval` to `daily` and `delay_days` to **14**. When setting or updating this\nfield, you can pass the string `minimum` to choose the lowest permitted value.\n\nFor accounts where Stripe manages fraud and dispute liability (for example,\nStandard accounts), the default is the lowest permitted value for the account,\ndetermined by the [connected account’s\ncountry](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts#standard-payout-timing). If you’re\nopted into [accelerated payout\nspeeds](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts#accelerated-payout-speeds), the value\nuses the accelerated timing. You can request to lower this by contacting [Stripe\nSupport](https://support.stripe.com/contact). For accounts where you own fraud\nand dispute liability, the value remains at your original payout speed by\ndefault.\n\n## Interval property\n\nPlatforms that manage fraud and dispute liability, or have [platform\ncontrols](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/platform-controls-for-stripe-dashboard-accounts#control-payout-timing),\ncan adjust the payout interval. There are four possible settings for the\n`interval` property:\n\n- **manual**: This setting prevents automatic payouts. You will have to manually\npay out the account’s balance using the [Payouts\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_payout) (acting as the connected\naccount). You also set an account to `manual` to use [Instant\nPayouts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/instant-payouts).\n- **daily**: This setting automatically pays out charges `delay_days` days after\nthey’re created. The `delay_days` value can’t be less than your own payout\nschedule or less than the default payout schedule for the account.\n- **weekly**: This setting automatically pays out the balance once a week, with\nthe day specified by the `weekly_anchor` parameter (a lower-case weekday such as\n**monday**).\n- **monthly**: This setting automatically pays out the balance once a month, as\nspecified by the `monthly_anchor` parameter (a number from 1 to 31). Payouts\nnominally scheduled between the 29th and 31st of the month are instead sent on\nthe last day of a shorter month.\n\n## Links\n\n-\n[settings.payouts.schedule](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-settings-payouts-schedule)\n- [Account](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object)\n-\n[delay_days](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-settings-payouts-schedule-delay_days)\n- [own fraud and dispute liability](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/accounts)\n- [connected accounts’\ncountry](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts#standard-payout-timing)\n- [accelerated payout\nspeeds](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts#accelerated-payout-speeds)\n- [Stripe Support](https://support.stripe.com/contact)\n- [platform\ncontrols](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/platform-controls-for-stripe-dashboard-accounts#control-payout-timing)\n- [Payouts API](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_payout)\n- [Instant Payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/instant-payouts)",
