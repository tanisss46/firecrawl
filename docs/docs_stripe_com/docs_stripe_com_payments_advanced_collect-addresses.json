You might need to\n[collect a full billing address to calculate\ntaxes](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/custom#collect-address), for example. The\n[Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element) only\ncollects the billing address details required to complete the payment, but you\ncan configure it to collect other billing details.\n\nOther reasons you might want to use the Address Element:\n\n- To collect customer [phone\nnumbers](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_address_element#address_element_create-options-fields-phone)\n- To enable\n[autocomplete](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_address_element#address_element_create-options-autocomplete)\n- To prefill billing information in the Payment Element by passing in a shipping\naddress\n\nStripe combines the collected address information and the payment method to\ncreate a [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents).\n\n## Create an Address Element\n\nWhen you create an Address Element, you specify either a `shipping` or `billing`\nmode . The [Address Element\nmode](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_address_element#address_element_create-options-mode)\ndetermines whether the shipping or billing addressed is passed to confirm the\nPaymentIntent.\n\nWhen you create an Address Element, specify whether to use it in shipping or\nbilling mode.\n\nShipping modeBilling mode\nIn shipping mode, the element does two things:\n\n- Collect a shipping address.\n- Offer the customer the option to use it as a billing address too.\n\n```\nconst stripe = Stripe('pk_test_TYooMQauvdEDq54NiTphI7jx');\n\nconst appearance = { /* appearance */ };\nconst options = { mode: 'shipping' };\nconst elements = stripe.elements({ clientSecret, appearance });\nconst addressElement = elements.create('address', options);\naddressElement.mount('#address-element');\n```\n\n### Use Address Element with other elements\n\nYou can collect both shipping and billing addresses by using multiple Address\nElements, one of each mode, on your page.\n\nIf you need to collect both shipping and billing addresses and only want to use\none Address Element, use the Address Element in Shipping mode and use the\n[Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element) to collect\nonly the necessary billing address details.\n\nWhen you use the Address Element with other elements, you can expect some\nautomatic behavior when confirming the PaymentIntent or SetupIntent. The Address\nElement validates completeness upon confirming the PaymentIntent or SetupIntent\nand then displays errors for each field if there are any validation errors.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Use the\naddress](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/address-element?platform=web#use-an-address)\n- [Set up autofill with\nLink](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/address-element?platform=web#autofill-with-link)\n- [Customize the form’s\nappearance](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/address-element?platform=web#appearance)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Address Element](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/address-element)\n- [collect a full billing address to calculate\ntaxes](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/custom#collect-address)\n- [Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element)\n- [phone\nnumbers](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_address_element#address_element_create-options-fields-phone)\n-\n[autocomplete](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_address_element#address_element_create-options-autocomplete)\n- [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents)\n- [Address Element\nmode](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_address_element#address_element_create-options-mode)\n- [View full\nsample](https://github.com/stripe-samples/accept-a-payment/tree/main/payment-element)\n- [Use the\naddress](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/address-element?platform=web#use-an-address)\n- [Set up autofill with\nLink](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/address-element?platform=web#autofill-with-link)\n- [Customize the form’s\nappearance](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/address-element?platform=web#appearance)",
