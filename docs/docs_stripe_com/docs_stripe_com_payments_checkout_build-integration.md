# Build a checkout page

Build a Stripe-hosted page, embedded form, or customize your checkout with
embedded components with [Checkout
Sessions](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions), which supports one-off
payments, subscriptions, and over 40 local payment methods.

## Payment UIs

You can use three different types of payment UIs with the Checkout Sessions API.
[Explore the options in our demo](https://checkout.stripe.dev/).

![Hosted checkout
form](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/checkout-hosted-hover.180c6ab2498a8c65daefb5bedae835bf.png)

[Stripe-hosted page](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart) Customers are
redirected to a Stripe-hosted payment page when they’re ready to complete their
purchase. After the customer enters their payment details on the payment page
and completes the transaction, they can be redirected back to your site.

API](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/checkout-embedded-hover.14466c835d9723cfe90b3549956c451a.png)

[Embedded form](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/embedded/quickstart) Customers
stay on your site and are shown an embedded form when they’re ready to complete
their purchase. The customer enters their payment details on the form and
completes the transaction on the same page in your site so they don’t need to be
redirected back to your site.
