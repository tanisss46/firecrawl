  "content": "# Reporting and reconciliation\n\n## Use Stripe to generate financial reports and perform reconciliation.\n\nLearn about the different payout types, balance transactions, and the advanced\nreporting features within the Sigma platform.\n\n## Reporting and payouts\n\nTo simplify reporting and reconciliation, use automatic\n[payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts), because they maintain the\nassociation between each transaction and the payout they’re included in.\n\nIf you’re building custom reporting using the APIs, use the [balance transaction\nendpoint](https://docs.stripe.com/api/balance_transactions/list) and the\n`payout` parameter to list all transactions included in an automatic payout. A\nbest practice is to retrieve payouts automatically and asynchronously when the\n[payout.paid](https://docs.stripe.com/api#event_types-payout.paid) or\n[payout.reconciliation_completed](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-payout.reconciliation_completed)\nevent is received by your [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/webhooks)\nhandler.\n\nThe number of balance transactions can exceed the maximum limit. In that case,\nwe recommend using the [auto pagination\nfeature](https://docs.stripe.com/api/pagination/auto) to fetch the list of all\nbalance transactions without having to manually paginate results and perform\nsubsequent requests.\n\nHere’s an example balance history API call to retrieve transactions from a\npayout:\n\n```\ncurl -G https://api.stripe.com/v1/balance_transactions \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d payout={{PAYOUT_ID}} \\\n -d limit=100\n```\n\nStripe\n\nServer\n\n`payout.paid` or `payout.reconciliation_completed` event\n\npayout.paid\n`GET /v1/balance_transactions`\n\nReturns list of transactions\n\nAn example balance history API call to retrieve transactions from a payout\nAutomatic payouts supports [Instant\nPayouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts#instant-payouts) that instantly send\nfunds to a supported debit card. You can request Instant Payouts 24/7, including\nweekends and holidays, and funds typically appear in the associated bank account\nwithin 30 minutes. See the [Instant Payout\ndocumentation](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts/instant-payouts-banks) to see if\nit is available in your region.\n\n### Manual payouts\n\nYou can use [manual\npayouts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/payouts-connected-accounts) if desired.\nHowever, Stripe does not support transaction-level reporting for the funds that\ncomprise your manual payouts because you specify the amount you want to get paid\nout.\n\nHere’s an example manual payout on your account:\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payouts \\\n -u sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2: \\\n -X \"POST\" \\\n -d \"amount\"=1000 \\\n -d \"currency\"=\"usd\"\n```\n\n## Financial Reports\n\nStripe supports many out-of-the-box\n[reports](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-reports) for financial analysis:\n\n- [Balance](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/balance): You can view and download\nsummarized and itemized balance transaction data, helping you to close books on\na daily, weekly, or monthly basis. These reports help you understand changes to\nyour Stripe balance.\n- [Reconciliation](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/payout-reconciliation): You\ncan see which transactions have already been paid out and which ones are yet to\nbe paid out using this report. The Reconciliation tab displays the same type of\ndata you see in the Balance tab but grouped in different ways to help you\nreconcile payouts.\n\nAll reports are available in the Stripe Dashboard, and with the API. You can\nprogrammatically request and download any of Stripe’s prebuilt reports using the\n[Reporting API](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/api).\n\nTo fully automate this process, follow our [four-step integration\npattern](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/api#integration-pattern), which\nincludes listening for events that tell you when new reporting data becomes\navailable and running your reports at that time.\n\nHere’s an example API call to generate a “Itemized payout reconciliation report\nfor a single payout” (aka “Settlement file”). Make this API call after you’ve\nbeen notified that new data is available:\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/reporting/report_runs \\\n -u sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2: \\\n -X \"POST\" \\\n -d \"report_type\"=\"payout_reconciliation.by_id.itemized.4\" \\\n -d \"parameters[interval_start]\"=1577865600 \\\n -d \"parameters[interval_end]\"=1580544000\n```\n\n## Balance transactions\n\n[Balance\ntransactions](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/balance-transaction-types) are the\nbuilding blocks of all activity on Stripe. These objects:\n\n- Represent everything that affected your Stripe balance (credits and debits).\n- Are automatically created by Stripe (for example, each successful\nPaymentIntent generates a separate BalanceTransaction object, as does each\npayout).\n- Are immutable (a refund is associated with a new BalanceTransaction negating\nthe original).\n- Can act as your ledger (to understand your balance at any point in time, you\ncan replay all BalanceTransactions up to that point).\n\nBalanceTransactions (`txn_***` objects) are also the basis of all of our\nreporting—in most reports, the line-level data point is a `txn_***` object.\n\n## Advanced reporting with Sigma\n\n[Sigma](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data) makes all of your business data\navailable in an interactive SQL environment in the Dashboard. You can write\nqueries that leverage its extensive schema, allowing you to create fully\ncustomized reports using information about your transactions.\n\nWith Sigma, you have the ability to export data directly to CSV, and schedule\nqueries to deliver results by email or\n[webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks). You can generate datasets for your\nbusiness intelligence tools, reconcile transactional data, and generate custom\nreports.\n\nTo [activate Sigma](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/get-started/sigma),\nnavigate to **Settings > Sigma** from the Dashboard. After you activate it, data\ntakes up to 24 hours to load and be queryable. Sigma uses standard ANSI SQL and\na broad range of reporting functions. Anyone on your account with permission to\nview reports can write and run queries.\n\n## Links\n\n- [payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts)\n- [balance transaction\nendpoint](https://docs.stripe.com/api/balance_transactions/list)\n- [payout.paid](https://docs.stripe.com/api#event_types-payout.paid)\n-\n[payout.reconciliation_completed](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-payout.reconciliation_completed)\n- [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/webhooks)\n- [auto pagination feature](https://docs.stripe.com/api/pagination/auto)\n- [Instant Payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts#instant-payouts)\n- [Instant Payout\ndocumentation](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts/instant-payouts-banks)\n- [manual payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/payouts-connected-accounts)\n- [reports](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-reports)\n- [Balance](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/balance)\n- [Reconciliation](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/payout-reconciliation)\n- [Reporting API](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/api)\n- [four-step integration\npattern](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/api#integration-pattern)\n- [Balance\ntransactions](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/balance-transaction-types)\n- [Sigma](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data)\n- [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks)\n- [activate Sigma](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/get-started/sigma)",
