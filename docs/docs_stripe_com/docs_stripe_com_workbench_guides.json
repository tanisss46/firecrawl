These guides\nhelp you understand how to accomplish common developer tasks.\n\n## View the API versions used by API requests\n\nWhen you send requests to Stripe, you can specify an API version with the\n`Stripe-Version` header. If you don’t specify an API version, Stripe uses your\naccount’s [default API\nversion](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#how-can-i-upgrade-my-api).\n\n- Open the [Overview](https://dashboard.stripe.com/workbench/overview) tab in\nWorkbench.\n- Review the **API versions** section to see requests made in the last week.\n- Your account’s default **API version** is labeled Default. Any requests made\nusing the latest API version are labeled Latest.\n\nTo view a list of versions, see the [API\nchangelog](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#api-versions)\n\n## View recent integration errors\n\nStripe automatically groups recent integration errors by error type and\nendpoint.\n\n- Open the [Errors](https://dashboard.stripe.com/workbench/errors) tab in\nWorkbench.\n- In the **Recent errors** pane, select the time period to filter errors by.\n- Click a group of errors to see the **Summary** describing the number of\noccurences, API endpoint, and request source.\n\n## View API request logs by HTTP method or status\n\nUse these steps to filter API request logs by HTTP method or status.\n\n- Open the [Logs](https://dashboard.stripe.com/workbench/logs) tab in Workbench.\n- Click **Status** to filter by **Succeeded** or **Failed** requests. (See the\n[complete list of HTTP status\ncodes](https://docs.stripe.com/error-low-level#status-codes) that Stripe will\nreturn.)\n- Click **Apply**.\n\n## View API request logs by source\n\nUse these steps to filter API request logs by source. API requests can orginate\nby either actions in the Dashboard, or by a direct API call (for example, by\nusing an SDK).\n\n- Open the [Logs](https://dashboard.stripe.com/workbench/logs) tab in Workbench.\n- Click **More filters**.\n- In **Source**, select **Dashboard** or **API** to filter requests by source.\n- Click **Apply**.\n\n## Filter by resource ID\n\nWhen you create, update, or delete a Stripe resource using Stripe APIs, Stripe\nreturns a resource ID in the response payload. For example, when you [Create a\ncustomer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/create), Stripe returns a\ncustomer ID (in the `id` field), such as `cus_ImZZa3EEvvQQQU`. Use these steps\nto filter API requests by resource ID.\n\n- Open the [Logs](https://dashboard.stripe.com/logs) tab in Workbench.\n- Enter the resource ID in the **Filter by resource** ID text field and press\n**Enter** on your keyboard.\n\n## Filter events\n\nUse these steps to view events and their event object payload.\n\n- Open the [Events](https://dashboard.stripe.com/events) tab in Workbench.\n- To filter by event, click **Event type**:- Enter an event name. For example,\n`payment_intent.created`.\n- Enter an event with the wildcard character. For example, `payment_intent.*`.\n- Click **Apply**.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Workbench](https://docs.stripe.com/workbench)\n- [default API\nversion](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#how-can-i-upgrade-my-api)\n- [Overview](https://dashboard.stripe.com/workbench/overview)\n- [API changelog](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#api-versions)\n- [Errors](https://dashboard.stripe.com/workbench/errors)\n- [Logs](https://dashboard.stripe.com/workbench/logs)\n- [complete list of HTTP status\ncodes](https://docs.stripe.com/error-low-level#status-codes)\n- [Create a customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/create)\n- [Logs](https://dashboard.stripe.com/logs)\n- [Events](https://dashboard.stripe.com/events)",
