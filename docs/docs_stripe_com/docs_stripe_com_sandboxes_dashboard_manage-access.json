You\ncan also assign a role in a sandbox different from the role the user has in\nother sandboxes, or in your live account. You must also assign a user a role in\nthe live account to assign them a role in a sandbox.\n\n## Manage API keys\n\nStripe uses the API keys associated with a sandbox to authenticate API requests\nmade to the applicable sandbox environment. We raise an [invalid request\nerror](https://docs.stripe.com/error-handling#invalid-request-errors) if you\ndon’t include a key and an [authentication\nerror](https://docs.stripe.com/error-handling#authentication-errors) if the key\nis incorrect or outdated.\n\nUse the [Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys) within\nthe sandbox to reveal, revoke, and create API keys.
