You can get started\nquickly and programmatically control every detail of your program, from card\ndesign to approving transactions in real time. Many users build Stripe Issuing\nin conjunction with [Stripe Treasury](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury) to\nattach cards to open loop wallets to offer their users additional money movement\nfunctionalities.\n\n[Contact sales](https://stripe.com/contact/sales) to start the process and\ndetermine your eligibility to use Issuing. If you’re interested in using\nTreasury with your Issuing integration, fill out the [Treasury\nform](https://go.stripe.global/treasury-inquiry) instead.\n\nIssuing is currently available in the US, UK, and many [European Economic\nArea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Area) (EEA) countries. In\nthe US, you can provide cards to individuals who reside in the same country\nwhere business is established. If your business is established in the EU or the\nUK, you can provide cards to individuals residing in EEA countries and the UK.\nRead more about [global issuing](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/global) and see\na full list of supported countries.\n\nA common use case for Issuing is spend management, which enables customers to\nstore funds on your platform and manage spending with branded cards.\n\n## Building blocks for financial offerings\n\nStripe Issuing provides the tools and components needed to build a full-featured\nfinancial offering for your customers.\n\nCreating accountsIssuing CardsControlling SpendFunding with an Issuing\nBalanceUsing Issuing with Treasury- [Identity\nverification](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/identity-verification)- Reduce\nrisk\n- Perform KYC checks\n- Run sanctions screening\n\nWe’ve partnered with multiple trusted banks to provide the banking-as-a-service\ninfrastructure for you to build new financial service offerings.\n\nWe also partner with both Mastercard and Visa card networks so you can choose\nthe network on which you want to issue cards. You can also issue cards on both\nnetworks.\n\n## Issuing architecture\n\nWith Stripe [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect), you onboard customers to\nyour platform with connected accounts. For each of these connected accounts, you\ncan create accountholders and provide cards to authorized users.

Learn how to\n[create connected\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/design-an-integration?connect-onboarding-surface=api&connect-dashboard-type=none&connect-economic-model=buy-rate&connect-loss-liability-owner=platform&connect-charge-type=direct)\nthat work with Issuing.\n\n### Issuing balance\n\nAn Issuing balance is a funding source attached to a connected account that\nprovides the funds for spending with the associated card account. Funds can be\nadded to the connected account’s Issuing balance either by transferring from the\nconnected account’s Stripe account balance, or through a top up from an external\nbank account. Funds can also be paid out from the Issuing balance to an external\nbank account.\n\nConnected accounts can also use a Stripe Treasury account to fund cards for a\nfull banking-as-a-service solution.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Learn how to set up Issuing as a Connect\nplatform](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/connect)\n- [Review compliance requirements pertaining to\nIssuing](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/compliance-us)\n- [Review best practices and tools for testing an Issuing\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/testing)\n- [Learn about setting card rules to control\nspending](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/controls/spending-controls)\n- [Learn about fraud controls and tools offered through Stripe\nIssuing](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/manage-fraud)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Stripe Issuing](https://stripe.com/issuing)\n- [Stripe Treasury](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury)\n- [Contact sales](https://stripe.com/contact/sales)\n- [Treasury form](https://go.stripe.global/treasury-inquiry)\n- [European Economic Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Area)\n- [global issuing](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/global)\n- [Identity verification](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/identity-verification)\n- [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)\n- [create connected\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/design-an-integration?connect-onboarding-surface=api&connect-dashboard-type=none&connect-economic-model=buy-rate&connect-loss-liability-owner=platform&connect-charge-type=direct)\n- [Learn how to set up Issuing as a Connect\nplatform](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/connect)\n- [Review compliance requirements pertaining to\nIssuing](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/compliance-us)\n- [Review best practices and tools for testing an Issuing\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/testing)\n- [Learn about setting card rules to control\nspending](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/controls/spending-controls)\n- [Learn about fraud controls and tools offered through Stripe\nIssuing](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/manage-fraud)",
