  "content": "# Balance transaction types\n\n## Learn more about the different types of balance transactions that represent funds moving through your Stripe account.\n\nBalance transactions are our recommended starting point for reporting on your\naccount’s balance activity. We create them for every type of transaction that\ncomes into, or flows out of, your Stripe account’s balance.\n\nYou can create reports that make use of balance transactions using the\n[API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/) or\n[Sigma](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data/query-transactions).\n\nWhen you first receive a payment in your account, we initially reflect it as a\n`pending` balance (less any Stripe fees). This balance becomes `available`\naccording to your payout schedule. The\n[status](https://docs.stripe.com/api#balance_transaction_object-status)\nattribute on balance transactions indicates the type of the balance.\n\nTo classify transactions for [accounting\npurposes](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/reporting-categories), use the\n`reporting_category` field instead of the `type` field.\n\n## Balance transaction source\n\nBalance transactions include a\n[source](https://docs.stripe.com/api#balance_transaction_object-source) field\nthat contains the ID of the related Stripe object.\n\nUse the [API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/) to retrieve additional information\nabout the payment activity that caused the creation of the Balance transaction.\nUsing [Sigma](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data/query-transactions), you can\nalso join the `balance_transactions` table with other tables using the\n`source_id` column.\n\n## Balance transaction types\n\nYou can organize balance transaction types into different groups based on the\nunderlying activity that generated the balance transactions.\n\nIf you’re not using the Connect API or Issuing API, your balance transactions\nbelong in the first two groups (“related to charges and payments” or “related to\nStripe balance changes”).\n\n### Balance transaction types related to charges and payments\n\nThese balance transaction types are related to creating and refunding charges as\npart of processing payments.\n\nTypeDescriptioncharge\nCreated when a [credit card\ncharge](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment-charges) is created\nsuccessfully.\n\npayment\nCreated when a [local payment\nmethod](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/overview) charge is\ncreated successfully.\n\npayment_failure_refund\n[ACH, direct debit](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/overview),\nand other [delayed notification payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#payment-notification)\nremain in a pending state until they either succeed or fail. You’ll see a\npending Balance transaction of type `payment` when the payment is created.\nAnother Balance transaction of type `payment_failure_refund` appears if the\npending payment later fails.\n\npayment_refund\nCreated when a [local payment\nmethod](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/overview) refund is\ninitiated.\n\nAdditionally, if your customer’s bank or card issuer is unable to correctly\nprocess a refund (e.g., due to a closed bank account or a problem with the card)\nStripe returns the funds to your balance. The returned funds are represented as\na Balance transaction with the type `payment_refund`.\n\npayment_reversal\nCreated when a debit/failure related to a payment is detected from a banking\npartner. This balance transaction takes funds that were previously credited to\nthe merchant for a payment out of the merchant balance.\n\nrefund\nCreated when a [credit card charge refund](https://docs.stripe.com/refunds) is\ninitiated.\n\nIf you [authorize and\ncapture](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/place-a-hold-on-a-payment-method)\nseparately and the capture amount is less than the initial authorization, you\nsee a balance transaction of type `charge` for the full authorization amount and\nanother balance transaction of type `refund` for the uncaptured portion.\n\nrefund_failure\nCreated when a [credit card charge refund](https://docs.stripe.com/refunds)\nfails, and Stripe returns the funds to your balance.\n\nThis may occur if your customer’s bank or card issuer is unable to correctly\nprocess a refund (e.g., due to a closed bank account or a problem with the\ncard).\n\n### Balance transaction types related to Stripe balance changes\n\nThese balance transaction types are related to changes that affect your Stripe\nbalance such as payouts, fees and top-ups.\n\nTypeDescriptionadjustment\nAdjustments correspond to additions or deductions from your Stripe balance that\nare made outside of the normal charge/refund flow. For example, some of the most\ncommon reasons for adjustments are:\n\n- **Refund failures**. If your customer’s bank or card issuer is unable to\ncorrectly process a refund (e.g., due to a closed bank account or a problem with\nthe card) Stripe returns the funds to your balance. The returned funds are\nrepresented as a Balance transaction with the type `adjustment`, where the\ndescription indicates the related refund object.\n- **Disputes**. When a customer [disputes a\ncharge](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes), Stripe deducts the disputed amount\nfrom your balance. The deduction is represented as a Balance transaction with\nthe type `adjustment`, where the source object is a dispute.\n- **Dispute reversals**. When you [win a\ndispute](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes#responding-to-a-dispute), the disputed\namount is returned to your balance. The returned funds are represented as a\nBalance transaction with the type `adjustment`, where the source object is a\ndispute.\n- In the past, fees for Stripe software and services (e.g., for Radar, Connect\nand Billing) were represented as adjustments.\n- In the past, Connect platform fee refunds were represented as adjustments.\n\nThe `description` field on the Balance transaction describes the purpose of each\nadjustment.\n\nadvance\nIncrementing funds as part of an advance operation to change the date that funds\nsettle to your balance. For example, this can occur when you create an [instant\npayout](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts/instant-payouts-with-advance-funding)\nand the requested payout amount is greater than your available balance. Funds\nare credited to a new `available_on` date and debited from the original\n`available_on` date to cover the difference.\n\nadvance_funding\nDecrementing funds as part of an advance operation to change the date that funds\nsettle to your balance. For example, this can occur when you create an [instant\npayout](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts/instant-payouts-with-advance-funding)\nand the requested payout amount is greater than your available balance. Funds\nare credited to a new `available_on` date and debited from the original\n`available_on` date to cover the difference.\n\nanticipation_repayment\nRepayments made to service an anticipation loan in Brazil. These repayments go\nto the financial institution to whom you have sold your receivables.\n\nbalance_transfer_inbound\nFunds moving into a balance (e.g. Issuing balance) from another balance (e.g.\nStripe balance)\n\nbalance_transfer_outbound\nFunds moving from your Stripe balance to a different (e.g. Issuing) balance.\n\nclimate_order_purchase\nFunds used to purchase carbon removal units from Frontier Climate.\n\nclimate_order_refund\nFunds refunded to your balance when a Climate Order is canceled.\n\ncontribution\nFunds contributed via Stripe to a cause (currently Stripe Climate).\n\nobligation_outbound\nObligation for receivable unit received.\n\nobligation_reversal_inbound\nObligation for receivable unit reversed.\n\npayment_network_reserve_hold\nFunds that a payment network holds in reserve (e.g. to mitigate risk).\n\npayment_network_reserve_release\nFunds that a payment network releases from a reserve.\n\npayment_unreconciled\nCreated when a customer has unreconciled funds within Stripe for more than\nninety days. This balance transaction transfers those funds to your balance.\n\npayout\n[Payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts) from your Stripe balance to your bank\naccount.\n\npayout_cancel\nCreated when a payout to your bank account is cancelled and the funds are\nreturned to your Stripe balance.\n\npayout_failure\nCreated when a [payout to your bank account\nfails](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts#payout-failures) and the funds are\nreturned to your Stripe balance.\n\npayout_minimum_balance_hold\nMinimum balance held from a payout.\n\npayout_minimum_balance_release\nMinimum balance released after a payout.\n\nreserved_funds\nWhen Stripe holds your funds in reserve to mitigate risk, two balance\ntransactions are created: one to debit the funds from your balance, and a second\nto credit the funds back to your balance at the end of the reserve period.\n\nstripe_fee\nFees for Stripe software and services (e.g., for\n[Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar),\n[Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect),\n[Billing](https://docs.stripe.com/billing), and\n[Identity](https://docs.stripe.com/identity)).\n\nstripe_fx_fee\nStripe currency conversion fee\n\ntax_fee\nTaxes collected by Stripe to be remitted to the appropriate local governments.\nTypically, this is a tax on Stripe fees.\n\ntopup\nFunds you transferred into your Stripe balance from your bank account. [Learn\nmore](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/top-ups).\n\ntopup_reversal\nIf an initially successful top-up fails or is cancelled, the credit to your\nStripe balance is reversed. [Learn\nmore](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/top-ups).\n\n### Balance transaction types related to Issuing\n\nThese balance transaction types are created as part of using the [Issuing\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing).\n\nTypeDescriptionissuing_authorization_hold\nWhen [an issued card](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing) is used to make a\npurchase, an\n[authorization](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/purchases/authorizations) is\ncreated. If the authorization is approved, a balance transaction is created with\nthe type `issuing_authorization_hold` to hold the authorized amount in reserve\nfrom your account balance, until the authorization is either captured or voided.\nSome merchants can also update an authorization to request an additional amount\n(e.g., to extend a hotel booking or add a tip), and this is also represented as\na balance transaction with the type `issuing_authorization_hold`.\n\nissuing_authorization_release\nWhen an authorized purchase, made with [an issued\ncard](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing), is captured by the merchant, the funds\npreviously held for the authorization (`issuing_authorization_hold`) are\nreleased with a `issuing_authorization_release` balance transaction.\nSimultaneously, [an issuing\ntransaction](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/transactions) is created, and the\npurchase amount is deducted from your Stripe balance in another balance\ntransaction with the type `issuing_transaction`.\n\nissuing_dispute\nWhen you dispute an [Issuing\ntransaction](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/transactions) and funds return to\nyour Stripe balance.\n\nissuing_transaction\nWhen an authorized purchase, made with an [issued\ncard](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing), has been authorized and captured by the\nmerchant, [an issuing transaction](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/transactions)\nis created, and the purchase amount is deducted from your Stripe balance with a\n`issuing_transaction` balance transaction.\n\n### Balance transaction types related to Connect\n\nThese balance transaction types are related to using the [Connect\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/connect) and related APIs, such as [instant\npayouts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/instant-payouts).\n\nTypeDescriptionapplication_fee\nEarnings you’ve generated by collecting [platform\nfees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees) via [Stripe\nConnect charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges).\n\napplication_fee_refund\n[Platform fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\nthat you have returned to your connected accounts.\n\nconnect_collection_transfer\nIf one of your connected accounts has a negative balance for 180 days, Stripe\ntransfers a portion of your balance, to zero out that account’s balance. [Learn\nmore](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-balances#understanding-connected-reserve-balances).\n\nreserve_transaction\nIf one of your connected accounts’ balances becomes negative, Stripe temporarily\nreserves a portion of your balance to ensure that funds can be covered.\n\nIf one of your connected accounts’ previously negative balance becomes less\nnegative due to activity on account, another `reserve_transaction` is created to\nrelease a corresponding portion of the funds held in reserve. [Learn\nmore](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-balances#understanding-connected-reserve-balances).\n\ntransfer\nFunds sent from your balance to the balance of your [connected\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers).\n\ntransfer_cancel\nTransfers to your connected accounts that have been cancelled.\n\ntransfer_failure\nTransfers to your connected accounts that failed. Transfer failures add to your\nplatform’s balance and subtract from the connected account’s balance.\n\ntransfer_refund\nTransfers to your connected accounts that you\n[reversed](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers#reversing-transfers)\nor that were reversed as a result of a failure in\n[payments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/overview) made\nthrough ACH, direct debit, and other [delayed notification payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#payment-notification).\nTransfer reversals add to your platform’s balance and subtract from the\nconnected account’s balance.\n\n## Links\n\n- [API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/)\n- [Sigma](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data/query-transactions)\n- [status](https://docs.stripe.com/api#balance_transaction_object-status)\n- [accounting purposes](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/reporting-categories)\n- [source](https://docs.stripe.com/api#balance_transaction_object-source)\n- [credit card\ncharge](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment-charges)\n- [local payment\nmethod](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/overview)\n- [delayed notification payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#payment-notification)\n- [credit card charge refund](https://docs.stripe.com/refunds)\n- [authorize and\ncapture](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/place-a-hold-on-a-payment-method)\n- [disputes a charge](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes)\n- [win a dispute](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes#responding-to-a-dispute)\n- [instant\npayout](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts/instant-payouts-with-advance-funding)\n- [Payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts)\n- [payout to your bank account\nfails](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts#payout-failures)\n- [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar)\n- [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)\n- [Billing](https://docs.stripe.com/billing)\n- [Identity](https://docs.stripe.com/identity)\n- [Learn more](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/top-ups)\n- [Issuing API](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing)\n- [authorization](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/purchases/authorizations)\n- [an issuing transaction](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/transactions)\n- [instant payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/instant-payouts)\n- [platform fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\n- [Stripe Connect charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges)\n- [Learn\nmore](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-balances#understanding-connected-reserve-balances)\n- [connected\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n-\n[reversed](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers#reversing-transfers)",
