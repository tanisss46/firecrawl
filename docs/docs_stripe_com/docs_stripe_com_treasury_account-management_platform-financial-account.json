  "content": "# Platform financial accounts\n\n## Learn about the financial account for your platform.\n\nAfter you’ve [gained API access](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/access) to\nStripe Treasury, we automatically provision your platform with two financial\naccounts, one for test mode and one for live mode.\n\nThe test mode platform financial account enables you to set up and test your\nintegration without actually affecting either your platform account balance or\nthe balance of your live mode platform financial account.\n\nThe live mode platform financial account is where you store your own funds as\nworking capital for your Treasury program. The live mode platform financial\naccount has its own routing number and account number and supports most of the\nsame types of money movement as the financial accounts attached to your\nplatform’s connected accounts.\n\n## Platform financial account differences\n\nThe financial accounts (live mode and test mode) for your platform are\nessentially the same as the financial accounts attached to your platform’s\nconnected accounts. You use the same API requests regardless of which financial\naccount is involved; however, you don’t include a [Stripe-Account\nheader](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/authentication#stripe-account-header)\nwhen making API calls against your platform financial account. The\n`Stripe-Account` header signals that a request is for the associated connected\naccount’s financial account rather than your platform’s.\n\nThe following list itemizes the differences between platform financial accounts\nand financial accounts attached to connected accounts:\n\n- You can’t attach Stripe Issuing cards to platform financial accounts.- You can\nattach Stripe Issuing cards to the financial accounts attached to connected\naccounts.\n- You can’t transfer funds from your platform financial account balance directly\nto the account balance of a connected account.- You can transfer funds from your\nplatform financial account balance directly to the balance of a financial\naccount attached to a connected account.\n- You must use the Stripe Dashboard (rather than the API) to set the platform\nfinancial account as a `BankAccount` object that you can use for payouts from or\ntop-ups to the platform payments balance.- See the [Payouts and\ntop-ups](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/payouts#financial-accounts-as-external-accounts)\nguide for more information.\n- You can’t accelerate payouts from the platform account balance to the platform\nfinancial account balance.\n\n## Retrieving platform financial account details\n\nYou can find your platform financial account routing number, account number, and\nbalance in the **Treasury balance** section under the **Balances** tab of your\nStripe [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/treasury). Use the API to\nview the other details of your platform financial account.\n\n![Treasury balance section of the Dashboard showing account number, routing\nnumber, and total amount of\nbalance.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/treasury-balance.1647f7e2fdd3492e4bdab81cfced4b8b.png)\n\nTreasury balance\n\nUse `GET /v1/treasury/financial_accounts` to list all the details of your\nplatform financial accounts through the API. A `Stripe-Account` header isn’t\nincluded, signaling this request is for the platform financial account.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/treasury/financial_accounts \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\"\n```\n\nIf successful, the response includes your platform financial account `id`. You\ncan use the financial account ID to directly retrieve your platform financial\naccount details using `GET\n/v1/treasury/financial_accounts/{{FINANCIALACCOUNT_ID}}`.\n\n```\ncurl\nhttps://api.stripe.com/v1/treasury/financial_accounts/{{FINANCIAL_ACCOUNT_ID}} \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\"\n```\n\nThe `FinancialAccount` object displays the data that defines your financial\naccount, including your balance and the balance of any pending transactions.\n\n```\n{\n \"object\": \"treasury.financial_account\",\n \"created\": 1612927106,\n \"id\": \"fa_123\",\n \"country\": \"US\",\n \"supported_currencies\": [\"usd\"],\n// Arrays of active, pending and restricted features summarize the status of all\nrequested features\n \"active_features\": [\"financial_addresses.aba\", \"deposit_insurance\"],\n \"pending_features\": [\"inbound_transfers.ach\"],\n\"restricted_features\": [\"intra_stripe_flows\", \"outbound_payments.ach\",\n\"outbound_payments.us_domestic_wire\"],\n```\n\nSee all 48 lines\n## Create additional financial accounts for your platform\n\nYou can create up to 3 financial accounts on your platform account. Use `POST\n/v1/treasury/financial_accounts` without a `Stripe-Account` header to create a\nnew financial account.\n\n## Platform default financial account\n\nYour platform has one financial account that is the default financial account.\nThat financial account is used by Stripe to service your platform. For example,\na default financial account is used by Stripe to remediate negative balances\nincurred by connected accounts.\n\nBy default, your default financial account is the first financial account\ncreated on your platform account. Your default financial account is denoted by\nthe `is_default` field set to `true` on the financial account.\n\n## Retrieving platform financial account features\n\nUse `GET /v1/treasury/financial_accounts/{{FINANCIALACCOUNT_ID}}/features` to\nretrieve your platform’s financial account feature information.\n\n```\ncurl\nhttps://api.stripe.com/v1/treasury/financial_accounts/{{FINANCIAL_ACCOUNT_ID}}/features\n\\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\"\n```\n\nIf successful, the response itemizes the features assigned to your platform\nfinancial account.\n\n```\n{\n \"object\": \"treasury.financial_account_features\",\n \"card_issuing\": {\n \"requested\": true,\n \"status\": \"active\",\n \"status_details\": []\n },\n \"deposit_insurance\": {\n \"requested\": true,\n \"status\": \"active\",\n```\n\nSee all 44 lines\n## Moving money between the Treasury financial accounts of the platform and its connected accounts\n\nUse `OutboundPayments` over the `stripe` network to instantly move funds between\na platform Treasury financial account and the Treasury financial accounts of\nconnected accounts associated with the same platform.
