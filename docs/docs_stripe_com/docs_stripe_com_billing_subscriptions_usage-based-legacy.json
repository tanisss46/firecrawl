See the [updated usage-based\nbilling docs](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based).\n\nLearn how to\n[migrate](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based-legacy/migration-guide).\n\n## Getting started\n\n[Usage-based pricing modelLearn how to model usage-based pricing on\nStripe.](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based-legacy/pricing-models)[Record\nusageRecord the usage of your users and report it to\nStripe.](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based-legacy/recording-usage)[Usage-based\nbilling overviewUnderstand the major pieces of a usage-based billing\nintegration.](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based-legacy#sample-integration)\n## Usage-based billing lifecycle\n\nHere’s what the lifecycle of a usage-based billing looks like.\n\nThis diagram illustrates what happens after you’ve implemented a customer\nexperience.\n\nCustomer\n\nTypographic\n\nStripe\n\nSelect plan\n\nCreate subscription with `payment_behavior` set to\n[default_incomplete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/create#create_subscription-payment_behavior)\n\nReturn subscription object\n\nPresent new subscription\n\nProvision access\n\nNotify customer that they have access\n\nUse service\n\nCreate [usage records](https://docs.stripe.com/api/usage_records)\n\nReport usage to Stripe\n\nSend invoice for amount of service used\n\nUsage-based billing\n## Sample integration\n\nThis example walks through the implementation of a fictional font service called\nTypographic.\n\n## Create a product and pricing\n\nModel your business on stripe with products and prices.\n\nCreate your [products](https://docs.stripe.com/api/products) and their pricing\noptions with the Stripe API or Dashboard. Typographic has three products, each\nwith two tiers:\n\n- Standard- Tier one: 10 USD per month for 10,000 requests\n- Tier two: An additional $0.10 USD for each request after 10,000\n- Growth- Tier one: 25 USD per month for 10,000 requests\n- Tier two: An additional $0.10 USD for each request after 10,000\n- Enterprise- Tier one: 75 USD per month for 10,000 requests\n- Tier two: An additional $0.0075 USD for each request after 10,000\n\nTo achieve this kind of pricing, you charge a flat fee and an additional amount\nbased on how much customers use. With [graduated\ntiers](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models#graduated-pricing),\ncustomers initially pay the flat fee for the first 10,000 requests. If they make\nmore requests than that, they reach tier two and start paying for each\nadditional request. You could also charge solely based on usage without the flat\nfee.\n\nDuring each billing period, you create [usage\nrecords](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based-legacy/recording-usage)\nfor each customer and then Stripe adds them up to determine how much to bill\nfor. This process is explained in a subsequent step but understanding the\ndefault behavior might impact how you create prices.\n\nDashboardAPI\nTo create a metered usage pricing model on Stripe through the Dashboard:\n\nFirst, create the `Standard` product. To learn about all the options for\ncreating a product, see the [prices\nguide](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/manage-prices#create-product).\n\n- Go to the **Products** [tab](https://dashboard.stripe.com/products).\n- Click **+ Add product**.\n- Enter the **Name** of the product: `Standard`, in this case.\n- *(Optional)* Add a **Description**. The description appears at checkout, on\nthe [customer portal](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management), and in\n[quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/quotes).\n\nNext, create the monthly price for the `Standard` product. Select **Graduated\npricing** for the **Pricing model**, then select **Recurring**.\n\nCreate two graduated pricing tiers:\n\nFirst unitLast unitPer unitFlat feeFor the first010,0000.00 USD10.00 USDFor the\nnext10,001∞0.10 USD0.00 USD\nThen, select **Monthly** for the **Billing period** and check **Usage is\nmetered**.\n\nRepeat the steps for the `Growth` and `Enterprise` products, filling in the\nappropriate values as necessary.\n\nRead the docs to learn more about different [pricing\nmodels](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models).\n\n## Sign up customers\n\nTo let your customers sign up for your services, you need to present a payment\nform on your website. Use [Stripe\nCheckout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart) to embed the form on your\nsite or redirect customers to a Stripe-hosted form. When a customer selects a\nrecurring product and enters their billing information in the Payment Link,\nStripe creates two records:\n\n- [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object)\n- [Subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object) These records\nare both stored within Stripe.\n\nStripe offers other options for setting up your payment form:\n\n- [Pricing tables](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/pricing-table):\nCreate a pricing table from the Stripe Dashboard and embed it on your site. When\na customer selects a plan, they’re taken to your checkout page. Pricing tables\ndon’t support sub-cent pricing.\n- [Web Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements): Build custom\ncheckout flows to integrate with your site.\n\n## Create a usage record\n\nThroughout each billing period, you need to report usage to Stripe so that\ncustomers are billed the correct amounts. You can maintain your own system for\nrecording customer usage and provide usage information for subscriptions to\nStripe.\n\nLearn how to [record and report\nusage](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based-legacy/recording-usage).\n\n## Test your integration\n\nTest your integration to make sure it behaves as you expect. Learn more about\n[testing subscriptions integrations](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/testing).\n\nYou can use test clocks to test different scenarios, including mock usage\nrecords. When you make a usage reporting call, you need to sync the timestamp of\nthe test clock with the usage records. Make a note of the test clock timestamp\nso that your usage records fall within the same time window. Learn more about\n[test clocks](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/testing/test-clocks).\n\n[OptionalFree\ntrials](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based-legacy#trials)[OptionalCancellations](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based-legacy#cancellations)[OptionalBilling\nthresholds](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based-legacy#thresholds)[OptionalAggregate\nmetered\nusage](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based-legacy#aggregate-metered-usage)[OptionalTransforming\nquantities](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based-legacy#transforming-quantities)\n## See also\n\n- [Sample implementation\nrepository](https://github.com/stripe-samples/subscription-use-cases/tree/main/usage-based-subscriptions)\n- [Usage-based billing video\ntutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8cN4pEofy8)\n\n## Links\n\n- [updated usage-based billing\ndocs](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based)\n-\n[migrate](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based-legacy/migration-guide)\n- [Usage-based pricing modelLearn how to model usage-based pricing on\nStripe.](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based-legacy/pricing-models)\n- [Record usageRecord the usage of your users and report it to\nStripe.](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based-legacy/recording-usage)\n- [Usage-based billing overviewUnderstand the major pieces of a usage-based\nbilling\nintegration.](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based-legacy#sample-integration)\n-\n[default_incomplete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/create#create_subscription-payment_behavior)\n- [usage records](https://docs.stripe.com/api/usage_records)\n- [products](https://docs.stripe.com/api/products)\n- [graduated\ntiers](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models#graduated-pricing)\n- [prices\nguide](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/manage-prices#create-product)\n- [tab](https://dashboard.stripe.com/products)\n- [customer portal](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management)\n- [quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/quotes)\n- [pricing models](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models)\n- [Stripe Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart)\n- [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object)\n- [Subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object)\n- [Pricing tables](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/pricing-table)\n- [Web Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements)\n- [testing subscriptions integrations](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/testing)\n- [test clocks](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/testing/test-clocks)\n- [Sample implementation\nrepository](https://github.com/stripe-samples/subscription-use-cases/tree/main/usage-based-subscriptions)\n- [Usage-based billing video\ntutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8cN4pEofy8)",
