# Sample apps

## See working apps from design to code.

Many sample apps are available [on
GitHub](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-apps/tree/main/examples) or as design
files [in our Figma UI
toolkit](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1105918844720321397). Use these as
a starting point for your own app.

## Complete sample app

SuperTodo is a complete to-do list app you can [download from
GitHub](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-apps/tree/main/examples/super-todo). It
demonstrates:

- A [frontend-only
app](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/how-stripe-apps-work#frontend-only-applications)
that integrates with the Stripe API
- UI components, including
[List](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/components/list),
[Tab](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/components/tabs), and
[Button](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/components/button)
- Design patterns, including [Action
buttons](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/patterns/action-buttons) and
[Communicating
state](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/patterns/communicating-state)

app](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/supertodo.2647da490dc734af24defeb13356d902.png)

The SuperTodo example app shows you how to use lists, tabs, buttons, a creation
screen, and a confirmation message

## Sample design files

Our [Figma UI toolkit](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1105918844720321397)
includes design examples for SuperTodo and five other sample apps. Use these to
see our [design patterns](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/patterns) and [UI
components](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/components) in action.
