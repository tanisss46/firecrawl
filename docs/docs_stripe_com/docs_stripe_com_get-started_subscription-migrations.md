# Migrate your subscriptions to Stripe

## Successfully migrate your existing subscriptions to Stripe

You can import existing
[subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating) from
third-party billing systems (such as Zuora, Recurly, Chargify, or Chargebee)
into Stripe Billing. You can also migrate subscriptions from an in-house billing
system or from a different Stripe account.

To begin migration, see [Migrate subscriptions to Stripe
