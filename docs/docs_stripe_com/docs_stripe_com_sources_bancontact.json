  "content": "# Bancontact payments with Sources\n\n## Use Sources to accept payments using Bancontact, Belgium's most popular payment method.\n\n#### Warning\n\nWe deprecated the Sources API and plan to remove support for local payment\nmethods. If you currently integrate with Bancontact using the Sources API, you\nmust [migrate to the Payment Methods\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/transitioning).\n\nFor information about integrating Bancontact with the current APIs, see\n[Bancontact payments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bancontact).\n\nStripe users in Europe and the United States can accept\n[Bancontact](https://www.bancontact.com/) payments from customers in Belgium\nusing [Sources](https://docs.stripe.com/sources).\n\nDuring the payment process, a [Source](https://docs.stripe.com/api#sources)\nobject is created and your customer is redirected to their bank’s website or\nmobile application to authorize the payment. After completing this, your\nintegration uses the source to make a charge request and complete the payment.\n\nBancontact is a\n[push](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#pull-or-push-of-funds)-based,\n[single-use](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#single-use-or-reusable) and\n[synchronous](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#synchronous-or-asynchronous-confirmation)\nmethod of payment. This means your customer takes action to send the amount to\nyou through a\n[redirect](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#flow-for-customer-action) and there\nis immediate confirmation about the success or failure of a payment.\n\n[Create a Source\nobject](https://docs.stripe.com/sources/bancontact#create-source)\nA `Source` object is either created client-side using\n[Stripe.js](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements) or server-side using the\n[Source creation endpoint](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_source), with the\nfollowing parameters:\n\nParameterValue`type`bancontact`amount`A positive integer in the [smallest\ncurrency unit](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#zero-decimal) representing the\namount to charge the customer (for example, 1099 for a 10.99 EUR payment). The\ncharge amount must be at least 1 EUR or its equivalent in the given\ncurrency.`bancontact[preferred_language]` (optional)The preferred language of\nthe Bancontact authorization page that the customer is redirected to. Supported\nvalues are: en, de, fr, or nl.`currency`eur (Bancontact must always use\nEuros)`owner[name]`The full name of the account holder.`redirect[return_url]`The\nURL the customer should be redirected to after the authorization\nprocess.`statement_descriptor` (optional)A custom statement descriptor for the\npayment.\nTo create a source with [Stripe.js](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements),\nfirst include the library within your website and set your [publishable API\nkey](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys). Once included, use the following\n`createSource` method to create a source client-side:\n\n```\nstripe.createSource({\n type: 'bancontact',\n amount: 1099,\n currency: 'eur',\n owner: {\n name: 'Jenny Rosen',\n },\n redirect: {\n return_url: '__TOKEN_PLACEHOLDER_0__',\n },\n}).then(function(result) {\n // handle result.error or result.source\n});\n```\n\nUsing either method, Stripe returns a `Source` object containing the relevant\ndetails for the method of payment used. Information specific to Bancontact is\nprovided within the `bancontact` subhash.\n\n```\n{\n \"id\": \"src_16xhynE8WzK49JbAs9M21jaR\",\n \"object\": \"source\",\n \"amount\": 1099,\n \"client_secret\": \"src_client_secret_UfwvW2WHpZ0s3QEn9g5x7waU\",\n \"created\": 1445277809,\n \"currency\": \"eur\",\n \"statement_descriptor\": null,\n \"flow\": \"redirect\",\n \"livemode\": true,\n```\n\nSee all 37 lines\n### Source creation in mobile applications\n\nIf you’re building an iOS or Android app, you can implement sources using our\nmobile SDKs. Refer to our sources documentation for\n[iOS](https://docs.stripe.com/mobile/ios/sources) or\n[Android](https://docs.stripe.com/mobile/android/sources) to learn more.\n\n### Optional: Providing a custom statement descriptor\n\nBancontact requires a [statement\ndescriptor](https://support.stripe.com/questions/when-i-charge-a-customer-what-will-they-see-on-their-card-statements)\nbefore the customer is redirected to authenticate the payment. By default, your\nStripe account’s statement descriptor is used (you can review this in the\n[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public)). You can provide a\ncustom descriptor by specifying `statement_descriptor` when creating a source.\nBancontact statement descriptors support a maximum of 35 characters.\n\n```\nstripe.createSource({\n type: 'bancontact',\n amount: 1099,\n currency: 'eur',\n statement_descriptor: 'ORDER AT11990',\n owner: {\n name: 'Jenny Rosen',\n },\n redirect: {\n return_url: '__TOKEN_PLACEHOLDER_0__',\n },\n}).then(function(result) {\n // handle result.error or result.source\n});\n```\n\nProviding a custom statement descriptor within a subsequent charge request has\nno effect.\n\n### Error codes\n\nSource creation for Bancontact payments may return any of the following errors:\n\nErrorDescription`payment_method_not_available`The payment method is currently\nnot available. You should invite your customer to fallback to another payment\nmethod to proceed.`processing_error`An unexpected error occurred preventing us\nfrom creating the source. The source creation should be\nretried.`invalid_owner_name`The owner name is invalid. It must be at least three\ncharacters in length.[Have the customer authorize the\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/sources/bancontact#customer-action)\nWhen creating a source, its status is initially set to `pending` and cannot yet\nbe used to make a charge request. Your customer must authorize a Bancontact\npayment to make the source chargeable. To allow your customer to authorize the\npayment, redirect them to the URL provided within the`redirect[url]` attribute\nof the `Source` object.\n\nAfter the authorization process, your customer is redirected back to the URL\nprovided as a value of `redirect[return_url]`. This happens regardless of\nwhether authorization was successful or not. If the customer has authorized the\npayment, the `Source` object’s status is updated to `chargeable` and it is ready\nto use in a charge request. If your customer declines the payment, the status\ntransitions to `failed`.\n\nStripe populates the `redirect[return_url]` with the following GET parameters\nwhen returning your customer to your website:\n\n- `source`: a string representing the original ID of the `Source` object\n- `livemode`: indicates if this is a live payment, either `true` or `false`\n- `client_secret`: used to confirm that the returning customer is the same one\nwho triggered the creation of the source (source IDs are not considered secret)\n\nYou may include any other GET parameters you may need when specifying\n`redirect[return_url]`. Do not use the above as parameter names yourself as\nthese would be overridden with the values we populate.\n\n### Mobile applications\n\nTo integrate Bancontact within a mobile application, provide your application\nURI scheme as the `redirect[return_url]` value. By doing so, your customers are\nreturned to your app after completing authorization. Refer to our Sources\ndocumentation for [iOS](https://docs.stripe.com/mobile/ios/sources) or\n[Android](https://docs.stripe.com/mobile/android/sources) to learn more.\n\nIf you are integrating without using our mobile SDKs, the redirect URL must be\nopened using the device’s native browser. The use of in-app web views and\ncontainers can prevent your customer from completing authentication—resulting in\na lower conversion rate.\n\n### Testing the redirect process\n\nWhen creating a `Source` object using your test API keys, you can follow the URL\nreturned in the `redirect[url]` field. This leads to a Stripe page that displays\ninformation about the API request, and where you can either authorize or cancel\nthe payment. Authorizing the payment redirects you to the URL specified in\n`redirect[return_url]`.\n\nAlternatively, to accelerate testing, use the following value for\n`owner[email]`, where `xxx_` is any prefix of your choice (these patterns are\nsignificant only in testmode):\n\nEmail AddressEffect`xxx_chargeable@example.com`The source will be created as\n`pending`, but automatically transition to `chargeable` within seconds of its\ncreation.[Charge the\nSource](https://docs.stripe.com/sources/bancontact#charge-request)\nOnce the customer has authenticated the payment, the source’s `status`\ntransitions to `chargeable` and it can be used to make a charge request. This\ntransition happens asynchronously and may occur after the customer was\nredirected back to your website.\n\nSome customers using Bancontact assume that the order process is complete once\nthey have authenticated the payment and received confirmation from their bank.\nThis results in customers who close their browser instead of following the\nredirect and returning to your app or website.\n\nFor these reasons it is essential that your integration rely on\n[webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) to determine when the source\nbecomes chargeable in order to create a charge. Please refer to our [best\npractices](https://docs.stripe.com/sources/best-practices) for more details on\nhow to best integrate payment methods using webhooks.\n\n### Webhooks\n\nThe following webhook events are also sent to notify you about changes to the\nsource’s status:\n\nEventDescription`source.chargeable`A `Source` object becomes `chargeable` after\na customer has authenticated and verified a payment.`source.failed`A `Source`\nobject failed to become chargeable as your customer declined to authenticate the\npayment.`source.canceled`A `Source` object expired and cannot be used to create\na charge.\n### Make a charge request using the source\n\nOnce the source is chargeable, from your `source.chargeable` webhook handler,\nyou can make a charge request using the source ID as the value for the `source`\nparameter to complete the payment.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/charges \\\n -u sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2: \\\n -d amount=\"1099\" \\\n -d currency=\"eur\" \\\n -d source=src_18eYalAHEMiOZZp1l9ZTjSU0\n```\n\nBancontact Sources are\n[single-use](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#single-use-or-reusable) and cannot\nbe used for recurring or additional payments.\n\nRefer to our [Sources & Customers](https://docs.stripe.com/sources/customers)\nguide for more information on how single-use Sources interact with\n[Customers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers).\n\n[Confirm that the charge has\nsucceeded](https://docs.stripe.com/sources/bancontact#charge-confirmation)\nSince Bancontact is a\n[synchronous](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#synchronous-or-asynchronous-confirmation)\npayment method and the customer has already authenticated the payment as part of\nthe redirect, unless there is an unexpected error, the\n[Charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api#charge_object) will immediately succeed.\n\nYou will also receive the following webhook event as the charge is created:\n\nEventDescription`charge.succeeded`The charge succeeded and the payment is\ncomplete.\nWe recommend that you rely on the `charge.succeeded` webhook event to notify\nyour customer that the payment process has been completed and their order is\nconfirmed. Please refer to our [best\npractices](https://docs.stripe.com/sources/best-practices) for more details on\nhow to best integrate payment methods using webhooks.\n\n### Disputed payments\n\nThe risk of fraud or unrecognized payments is extremely low with Bancontact as\nthe customer must authenticate the payment with their bank. As such, there is no\ndispute process that can result in a chargeback and funds withdrawn from your\nStripe account.\n\n### Refunds\n\nPayments made with Bancontact can only be submitted for refund within 180 days\nfrom the date of the original charge. After 180 days, it is no longer possible\nto refund the charge.\n\n### Source expiration\n\nA source must be used within six hours of becoming `chargeable`. If it’s not,\nits status automatically transitions to `canceled` and your integration receives\na `source.canceled` webhook event. Additionally, `pending` sources are canceled\nafter 1 hour if they aren’t used to authenticate a payment.\n\nOnce a source is canceled, the customer’s authenticated payment is refunded\nautomatically—no money is moved into your account. For this reason, make sure\nthe order is canceled on your end and the customer is notified once you receive\nthe `source.canceled` event.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Other supported payment methods](https://docs.stripe.com/sources)\n- [Sources API reference](https://docs.stripe.com/api#sources)\n- [Best practices](https://docs.stripe.com/sources/best-practices)\n\n## Links\n\n- [migrate to the Payment Methods\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/transitioning)\n- [Bancontact payments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bancontact)\n- [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/payments/settings)\n- [Bancontact Terms of Service](https://stripe.com/bancontact/legal)\n- [Bancontact](https://www.bancontact.com/)\n- [Sources](https://docs.stripe.com/sources)\n- [Source](https://docs.stripe.com/api#sources)\n- [push](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#pull-or-push-of-funds)\n- [single-use](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#single-use-or-reusable)\n-\n[synchronous](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#synchronous-or-asynchronous-confirmation)\n- [redirect](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#flow-for-customer-action)\n- [Stripe.js](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements)\n- [Source creation endpoint](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_source)\n- [smallest currency unit](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#zero-decimal)\n- [publishable API key](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys)\n- [iOS](https://docs.stripe.com/mobile/ios/sources)\n- [Android](https://docs.stripe.com/mobile/android/sources)\n- [statement\ndescriptor](https://support.stripe.com/questions/when-i-charge-a-customer-what-will-they-see-on-their-card-statements)\n- [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public)\n- [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks)\n- [best practices](https://docs.stripe.com/sources/best-practices)\n- [Sources & Customers](https://docs.stripe.com/sources/customers)\n- [Customers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers)\n- [Charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api#charge_object)",
