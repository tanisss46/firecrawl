Preparing\nfor SCA helps prevent an increase in declines from European cards, and prepares\nyou in case of early enforcement by banks. Read more about how [enforcement\nvaries by\ncountry](https://support.stripe.com/questions/strong-customer-authentication-sca-enforcement-date).\n\n## Make sure your integration is SCA-ready\n\nYour integration is SCA-ready when you process all of your payments volume using\n[SCA-ready\nproducts](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication#preparing).\nYour business must use an SCA-ready product, such as a recent version of Stripe\nCheckout, Billing, the [Payment Intents\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents), or an SCA-ready partner\nsolution. Additionally, you should:\n\n- Test [3D Secure](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure) (3DS)\nauthentication thoroughly. Use our [regulatory test\ncards](https://docs.stripe.com/testing#regulatory-cards) to ensure that your\nintegration can handle 3DS.\n- For off-session payments, make sure you set up and authenticate the card when\nsaving the payment method, and use the API to [flag off-session\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-and-reuse?platform=web&ui=elements#charge-saved-payment-method).\n- If your business uses the Stripe Billing\n[Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating) or\n[Invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices) APIs, make sure your integration\ncan handle [incomplete\nstatuses](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication).\n\n## Understand incomplete, declined, or failed payments\n\nPayments can be unsuccessful for a number of reasons, including incomplete,\ndeclined, or failed payments. If you look in the Dashboard and see that your\npayments aren’t advancing past the incomplete status (`requires_action` in the\nAPI):\n\n- Make sure that your customer isn’t in the process of authenticating. If\nthey’re authenticating and it’s an on-session payment, they may expect to see\nthis. It’s also possible that they’ve abandoned the checkout flow.\n- Check that you’re [handling next\nactions](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents/verifying-status#next-actions)\nsuch as authentication—next actions failures can also cause payments to fail.\n- For off-session payments, set\n[off_session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-off_session)\nto `true` when creating the payment.\n\nBanks can decline payments that require 3DS authentication but don’t have 3DS\nenabled. Go to the Dashboard to see which payments were declined for this\nreason. For off-session payments, [filter by failed\npayments](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments?status%5B%5D=failed) in the\nDashboard. Hovering over the status badge highlights the decline reason (for\nexample, authentication required). You can view on-session payments by applying\nthe [incomplete payments\nfilter](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments?status%5B%5D=incomplete) and\nseeing if the payment is incomplete, since it requires authentication.\n\nYou may see off-session payments failing even though you think they’re exempt\nfrom SCA requirements. For off-session payments, make sure that you’re\nauthenticating the card when saving card details, either without a payment or\nduring a payment. When saving cards without a payment, use the Setup Intents API\nand set usage to `off_session`. When saving cards during a payment, set\nsetup_future_usage to `off_session`. Finally, be aware that exemptions aren’t\nguaranteed and off-session payments may still require authentication by the\nbank.\n\n## Monitor disputes\n\nWhen monitoring disputes, be aware that payments successfully authenticated\nthrough 3DS fall under the *liability shift* rule. If a cardholder [disputes a\n3D Secure\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure/authentication-flow#disputed-payments)\nas fraudulent, the liability typically shifts from you to the card issuer. If\nthe card issuer applies exemptions, the payment isn’t authenticated through 3D\nSecure, and liability shift doesn’t apply.\n\n## Collect permission to reuse cards\n\nWhen you set up your payment flow to properly save a card with the Payment\nIntents or Setup Intents API, Stripe marks any subsequent off-session payment as\na [merchant-initiated\ntransaction](https://stripe.com/guides/strong-customer-authentication#merchant-initiated-transactions-including-variable-subscriptions)\n(MIT) to reduce the need to authenticate. Merchant-initiated transactions\nrequire an agreement (also known as a *mandate*) between you and your customer.\nAdd terms to your website or application on how you plan to process payments\nthat your customer can opt into. At a minimum, make sure that your terms cover\nthe following:\n\n- The customer’s permission for you to initiate a payment or a series of\npayments on their behalf\n- The anticipated frequency of payments (that is, one-time or recurring)\n- How you determine the payment amount\n\nAdd text in your checkout flow that references the terms of the payment, for\nexample: I authorize [your business name] to send instructions to the financial\ninstitution that issued my card to take payments from my card account in\naccordance with the terms of my agreement with you.\n\n## Use SCA-ready Stripe plugins\n\nIf you’re searching for an SCA-ready plugin, refer to [Stripe\nPartners](https://stripe.com/partners/directory). If you want to migrate an\nexisting Stripe plugin or developer library to support SCA, refer to the [SCA\nmigration guide for plugins and developer\nlibraries](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication/plugins).\n\n## See also\n\n- [SCA readiness](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication)\n\n## Links\n\n- [enforcement varies by\ncountry](https://support.stripe.com/questions/strong-customer-authentication-sca-enforcement-date)\n- [SCA-ready\nproducts](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication#preparing)\n- [Payment Intents API](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents)\n- [3D Secure](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure)\n- [regulatory test cards](https://docs.stripe.com/testing#regulatory-cards)\n- [flag off-session\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-and-reuse?platform=web&ui=elements#charge-saved-payment-method)\n- [Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating)\n- [Invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n- [incomplete\nstatuses](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication)\n- [handling next\nactions](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents/verifying-status#next-actions)\n-\n[off_session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-off_session)\n- [filter by failed\npayments](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments?status%5B%5D=failed)\n- [incomplete payments\nfilter](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments?status%5B%5D=incomplete)\n- [disputes a 3D Secure\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure/authentication-flow#disputed-payments)\n- [merchant-initiated\ntransaction](https://stripe.com/guides/strong-customer-authentication#merchant-initiated-transactions-including-variable-subscriptions)\n- [Stripe Partners](https://stripe.com/partners/directory)\n- [SCA migration guide for plugins and developer\nlibraries](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication/plugins)\n- [SCA readiness](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication)",
