We\nrecommend that you configure your payment methods from the Stripe Dashboard\nusing the instructions in [Accept a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web&ui=stripe-hosted).\n\nIf you want to continue manually configuring the payment methods you present to\nyour customers with Checkout, use this guide. Otherwise, update your integration\nto [configure payment methods in the\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/dashboard-payment-methods).\n\nIntegrating with South Korean cards lets South Korea-based customers pay using\nall local issuer-branded cards issued by South Korean card issuers.\n\nWhen a customer makes a payment, theyâ€™re redirected to the checkout page of our\nlocal processor partner to authenticate and authorize the payment. After the\ncustomer authorizes the payment, Stripe redirects them back to your site.\n\n[Determine\ncompatibility](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/kr-card/accept-a-payment#compatibility)\n[A Checkout\nSession](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/how-checkout-works) must\nsatisfy all of the following conditions to support South Korean payment methods:\n\n- [Prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices) for all line items must be\nexpressed in Korean won (currency code `krw`).\n- The minimum amount accepted is 100 KRW.\n[Accept a South Korean card\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/kr-card/accept-a-payment#accept-a-kr-card-payment)\nEnable South Korean cards by making the following updates to your integration.\n\nWhen creating a [Checkout\nSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions), you must do the\nfollowing:\n\n- Add `kr_card` to the list of `payment_method_types`.\n- Make sure all `line_items` use the `krw` currency.\n\n```\nStripe::Checkout::Session.create({\n mode: 'payment',\n payment_method_types: ['card'],\n payment_method_types: ['card', 'kr_card'],\n line_items: [{\n price_data: {\n currency: 'usd',\n # To accept `kr_card`, all line items must have currency: krw\n currency: 'krw',\n product_data: {\n name: 'T-shirt',\n },\n unit_amount: 2000,\n },\n quantity: 1,\n }],\n success_url: 'https://example.com/success',\n cancel_url: 'https://example.com/cancel',\n})\n```\n\n[Test your\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/kr-card/accept-a-payment#test-integration)\nWhile testing your Checkout integration, select **Local cards** and click\n**Pay**. This redirects you to a Stripe-hosted page where you have the choice to\nauthorize or fail the payment. If you authorize the payment, the PaymentIntent\nswitches from `requires_action` to `succeeded`. Failing the test payment makes\nthe PaymentIntent switch from `requires_action` to `requires_payment_method`.\nLearn more about how to [test](https://docs.stripe.com/testing#redirects)\nredirect-based payment methods.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Accept a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web&ui=stripe-hosted)\n- [configure payment methods in the\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/dashboard-payment-methods)\n- [A Checkout\nSession](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/how-checkout-works)\n- [Prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices)\n- [Checkout Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions)\n- [https://example.com/success](https://example.com/success)\n- [https://example.com/cancel](https://example.com/cancel)\n- [test](https://docs.stripe.com/testing#redirects)",
