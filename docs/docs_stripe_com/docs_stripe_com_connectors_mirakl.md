# Stripe Connector for Mirakl

## Leverage the power of Stripe on Mirakl-built marketplaces.

[Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect) is the perfect fit for
[Mirakl](https://www.mirakl.com/) marketplaces:

- Compatible with all the [payment
methods](https://stripe.com/payments/features#payment-options) offered by
Stripe.
- Works for B2C and B2B marketplaces.
- Supports multi-seller and hybrid orders.
- Automated [payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts) based on your
configuration.

## Integration steps

The main tasks to set up payments for your marketplace using Mirakl are:

- First, you need a Stripe account.
[Register](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register).
- Implement the relevant payment methods. Use one of our [existing
plugins](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors) or [build your own
integration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments).
- [Activate Connect](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/accounts/overview) in
your Dashboard. Choose **Platform or marketplace** as your integration type.
- Configure your [Connect branding
settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/stripe-dashboard/branding).
- [Configure](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/mirakl/configuration) and
[install](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/mirakl/install) the connector on
your test environment.
- Adapt your communication to sellers as described in the [onboarding
workflow](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/mirakl/onboarding-sellers#communication).
- Adapt your payments requests as described in the [payment split
workflow](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/mirakl/payments#payment-validation)
- Test the different workflows: onboarding, payments, refunds, and payouts.
- [Activate](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/onboarding) your Stripe
account.
- Complete your [Platform
profile](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/profile).
- [Configure](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/mirakl/configuration) and
[install](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/mirakl/install) the connector on
your live environment.
- Go live.

Optionally, you can use [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) for fraud
protection or [Stripe Billing](https://docs.stripe.com/billing) to create and
manage [invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices) and recurring payments.
