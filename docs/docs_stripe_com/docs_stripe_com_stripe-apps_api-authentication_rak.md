# Restricted API key authentication

## Generate a permissioned restricted API key (RAK) when a user installs your app.

A user authenticating with the RAK follows these steps.

- On your site, the user clicks a link that redirects them to Stripe.
- On Stripe, the user selects the appropriate account and accepts permissions
for installing the app.
- After the app is installed, it generates a restricted API key provisioned with
the proper permissions.
- The user copies the generated keys and provides them to your site.

[Develop your
app](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/api-authentication/rak#develop-app)-
Create your app using our template.

```
stripe apps create <app-name> --template restricted-api-key-app
```

If you have an existing app, run this command in Stripe CLI:

```
stripe apps set api-access-type restricted_api_key
```
- Add all the
[permissions](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/reference/permissions) that
your app requires.
- Edit your [app settings
page](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/app-settings). If you use the template
above, a settings view is automatically created. We recommend adding
instructions or links to your own documentation on this page for users to
reference when setting up your app.

Example app settings page
- [Upload](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/upload-install-app) your app to
Stripe.

#### Note

After you upload your RAK app, you canâ€™t change the [API authentication
method](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/api-authentication).

```
stripe apps upload
```
[Test your
app](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/api-authentication/rak#test-app)
You can test the RAK authentication on your own account.

- [Install your app in test
mode](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/versions-and-releases#changing-between-versions)
on your account.
- Go to your [installed apps page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/apps)
in settings and click your recently installed app.
- From the app settings page, click **View API keys**. this secret key to
test your integration.

To test your app on a different Stripe account than the one used to develop your
app, use [external testing](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/test-app).
