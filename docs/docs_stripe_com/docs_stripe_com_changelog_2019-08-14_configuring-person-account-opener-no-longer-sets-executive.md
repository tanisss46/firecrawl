# Renames the platform_payments capability for accounts to card_payments, requiring the manual specification of the added transfers capabilityBreaking changes

## What’s new

Includes multiple changes:

- Renames the `platform_payments` capability to `transfers` to better indicate
the Stripe primitives that this capability supports.
- Updates the `card_payments` capability to no longer imply `transfers`. When
creating an account, you now need to additionally request the `transfers`
capability.

## Impact

This change renames the `platform_payments` capability to `transfers` and
decouples it from the `card_payments` capability. You now need to explicitly
request the `transfers` capability when creating an account, even if they also
request `card_payments`. This modification provides clearer terminology and more
granular control over account capabilities.
