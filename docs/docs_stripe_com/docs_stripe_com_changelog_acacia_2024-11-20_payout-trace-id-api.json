  "content": "# Trace payouts with a unique identifier\n\n## What’s new\n\nIntroduces a\n[trace_id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payouts/object#payout_object-trace_id)\nfield on the [Payout](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payouts) resource.\n\n[Trace IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts/trace-id) are unique identifiers for\npayouts that our banking partners create to help you track missing or delayed\npayouts. If an expected payout hasn’t settled in your bank account after 10\nbusiness days, contact your bank for an update and provide the trace ID.\n\nFor Connect users, you can provide your connected accounts their payout trace\nIDs by [retrieving them from the Stripe\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payouts/retrieve).\n\nThis enables your connected accounts to self-serve their late or missing payouts\nwithout the need for manual support intervention.\n\nThe `trace_id` contains two sub-fields:\n[value](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payouts/object#payout_object-trace_id-value)\nand\n[status](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payouts/object#payout_object-trace_id-status):\n\n- `value`: The trace ID string that we retrieve from our banking partners when a\npayout is paid.\n- `status`: The current status of the trace ID during retrieval from our banking\npartners.\nStatusDescription`pending`After you mark a payout as paid, Stripe attempts to\nretrieve the trace ID from the banking partner for up to 10 days. During this\ntime the `status` becomes `pending`.`supported`After the banking partner\nprovides the trace ID, the `status` becomes `supported` and Stripe updates the\n`value`.`unsupported`Some scenarios prevent providing the trace ID, such as a\npayout failure or an unsupported country and currency combination. In these\ncases the `status` is `unsupported`.\n## Impact\n\nYou can get the trace ID for a specific payout by [retrieving the\npayout](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payouts/retrieve).\n\nFor Connect users, providing the trace ID to your connected accounts allows you\nto:\n\n- Minimize support requests from your connected accounts relating to late or\nmissing payouts.\n- Improve user satisfaction by letting your connected accounts self-serve their\nlate or missing payout investigations with their bank.\n\n## Changes\n\nREST APIRubyPythonPHPJavaNodeGo.NETParameterChangeResources or\nendpointstrace_idAdded[Payout](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payouts/object)\n## Upgrade\n\n- [View your current API\nversion](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#view-your-api-version-and-the-latest-available-upgrade-in-workbench)\nin Workbench.\n- If you use an SDK, upgrade to the corresponding SDK version for this API\nversion.- If you don’t use an SDK, update your [API\nrequests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/versioning) to include `Stripe-Version:\n2024-11-20.acacia`\n- Upgrade the API version used for [webhook\nendpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks/versioning).\n- [Test your integration](https://docs.stripe.com/testing) against the new\nversion.\n- If you use Connect, [test your Connect\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/testing).\n- In Workbench, [perform the\nupgrade](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#perform-the-upgrade).
