Use this\nguide to help you decide on the best way to build your integration, and follow\nthe links to in-depth, step-by-step guides.\n\nThis guide is for users who aren’t necessarily writing code, but want to learn\nabout the high-level subscription integration process so that they can create\nplans and organize resources.\n\nIf you already know how you’re going to build your integration, or if you want\nto start coding right away, see our [integration\nbuilder](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/quickstart).\n\n[Subscription\nmodels](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/designing-integration#subscription-models)\nYou need to understand the available subscription models to help you make later\nchoices, such as which pricing model and payment form to use. First, consider\nyour business model:\n\n- If you want customers to pay, then provision access to your service, click the\n**pay up front** tab below to learn more.\n- If you want to collect payment details, then offer customers a free trial\nperiod before billing them, click the **free trial** tab below to learn more.\n- If you want to provide users access to your service without asking them for\nany payment information (a *freemium* model), click the **freemium** tab below\nto learn more.\nPay up frontFree trialFreemium\n\n![Pay-up-front subscription\nmodel](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/sub_model_pay_up_front.6b48054ef005d5ea359d56a3a07b6085.svg)\n\nPay-up-front model\n\nIn the pay-up-front model, you collect payment details and charge customers\nbefore provisioning access to your service. After the initial charge, you\ncontinue to charge customers the same fixed price for the same service at\nregular intervals. In this model, you use the Dashboard or [Subscriptions\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions) manage customer subscriptions.\nIf you want to allow customers to modify their subscriptions directly, you need\nto integrate the [customer portal](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management).\n\nFor example, a photo hosting company that offers basic and premium service\nlevels and charges customers on a monthly basis might have this setup:\n\n- One product for the basic option\n- One product for the premium option\n- One price for the basic option (15 USD per month)\n- One price for the premium option (25 USD per month)\n\nA typical flow for this model would look like the following:\n\n- The customer chooses their plan (basic or premium).\n- You collect payment information.\n- You provision access to your service. You know when to do this by monitoring\n[webhook events](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks).\n- You continue to provision access for customers throughout the lifecycle of the\nsubscription. Check regularly to make sure you’re not providing access if a\ncustomer’s payment has failed.\n\nSee the [integration\nguide](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/build-subscriptions) to\nlearn how to build an integration with a low-code approach that uses a prebuilt\nand hosted page from [Stripe\nCheckout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout) or a custom version with\n[Stripe Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements).\n\n[Metered\nbilling](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/designing-integration#metered-billing)\nIf you need to meter usage, see [metered\nbilling](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models#usage-based-pricing).\nYou need to do this when you [create a\nprice](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/manage-prices#create-price).\n\n[Collect payment\ninformation](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/designing-integration#collect-payment-info)\nIf you don’t want to write a lot of code, use\n[Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout), Stripe’s prebuilt, hosted\npayment page. See the [subscriptions with\nCheckout](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/build-subscriptions?ui=stripe-hosted)\nintegration guide to get started.\n\nIf you want a more customized payment form that you can embed into your existing\nwebsite, use [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements), a set of\nprebuilt UI elements that’s part of\n[Stripe.js](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements).\n\n[Display pricing\ninformation](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/designing-integration#pricing-table)\nEmbed a [pricing table](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/pricing-table)\non your website to show customers pricing information for subscriptions. When\ncustomers choose a subscription option, they’re taken directly to checkout.\nConfigure, customize, and update directly in the\n[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/pricing-tables) without writing\nany code.\n\n[Modify\nsubscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/designing-integration#modify-subs)\nIf you’re collecting payment information with Checkout, you can use the\n[customer portal](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management) to allow\ncustomers to directly update their subscription details, like payment method and\nfrequency. See the [integration\nguide](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/build-subscriptions?ui=stripe-hosted)\nfor detailed instructions on setting this up. (Before integrating, you should\nalso be aware of the [limitations](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management)\nof the portal.)\n\nIf you’re integrating with Elements, you can add a form on the frontend to\ncollect details about the plan they want to change (such as the price ID and\ntheir customer information) and send that to an endpoint on the backend. For\nmore details and sample code, see the section about [letting customers change\ntheir\nplans](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/build-subscriptions?ui=elements#change-price)\nin the Elements quickstart.\n\n[Pricing\nmodels](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/designing-integration#pricing-models)\nIf you’re providing the same good every month and don’t expect that to change,\nuse a simple fixed-price model. If the price varies depending on the number of\nusers or units, you can use volume-based or tier-based prices. For a complete\nlist of available models and a detailed description of each one, see [examples\nof pricing models](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models).\n\n[Set up\nwebhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/designing-integration#webhooks)\nSet up [webhook\nendpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/webhooks) to receive\nnotifications about subscription-related events. For example, when you see the\n`invoice.paid=true` notification, you can safely provision access to your\nservice. See [the subscription\nlifecycle](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview#subscription-lifecycle)\nfor more information about [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) events.\nSee a complete list of [subscription-related\nevents](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview#subscription-events).\nTo learn about managing access to your product’s feature, see\n[Entitlements](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/entitlements).\n\n[OptionalOther\nconsiderations](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/designing-integration#other-considerations)\n\n## Links\n\n- [subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating)\n- [integration builder](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/quickstart)\n- [Subscriptions API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions)\n- [customer portal](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management)\n-\n[checkout.session.completed](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/build-subscriptions#provision-and-monitor)\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements)\n-\n[invoice.paid](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/build-subscriptions#provision-access)\n- [webhook events](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks)\n- [integration\nguide](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/build-subscriptions)\n- [Stripe Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout)\n- [metered\nbilling](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models#usage-based-pricing)\n- [create a\nprice](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/manage-prices#create-price)\n- [subscriptions with\nCheckout](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/build-subscriptions?ui=stripe-hosted)\n- [pricing table](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/pricing-table)\n- [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/pricing-tables)\n- [letting customers change their\nplans](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/build-subscriptions?ui=elements#change-price)\n- [examples of pricing\nmodels](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models)\n- [webhook endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/webhooks)\n- [the subscription\nlifecycle](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview#subscription-lifecycle)\n- [subscription-related\nevents](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview#subscription-events)\n- [Entitlements](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/entitlements)",
