Within test mode you can construct\npayments matching any of the supported conditions on test businesses, allowing\nyou to make sure your integration works correctly. This feature helps you\nidentify any errors or margin loss in your pricing configuration before you go\nlive.\n\n### Test in a sandbox\n\nYou can use [Sandboxes](https://docs.stripe.com/sandboxes) to test pricing\nchanges in an isolated environment. To access sandboxes, click **Sandboxes** in\nthe Dashboard account picker.\n\nEach new sandbox copies the live mode pricing tools configuration to a new test\ninstance. A new sandbox assigns all groups to the default scheme, allowing you\nto configure different defaults and test different grouping strategies.\n\n## Platform pricing testing tool\n\nBefore rolling out a pricing change using pricing tools, you can simulate the\nimpact of a pricing change on historical charges (a before and after simulation)\nwhere you paid the fees.\n\n- From the [Platform\nPricing](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/platform_pricing) page of\nyour Dashboard, click the overflow menu () of the pricing scheme, then select\n**Test**.\n- Enter the ID of a historic charge, then click **Add**. You can add up to 50\ncharges to simulate.\n- Select the charges to compare (or select all), then click **Test\ntransactions**.\n\nThe simulation returns the following information for each transaction:\n\nPropertyDescriptionTransaction amountThe amount on the historical\ncharge.Original application feeThe application fee you collected for this\ncharge.Recalculated application feeThe application fee collected for the same\ncharge according to the pricing scheme changes that you’re testing.Original\nmatched ruleThe conditions of the rule used to calculate the original\napplication fee if a pricing scheme computed it.Recalculated matched ruleThe\nconditions of the rule used to calculate the alternate application fee based on\nthe changes that you’re testing.\nYou can only test charges where your platform paid the Stripe fees. Testing\nagainst a historic charge where you didn’t pay the Stripe fees fails.\n\nIf you’re satisfied with the test, return to the pricing scheme page and either\nsubmit your pricing changes or continue to experiment.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Sandboxes](https://docs.stripe.com/sandboxes)\n- [Platform\nPricing](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/platform_pricing)",
