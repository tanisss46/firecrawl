When these use cases\nhappen, learn how to address disputed payments, understand the nuances of\nliability shifts for Apple Pay charges, and manage refunds effectively.\n\n## Disputes\n\nUsers must authenticate payments with their Apple Pay accounts, helping to\nreduce the risk of fraud or unrecognized payments. However, users can still\ndispute transactions after they complete payment. You can submit evidence to\ncontest a dispute directly. The dispute process is the same as that for card\npayments.

For Visa, liability shift is limited to\ndevices running iOS 16.2 and above. Devices running on iOS versions below 16.2\nonly receive liability shift on Visa if the card was issued in Europe.\n\n## Refunds\n\nYou can partially or fully refund any successful Apple Pay payment. The refund\nprocess is the same as that for card payments. See [Refund and cancel\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/refunds) for instructions on initiating or\nmanaging refunds.\n\n## Links\n\n- [manage disputes](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/responding)\n- [liability\nshift](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure/authentication-flow#disputed-payments)\n- [Refund and cancel payments](https://docs.stripe.com/refunds)",
