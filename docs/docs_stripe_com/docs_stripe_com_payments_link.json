  "content": "# Faster checkout with Link\n\n## Let your customers check out faster with Link.\n\n[Link](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link) allows your customers to select a\nsaved payment method at checkout instead of entering payment information. Your\ncustomers can save their credit cards, debit cards, or US bank accounts for\nfaster checkout at any Link-enabled business. Link also lets you accept [Instant\nBank Payments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/instant-bank-payments). All\nLink transactions confirm immediately, and successful payments settle to your\nStripe balance on the same timeline as card payments, regardless of the payment\nmethod that funds the payment.\n\nCustomers can make changes to their account, view their purchase history, or\nreach out to the Link customer support team by visiting\n[link.com](https://www.link.com/). For information about how your payment\nintegration affects Link, see [Link in different payment\nintegrations](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/link-payment-integrations).\n\n#### Country availability\n\nLink isn’t available in India. In Brazil and Thailand, the [Payment\nElement](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element) doesn’t support Link.\n\n![Add Link to your prebuilt checkout\npage](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/link-in-checkout.2eb9f8d06da3dca74af9b81fa7524049.png)\n\nAdd Link to your prebuilt checkout page\n\n## Link authentication\n\nHere’s how Link authenticates existing customers:\n\n- Link automatically detects if a customer is enrolled by using their email\naddress, phone number, or browser cookie.\n- The customer receives a one-time passcode to authenticate their session.\n- After authentication succeeds, Link autofills their card or bank payment\ndetails and shipping information.\n\nAfter a customer enrolls with Link, they can add backup payment methods and\nchange shipping addresses.\n\nLink works with [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout), [Payment\nLinks](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links), [Web\nElements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements), [Mobile\nElements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/mobile-payment-element-link),\nand [Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing). To accept payments using\nLink, go to your [payment method\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods).\n\n## Link on no-code surfaces\n\n[Link with CheckoutUse Link in your prebuilt checkout page, allowing your\ncustomers to securely save and reuse their payment\ninformation.](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/checkout-link)[Link with\nInvoicingEnable Link in the Hosted Invoice\nPage.](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/invoicing)\n## Link with Elements\n\n[Link in the Payment ElementTrigger Link in the Payment Element whenever a\ncustomer selects a supported payment\nmethod.](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/payment-element-link)[Link in the\nExpress Checkout ElementDisplay Link alongside Apple Pay, Google Pay, and PayPal\nusing the Express Checkout\nElement.](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/express-checkout-element-link)[Link\nin the Mobile Payment ElementAdd Link to your native iOS, Android, and React\nNative apps.](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/mobile-payment-element-link)\n## Link integrations\n\n[Link in different payment integrationsLearn about using Link with dynamic\npayment methods and other\nintegrations.](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/link-payment-integrations)[Build\na custom checkout page that includes LinkUse the Payment Intents API with the\nLink Authentication Element or Payment Element to create a Link-enabled custom\ncheckout\npage.](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/add-link-elements-integration)[Set\nup future payments using Elements and LinkSave your Link customers’ details and\ncharge them later.](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/save-and-reuse)\n## See also\n\n- [Link with Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/checkout-link)\n- [Link with Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/elements-link)\n- [Link with Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/invoicing)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Link](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link)\n- [Instant Bank\nPayments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/instant-bank-payments)\n- [link.com](https://www.link.com)\n- [Link in different payment\nintegrations](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/link-payment-integrations)\n- [Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element)\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout)\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n- [Web Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements)\n- [Mobile\nElements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/mobile-payment-element-link)\n- [Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing)\n- [payment method\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods)\n- [Link with CheckoutUse Link in your prebuilt checkout page, allowing your\ncustomers to securely save and reuse their payment\ninformation.](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/checkout-link)\n- [Link with InvoicingEnable Link in the Hosted Invoice\nPage.](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/invoicing)\n- [Link in the Payment ElementTrigger Link in the Payment Element whenever a\ncustomer selects a supported payment\nmethod.](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/payment-element-link)\n- [Link in the Express Checkout ElementDisplay Link alongside Apple Pay, Google\nPay, and PayPal using the Express Checkout\nElement.](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/express-checkout-element-link)\n- [Build a custom checkout page that includes LinkUse the Payment Intents API\nwith the Link Authentication Element or Payment Element to create a Link-enabled\ncustom checkout\npage.](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/add-link-elements-integration)\n- [Set up future payments using Elements and LinkSave your Link customers’\ndetails and charge them\nlater.](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/save-and-reuse)\n- [Link with Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/elements-link)",
