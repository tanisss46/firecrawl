This doc details the behavior of the different\nvalues it can have.\n\n#### Note\n\nAny activity occurring at the platform account level is billed to your platform\nregardless of the `controller.fees.payer` value on your connected accounts. For\nexample, Stripe charges the platform directly for destination charges (with or\nwithout `on_behalf_of`) and card account updates for cards stored on your\nplatform account.\n\n## Selecting billing behavior\n\nYou can only set the\n[controller.fees.payer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/create#create_account-controller-fees-payer)\nproperty when you create an account.\n\nThe following sections describe the behavior of each value.\n\n### account\n\nStripe collects fees directly from your connected account. We don’t charge any\n[Connect fees](https://stripe.com/connect/pricing) to it or to your platform.\n\nAny application fees that your platform bills to the connected account are in\naddition to Stripe fees.\n\nYou can set the payer type to `account` when you create connected accounts.\nAccounts created with `type=standard` also have this value.\n\n### application\n\nThe platform pays payment fees for direct charges and fees for Stripe products\nlike Radar, Card Account Updater, and Instant Payouts. For complete details, see\n[the table\nbelow](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges-fee-payer-behavior#fee-payer-behaviors).\n\nThe platform also pays [Connect fees](https://stripe.com/connect/pricing) for\nthese accounts .\n\nWe recommend that you monetize payments and Stripe products where the platform\nis billed by collecting fees from your connected accounts.\n\nYou can set the payer type to `application` when you create connected accounts.\n\nPlatforms that pay Stripe payment fees for direct charges can access dedicated\nreports.\n\nSee [Platform Reporting for direct charge payment fees paid by\nplatform](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charge-buy-rate-reporting-overview).\n\n### application_custom or application_express\n\n`application_custom` and `application_express` are assigned to accounts created\nwith `type=custom` and `type=express`, respectively. Their billing behaviors for\ndirect charges and connected account usage of Stripe products matches the\nhistorical behavior of Custom and Express accounts. For complete details, see\n[the table\nbelow](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges-fee-payer-behavior#fee-payer-behaviors).\n\nWe recommend that you monetize payments and Stripe products where the platform\nis billed by collecting fees from your connected accounts.\n\nYou can’t set the payer type to `application_custom` or `application_express`\nwhen you create connected accounts. They only apply to accounts created with\n`type=custom` or `type=express`.\n\n## List of fee behaviors for payer values\n\nProduct Categoryaccountapplicationapplication_customapplication_expressStripe\npayment processing feesConnected AccountPlatformConnected AccountConnected\nAccountInterchange Plus Payment FeesConnected\nAccountPlatformPlatformPlatformDispute feesConnected AccountPlatformConnected\nAccountConnected AccountInstant PayoutsConnected\nAccountPlatformPlatformPlatformLPM Payment Failure FeesConnected\nAccountPlatformConnected AccountConnected AccountPremium PayoutsConnected\nAccountPlatformPlatformPlatformInvoicing and SubscriptionsConnected\nAccountPlatformPlatformPlatformRadarConnected\nAccountPlatformVariesVariesTerminal Add-onsConnected AccountPlatformConnected\nAccountConnected AccountStripe TaxConnected AccountPlatformPlatformPlatform3D\nSecureConnected AccountPlatformVariesVariesAdaptive AcceptanceConnected\nAccountPlatformPlatformPlatformCard Account UpdaterConnected\nAccountPlatformPlatformPlatformCheckout Add-onsConnected\nAccountPlatformPlatformPlatformInstant bank account verificationsConnected\nAccountPlatformPlatformPlatform\n\n## Links\n\n-\n[controller.fees.payer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/create#create_account-controller-fees-payer)\n- [Connect fees](https://stripe.com/connect/pricing)\n- [Platform Reporting for direct charge payment fees paid by\nplatform](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charge-buy-rate-reporting-overview)",
