# Charge for shipping

## Create different shipping rates for your customers.

Shipping rates let you display various shipping options—like standard, express,
and overnight—with more accurate delivery estimates. Charge your customer for
shipping using different Stripe products, some of which require coding. Before
you create a shipping rate, learn how to [collect billing and shipping
addresses](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/no-code/collect-addresses).

#### Third-party plugins

If you’re using a third-party application with Stripe (for example,
[Thrivecart](https://support.thrivecart.com/help/setting-your-physical-fulfilment-shipping-options/)
or
[Shopify](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/shipping/setting-up-and-managing-your-shipping/setting-up-shipping-rates))
and want to adjust the shipping rate, visit the docs for that service.

DashboardAPI- Create a [payment
link](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payment-links/create) and select
**Collect customers’ addresses** with the **Billing and shipping addresses**
option.
- Select the countries you ship to.
- Click **Add shipping rates** to select an existing shipping rate or add a new
one. You can only use shipping rates with one-time prices on payment links.
