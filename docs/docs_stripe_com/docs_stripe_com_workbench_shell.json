  "content": "# Shell and API Explorer\n\n## Use a command line interface to manage your integration and explore APIs.\n\nShell is a command line interface within Workbench that provides many of the\nsame commands built into the [Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli).\nWhen using Workbench, a minimal Shell is always available at the bottom of the\npane, or use the **Shell** tab to launch a full-screen session.\n\nUse the following Shell features to help you manage and debug your Stripe\nintegration:\n\n- **Autocompletion**: Shell provides tab completion for API requests and CLI\ncommands.\n- **API Explorer:** Use the built-in API Explorer to visually explore API\nresources and build API calls from Shell.\n\n#### Note\n\nShell runs in the browser, so it has some limitations when compared to the\n[Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli), which can receive and trigger\nwebhook events on your local machine with a local event listener. See [Test a\nwebhooks integration with the Stripe\nCLI](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks#test-webhook) to learn more.\n\n## Initial setup\n\nSign in to the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/). From the\n**Developers** menu, click **Workbench**. Switch to the **Shell** tab.\n\n#### Common mistake\n\nShell is read-only in live mode. Switch to a\n[sandbox](https://docs.stripe.com/sandboxes) to run API requests that create,\nmodify, or delete API objects.\n\n[Listen for events](https://docs.stripe.com/workbench/shell#listen)- From the\ncommand line prompt, type `stripe listen` to listen for [webhook\nevents](https://docs.stripe.com/event-destinations#events-overview), then press\n**Enter** on your keyboard to run the command.\n\n```\nstripe listen\n```\n\nThis listens to incoming events for your Stripe account.\n\n[Run your first API request](https://docs.stripe.com/workbench/shell#first)-\nClick **New pane** to open a new session in a pane alongside your existing\nsession.\n- the command, paste it into the command line prompt, then press **Enter**\non your keyboard.\n- the object identifier (in `id`) from the response for subsequent\nrequests.\n\n```\nstripe products create \\\n--name=\"Introductory offer (Monthly)\" \\\n--description=\"$0.99 per month\"\n```\n\nThis creates a product with a name and description.\n\n[Use the API Explorer](https://docs.stripe.com/workbench/shell#explorer)- Click\n**API Explorer** to show the interactive API Explorer on the right.\n- Choose the `Products` resource and the `Update` method. The API Explorer shows\nall the required and optional parameters for the Products resource.\n- Paste the object identifier from the previous step into the `Value` for the\n`id` path argument. When you provide the API Explorer with an existing object’s\nidentifier, it loads the properties of the existing product.\n- Update the optional parameter `description` to 1.99 USD per month. The API\nExplorer automatically populates Shell with the equivalent API command to update\nthe product’s description. Press **Enter** to run the command and update the\nproduct.\n- Click **Print SDK code** to see the equivalent code snippet in the language of\nyour choice.\n\n## Available commands\n\nShell provides multiple commands in addition to the `stripe` command (see the\n[Stripe CLI reference](https://docs.stripe.com/cli)).\n\nCommandPurpose`cd`Navigates to other documentation pages`clear`Clears all prior\ntext from the shell`ls`Lists Dashboard pages relative to the current\none`pwd`Prints the current page slug and title`shortcuts`Displays keyboard\nshortcuts that you can use with Shell`stripe`Available Stripe CLI commands (see\nthe [complete reference](https://docs.stripe.com/cli))`whoami`Displays logged in\nmerchant details\n\n## Links\n\n- [Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli)\n- [Test a webhooks integration with the Stripe\nCLI](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks#test-webhook)\n- [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/)\n- [sandbox](https://docs.stripe.com/sandboxes)\n- [webhook events](https://docs.stripe.com/event-destinations#events-overview)\n- [Stripe CLI reference](https://docs.stripe.com/cli)",
