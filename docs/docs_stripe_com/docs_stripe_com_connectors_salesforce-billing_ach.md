# ACH Considerations for Salesforce Billing

## Learn about the ACH considerations for using Stripe for Salesforce Billing and CPQ.

Using Stripe as a payment gateway for ACH means that you canâ€™t create new ACH
payment methods in the Payment Center UI for Accounts. The Payment Center flow
charges the payment method immediately, but Stripe requires an added
verification step when using a bank account for ACH payments. Because of this
incompatibility, adding an ACH payment method from this screen will always fail.

Use the [New Payment Method
ACH](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/salesforce-billing/configuration#add-an-ach-payment-method-button-to-the-related-list-on-account-objects)
flow directly from the **Payment Method Related List** on the **Account** within
Salesforce instead.
