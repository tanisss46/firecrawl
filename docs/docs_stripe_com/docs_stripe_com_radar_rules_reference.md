# Rules reference

## Learn about the structure of rules and the order in which Radar processes them.

Before creating a rule, you need to understand how they’re processed and what
payment attributes you can use to set evaluation criteria. The Stripe
machine-learning fraud systems can block many fraudulent payments for you, but
you can also set up rules that are unique to your business using the [supported
attributes](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules/reference#supported-attributes).

## Rule processing and ordering

[Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) evaluates each payment against the rules
you create according to their action type, using the following prioritization:

- **Request 3DS**: Rules that when used with the [Payment Intents
API](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents) or
[Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout), *request* the issuer to
do [3D Secure authentication](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure) if
supported. Radar evaluates these before any block, review, or allow rules.
- **Allow**: Rules that *allow* a payment to be processed. Payments that fall
under allow rules aren’t evaluated against any block or review rules.
- **Block**: Rules that *block* a payment and reject it. Blocked payments aren’t
evaluated against any review rules.
- **Review**: Rules that allow payments to be processed but then place them in
*review*.

Rules of the same action type aren’t ordered.

If a payment matches the criteria for a rule, Radar takes the appropriate action
and discontinues evaluation. For example, if a payment matches an allow rule,
it’s processed normally, without evaluating any subsequent block or review
rules, even if the payment would also meet their criteria. An example set of
rules might be as follows:

- **Allow** payments less than `$10`
- **Allow** payments made within the US and with a risk level of `normal`
- **Block** payments where the risk level is `high`
- **Block** payments `greater than $1,000`
- **Review** payments made with a card issued `outside the US`

Using the rules above:

- All payments less than 10 USD are processed, regardless of their risk level or
issuing location. Since the first rule allows the payment, no further rules are
evaluated.
- A 1,500 USD payment made within the US with a normal risk level processes
normally because it meets the criteria of the second rule, so isn’t evaluated
against the rule to block payments over 1,000 USD.
- A high risk payment over 1,000 USD is blocked because it doesn’t meet the
criteria of either allow rule, then triggers both block rules, regardless of the
order of evaluation.

## Rule structure

The rule structure has two components—the *action* to take and the *condition*
to evaluate:

`{action} if {condition}`

Together they represent the *predicate*. In practice, a rule to block all
payments over 1,000 USD appears as:

`Block if :amount_in_usd: > 1000.00`

- The *action* is `Block`
- The *condition* is `:amount_in_usd: > 1000.00`

### Actions

A rule performs one of the four actions described in this section when a payment
meets its criteria. The order of the following action types represents the
priority Radar follows when evaluating each rule.

#### Request 3D Secure

When used with the Payment Intents API, this rule determines if Stripe requests
the issuer to attempt [3D Secure
authentication](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure). Requesting 3DS
alone doesn’t block all possible [3D Secure
outcomes](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules#request-3d-secure). Whether or not
there are matches on this rule, we evaluate rules for allow, block, and review
afterward.

#### Allow

This rule determines when to allow a payment that meets certain criteria,
regardless of any of your other matching rules. When a payment matches the
criteria in an allow rule, it’s not subject to further Radar rules evaluation.
Stripe processes the payment normally, but the card issuer might still decline
it.

#### Block

Block rules advise Stripe to always block a payment. If a payment matches the
criteria in a block rule, Stripe rejects it and it’s not subject to further
rules evaluation.

#### Review

You might want to allow certain types of payments but also have the option to
examine them more closely. With review rules, you can [place payments in
review](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews). This is especially useful for
payments that don’t fit common patterns, such as larger payments or payments
from a country that you don’t often ship to. Stripe still processes these
payments and charges the customer, but you have an additional opportunity to
review the order and check for signs of fraud.

When a particular rule is triggered, Radar takes the prescribed action and
discontinues any further rule evaluation.

### Conditions

If a payment matches a rule’s condition, the corresponding action is taken. A
basic condition is, itself, made up of three parts:

`[attribute] [operator] [value]`

- **Attribute**: The attribute of a payment (for example, the *amount* or *type
of card*)
- **Operator**: The arithmetic that compares the attribute to the value (for
example, *greater than* or *not equal to*)
- **Value**: The criteria you want to use (for example, `100.00` or `debit`)

Combining both the action and condition together, the structure of a rule is:

`{action} if {[attribute] [operator] [value]}`

Four types of conditions exist, depending on the attribute type:

- `[string_attribute] [operator] [string_value]`
- `[country_attribute] [operator] [country_value]`
- `[numeric_attribute] [operator] [numeric_value]`
- `[boolean_attribute]`

You can also use attributes as a corresponding value within a condition. For
example, you can create a rule to block payments where the issuing country of
the card doesn’t match the country where the payment took place:

`Block if :card_country: != :ip_country:`

For a list of all possible conditions, refer to the [supported
attributes](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules/reference#supported-attributes).

#### String attributes

These contain any combination of characters. String attributes and values most
commonly represent a piece of text, such as a card’s brand (for example, `visa`,
`amex`) or risk level (for example, `elevated`). You can use these in rules to
allow payments only from a particular country, or block payments made with
prepaid cards.

#### Metadata attributes

These attributes are derived from the [metadata you’ve attached to your
payments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/charges-api#storing-information-in-metadata).
Metadata attributes can operate as either strings or numbers. When used as
strings, metadata attributes are *case-sensitive*.

You can use these attributes when creating Stripe Radar rules, enabling you to
write rules against any custom business attributes you have passed to Stripe in
the metadata field attached to your payments.

Metadata attributes are written in the following structure:

`::[metadata attribute name]:: [operator] [metadata_value]`

For example, suppose we have payments with the following key-value data stored
in the metadata field:

Metadata NameMetadata ValueCustomer Age22Item ID5A381DCategory IDgroceries
You can write a rule to place payments that match the following criteria into
review.

`Review if ::Customer Age:: < 30`

You can also write rules using both metadata attributes and other [supported
attributes](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules/reference#supported-attributes)
mentioned in this document. For example, you can write a rule that only places a
payment in review if the `Item ID` matches `5A381D` and the payment amount
exceeds 1,000 USD.

`Review if ::Item ID:: = '5A381D' and :amount_in_usd: > 1000`

Metadata attributes also support the `IN` operator to match against multiple
values. For example, you can write a rule that places a payment in review if the
`Category ID` is one of groceries, electronics, or clothing.

` Review if ::Category ID:: IN ('groceries', 'electronics', 'clothing')`

You can use the `INCLUDES` operator with rules for metadata attributes and other
string attributes to match substrings. For example, you can write a rule that
places a payment in review if the `Item ID` includes the string `A381`. This
matches A381, 5A381D, A381D, 5A381, and so on.

`Review if ::Item ID:: INCLUDES 'A381'`

#### Caution

Metadata attributes are case-sensitive when used as strings. Make sure that
metadata values you specify in rules are exactly the same as the ones attached
to your payments.

**Metadata on Customer and Destination Objects**

You can also access metadata on customer and destination objects (if those are
used for a given payment). These attributes use the following structure:

`::[customer|destination]:[metadata attribute name]:: [operator]
[metadata_value]`

For example, suppose you had a customer with the following metadata:

Metadata NameMetadata ValueTrustedtrue
You could write a rule that always allows payments if the customer’s `Trusted`
metadata field is `true`.

`Allow if ::customer:Trusted:: = 'true'`

Or if you had a destination with the following metadata:

Metadata NameMetadata ValueCategorynew
You could write a rule that places a payment in review if the destination’s
`Category` metadata field is `new`.

`Review if ::destination:Category:: = 'new'`

#### Country attributes

These use [two-letter country
codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) to represent a country,
such as `US` for United States, `GB` for Great Britain, or `AR` for Argentina.
Country attributes operate the same as string attributes, the only difference
being that the value must be a country code.

#### State attributes

These use [ISO codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2) to represent the
state or principal subdivision of a country, such as `CA` to represent
California of the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2:US),
`ENG` to represent England which is part of [Great
Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2:GB), or `L` to represent La
Pampa which is part of [Argentina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2:AR).
We omit the two-letter country code from the state ISO code, so if you want to
block transactions from California, compare the state attribute to `CA`.

`Block if :ip_state: = 'CA'`

State attributes operate the same as string attributes, the only difference
being that the value must be an ISO code.

#### Numeric attributes

As these contain only numbers, they support more operators than string
attributes and values. A payment’s *amount* is one example of a numeric
attribute. You can create a rule to perform an action if the amount is higher,
lower, equal, or not equal to the amount you specify.

For numeric attributes that are counts over time windows, the count excludes the
payment that you’re currently processing. For example,
`total_charges_per_customer_hourly` represents the number of previous charge
attempts from a given customer in the preceding hour. So, for the first charge
attempt in a given hour for a customer, `total_charges_per_customer_hourly` has
a value of `0`. For a second charge attempt within the same hour, it has a value
of `1`, and so on.

Time-since-first-seen attributes also don’t take into account the payment you’re
currently processing. For example, a payment without an email has a missing
value for `seconds_since_email_first_seen`. So do payments with emails never
seen before on your account (since we don’t include the payment currently being
processed, this is effectively the same behavior as the first example). See
below for more details about [missing
values](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules/reference#missing-attributes). The
`seconds_since_email_first_seen` field is only non-null after a new payment with
a given email is processed.

#### Bounded numeric attributes

Bounded numeric attributes are similar to the numeric attributes described
above. For example, they exclude the payment that you’re currently processing.
The difference is that the available values for bounded numeric attributes are
capped (or *bounded*) at a specific value.

As an example, take `authorized_charges_per_email_hourly` which represents the
number of previous charges that were authorized for the email in the past hour
on your account. For the sake of the example, let’s say it has a bound of `5`.
For the first charge attempt in the past hour with the email
`jenny.rosen@example.com` the counter has a value of `0`. Subsequent charge
attempts in the same hour see higher counter values. After authorizing the 6th
charge within the hour from `jenny.rosen@example.com`, the counter stops
incrementing and stays at `5` despite actually having `6` charge attempts in the
past hour.

If an attempt to increment the counter above the cap occurs, we exclude older
values from consideration and replace them with newer values. For example,
consider a counter with a cap of `3` that’s been filled up with 3 charges. One
way to visualize the counter is by maintaining a list of timestamps representing
arrival times of charges: `[10, 20, 30]` for instance. When a charge arrives at
time `50`, the counter now looks like `[20, 30, 50]`.

#### Boolean attributes

A Boolean attribute represents whether a particular attribute is true. Unlike
string and numeric attributes, Boolean attributes have no operators or values.
You can use a Boolean attribute to block payments that have been made with a
disposable email address, or place payments in review that were made with an
anonymous IP address.

#### Post-authorization attributes

A post-authorization attribute (for example, `:cvc_check:`,
`:address_zip_check:`, or `:address_line1_check:`) requires Stripe to exchange
data with card issuers as part of the authorization process. The card issuer
verifies this data against the information they have on file for the cardholder
and checks for a match. Rules that use post-authorization attributes execute
after rules that don’t use post-authorization attributes. (This won’t affect
whether a charge is blocked or not, but might impact which rule blocks the
charge.)

If you use a post-authorization attribute in a rule, your customer’s statement
might temporarily show an authorization even if the charge is ultimately
blocked—the authorization generally disappears after a few days.

Address ([AVS](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/verification)) and
[CVC](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/verification) attributes have
five possible values:

Attribute valueExplanation`pass`The data provided is correct.`fail`The data
provided is incorrect.`unavailable`The customer’s card issuer won’t check the
data provided. Not all card issuers or countries support address
verification.`unchecked`The data was provided but the customer’s card issuer
hasn’t checked the data provided yet.`not_provided`The data wasn’t provided to
Stripe.
Some example rules:

- `Block if :address_line1_check: = 'fail'`
- `Block if :cvc_check: = 'fail'`
- `Block if :address_zip_check: in ('fail', 'not_provided')`

Requiring a strict `pass` on rules can be overly restrictive. For example,
[wallets](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods) usually don’t
provide a CVC because they store tokenized card information. Therefore
[CVC](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/verification) checks, like
[3D-Secure](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure) checks, aren’t available
for payment methods such as Apple Pay. Stripe recommends using Radar’s [Built-in
rules](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules#built-in-rules), which consider these
edge cases.

#### Supported attributes

Refer to the list of all [supported
attributes](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules/supported-attributes) for a
complete list of attributes you can apply to your rule definitions.

#### Converted amounts

When using `amount_in_xyz`, Stripe automatically determines the converted amount
of any payment when checking if the amount matches your chosen criteria. For
example, if you create a rule using `amount_in_usd` to block all payments
greater than 1,000 USD, Stripe blocks a payment of a lower nominal amount in a
different currency (for example, 900 GBP) if its equivalent converted value
exceeds 1,000 USD.

#### “Takes into account payments from 2020 onwards” in practice

The descriptions of some rule attributes include the phrase “takes into account
payments from 2020 onwards”. This means that the rule treats a card that last
transacted with your business in 2019 the same as a card that’s new to your
business. Consider what this means in the context of your business and rules as
it could result in counterintuitive behavior. For example, if you create a rule
to block high-value payments from new cards, you might end up blocking a good
customer who hasn’t made a purchase since 2019.

#### “This attribute only includes live mode Customer objects that interacted with your account in the past <week, year>. This data updates at most every 72 hours.” in practice

The descriptions of some rule attributes include the sentences “This attribute
only includes live mode Customer objects that interacted with your account in
the past <week, year>. This data updates at most every 72 hours.” This means
that live mode Customer objects that were created, charged, or updated on your
account in the past week or year are included in these counts. However, the
count doesn’t update immediately and might take up to 72 hours to propagate
through the system, though often times these counters update sooner than 72
hours.

### Operators

A condition’s operator denotes the comparison between the payment’s attribute
and the value you provide. Different operators are available, depending on the
type of attribute being used.

OperatorStringMetadataCountryStateNumericDescriptionExample=✔︎✔︎✔︎✔︎✔︎Equal
to`:card_country: = 'us'`!=✔︎✔︎✔︎✔︎✔︎Not equal to`:card_funding: !=

'192.168'`LIKE✔✔︎✔✔Matches the given pattern. Use the wildcard character `%` to
match zero or any number of letters, digits, or symbols.`:email: LIKE
'fraud%@stripe.com'`
### Lists

You can reference a group of values in your rules through
[lists](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/lists). All list aliases referenced in
rules must start with `@`. To construct a rule referencing a list, follow the
structure:

`{action} [attribute] in [list]`

For example, say you have a list of card countries you’d like to block. You
could write a rule using several `OR` clauses:

`Block if :card_country: = 'CA' OR :card_country: = 'DE' OR :card_country: =
'AE'`

You could also write a rule using an inline list:

`Block if :card_country: IN ('CA', 'DE', 'AE')`

You could also create a list of card countries you want to block, named
`card_countries_to_block`. You can then
[add](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/lists#custom-lists) the countries of your
choice to the list and reference that list in a rule:

`Block if :card_country: in @card_countries_to_block`

Referencing a list in a rule allows you to edit a large number of items in one
place instead of maintaining many individual rules.

#### EU Businesses

EU businesses: Be aware of the Geo-blocking Regulation and its prohibitions on
blocking payments from customers based in EU member states. [Learn more about
this
regulation](https://support.stripe.com/questions/eu-geo-blocking-regulation-changes).

### Missing attributes

Typical rule conditions refer to attributes set on every payment, such as
`:card_country:` (which is set on every card-based charge) or a metadata
attribute you always send with your payment requests. In some scenarios an
attribute might be missing, for example:

- You have different checkout flows on your site, and some of them don’t collect
customers’ email addresses
- You’ve only recently started using Stripe.js, and so `:ip_country:` is
available on new payments, but not available on historical payments (which we
search when previewing rules)
- For some of your payments, a bug in your integration fails to set an expected
metadata key

#### How rule conditions evaluate missing attributes

Consider the rule `Block if :email_domain: = 'definitelyfraud.com'`. If you
didn’t collect the customer’s email address, the `:email_domain:` attribute
doesn’t exist, so the rule condition doesn’t match the payment.

Now consider the rule `Review if :email_domain: != 'definitelysafe.com'`. If the
`:email_domain:` attribute is missing, this rule *also* doesn’t match the
payment. It might seem like a match because no value isn’t
`'definitelysafe.com'`. However, we interpret `!= 'definitelysafe.com'` to mean
“the attribute has some value other than `'definitelysafe.com'`,” which a
missing attribute doesn’t satisfy. Missing attribute information is also carried
forward when using the `NOT` operator, so the rule `Review if NOT
(:email_domain: = 'definitelysafe.com')` similarly doesn’t match the payment if
the `:email_domain:` attribute is missing.

More generally: any comparison (for example, `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`) of a missing
feature against another static value or feature (missing or present) always
returns false. Usage of the `NOT` operator with any comparison containing a
missing feature always returns false.

#### Explicit handling with the `is_missing` function

If you want to explicitly check for the existence of an attribute or metadata
attribute, use the `is_missing` function. Provide this function with the
attribute or metadata key that might be missing.

For example, you could write a rule to match all payments where you don’t have
access to a customer’s email address:

- `Review if is_missing(:email_domain:)`

Or you might write a rule to match all payments that have a certain metadata
attribute set:

- `Review if !(is_missing(::foo::))`

You can also use the `is_missing` function in `OR` or `AND` conjunctions:

- `Review if is_missing(:email_domain:) OR :email_domain: IN ('yopmail.net',
'yandex.ru')`

### Complex conditions

You can build complex conditions by joining together basic conditions using the
operators **AND**, **OR**, and **NOT**. You can also use their symbolic
equivalents: **&&**, **||**, and **!** respectively.

Similar to programming languages such as C, Python, and SQL, Stripe supports
standard operator *precedence* (order of operations). For instance, the complex
condition:

`{condition_X} OR NOT {condition_Y} AND {condition_Z}`

is interpreted as:

`{condition_X} OR ((NOT {condition_Y}) AND {condition_Z})`

Sub-conditional grouping within complex conditions is also supported using
parentheses. For instance, you can amend the prior example to explicitly change
the evaluation order of sub-predicates:

`({condition_X} OR (NOT {condition_Y})) AND {condition_Z}`

`{condition_X} OR NOT ({condition_Y} AND {condition_Z})`

By using parentheses in different locations, each of these complex conditions
lead to different results.

### Valid conditions

The following conditions are examples of correct use of attributes and a
supported operator:

- `:card_brand: = 'amex'`
- `:card_country: != 'US'`
- `:amount_in_usd: >= 1000.00`
- `:is_anonymous_ip:`

### Invalid conditions

When creating a rule, Radar provides feedback if you attempt to use an invalid
condition. For reference, the following are examples of invalid conditions,
where the value for an attribute or the operator used isn’t supported:

- `:risk_level: < 'highest'` (string values can only make use of = or !=
operators)
- `:ip_country: = 'Canada'` (country values must be expressed in two-letter
short code)
- `:amount_in_usd: >= 'one thousand dollars'` (numeric values must be expressed
in numbers)
- `:is_anonymous_ip: = 'true'` (Boolean attributes are not used with operators
or values)

### Velocity rules

Many [supported
attributes](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules/supported-attributes) include
invariants for different time scales (for example, the `daily` in
`total_charges_per_email_daily`). These are called velocity rules.

Stripe calculates attributes using bucket increments. The increment length
varies based on the attribute interval. This means the velocity for any
attribute might include data that occurred within the interval plus one bucket.
For example, an hourly attribute interval might be 3900 seconds (one hour and
five minutes) of the current transaction because the interval uses five minute
buckets.

The attributes are defined as:

- `hourly` is up to 3900 seconds (5 minute buckets)
- `daily` is up to 90000 seconds (1 hour buckets)
- `weekly` is up to 608400 seconds (1 hour buckets)
- `yearly` is up to 31622400 seconds (1 day buckets)
- `all_time` includes 5 years of data with velocity up to 31622400 seconds (1
day buckets)

A common use case for these attributes is to reduce [card
testing](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/card-testing#prevent-card-testing)
or enumeration attack scenarios, as explained in the [Radar 101
guide](https://stripe.com/guides/radar-rules-101#rules-that-help-prevent-card-testing-or-card-cashing).
