However, invoices you create with the API won’t\nautomatically finalize. You must turn on automatic collection by setting the\n[auto_advance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update#update_invoice-auto_advance)\nproperty on the invoice to `true`. You must also configure a webhook endpoint to\nreceive their associated events. When you set `auto_advance` to `false`, you’re\nresponsible for transitioning the invoice between statuses. Learn more about\n[webhook endpoints and finalizing\ninvoices](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/webhooks#understand).\n\n#### Note\n\nWhen you turn on automatic collection, Stripe does everything to drive the\ninvoice towards payment—including automatically finalizing draft invoices after\none hour. During this wait period, the invoice shows a **Scheduled** status.\n\n## Update automatic advancement\n\nYou can toggle the `auto_advance` property on `draft` and `open` invoices.\nAutomatic advancement and collection never occur on invoices that are marked\n`uncollectible`, `void`, or `paid`. For these invoices, `auto_advance` is always\nset to `false`:\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/invoices/id \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d auto_advance=false\n```\n\n## Pause automatic advancement\n\nIn some cases, you might want to stop Stripe from automatically advancing your\ninvoices toward collection. For example, if you want to:\n\n- Use your own business logic to manage the lifecycle of an invoice.\n- Decide if and when to send invoice emails on a per-invoice basis.\n\nIn both of these cases, use the `auto_advance` property to disable the automatic\nadvancement and collection behavior.\n\n## Automatic advancement feature comparison\n\nWhen you set `auto_advance` to `false`, Stripe disables most of the automatic\nfeatures for Invoicing—leaving collection up to you. The following table\noutlines some key changes in the behavior of automatic collection, depending on\nwhether `auto_advance` is set to `true` or `false`:\n\nFeatureTrueFalseFinalize drafts to open (after [approximately\n1-hour](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview#subscription-lifecycle))Emailing\ninvoices Attempting paymentsRetries (email and charge) Invoice reminder emails\n3D Secure reminder emails Email receipts [Stripe\nAutomation](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/automations)\n#### Legend\n\n- = Can be enabled depending on your settings.\n- = Configurable in your settings.\n- = Not enabled.
