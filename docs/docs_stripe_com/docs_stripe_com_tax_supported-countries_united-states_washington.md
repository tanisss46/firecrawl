## How we calculate taxes

Stripe calculates the taxes that apply to your customer’s location.

## Report and file your taxes

Stripe provides reports of your completed tax transactions. Go to
[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations) to access these
reports.

### Exports

The tax transaction data export provides a comprehensive and aggregated view of
transactions by location, including a breakdown of individual tax amounts. Learn
more about [tax reporting exports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports#exports).

### Location reports

[Location reports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports#us-location-reports)
offer a summary of transaction and refund data for specific US locations and
align with Washington filing requirements. You have the option to report on an
annual, quarterly, or monthly basis.

Reporting-specific considerations:

- Washington requires wholesale sales to be identified because they’re subject
to a lower tax rate instead of being completely exempt. When a report contains
any customer-exempt transactions, it displays a warning message. For a detailed
breakdown of each transaction, [export the transaction
data](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports#exports).

### Filing

Stripe Tax has filing partners—Taxually, Marosa, and Hands-off Sales Tax
(HOST)—to help automate your tax filing. These partners automatically sync your
tax transaction data in real time, eliminating the need for manual data entry or
file transfers. Learn more about [tax
filing](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/filing).
