Registered businesses (適格請求書等発行事業者)​​ can issue this type of invoice.\nThere’s no obligation to issue invoices for Business-to-Consumer (B2C) sales.\n\nInvoices (適格請求書)Receipts (適格簡易請求書)\nWe don’t automatically populate all of the fields on an invoice. In Japan, a\nmissed or improperly added field can render an invoice noncompliant. If you\nintend to utilize the Qualified Invoice System, make sure that you include the\nrequired fields when you prepare your invoices.\n\nYou can use [tax calculation with Stripe Tax or Tax\nRates](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/taxes/collect-taxes) to assist with\nincluding tax information in your invoices.\n\n![A sample invoice with various fields annotated, to be referenced against the\ntable\nbelow](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/invoice-japan-config-annotations.91eb9198fe857fae2b437125d15460a1.png)\n\n## How to add an invoice field\n\nThe following table explains the ways that you can populate different invoice\nfields with reference to the Qualified Invoice System. To make sure that your\ninvoices are compliant and adhere to applicable geographic requirements, we\nrecommend that you consult with your tax and legal advisors.\n\nKeyFieldRequirementsHow to populate1Invoice numberThere’s no requirement to show\ninvoice numbers.Stripe populates this by default. You can change how invoices\nare numbered (customer or account level) in the [Invoice\ntemplate](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/invoice).2Date of\nissueYou must use this field to list the transaction date (取引年月日), or set line\nitem supply dates.Stripe populates this by default.3Date dueWhile there’s no\nrequirement to display the date that a customer must pay an invoice by, it’s a\nbest practice to do so.Stripe populates this by default.4aBusiness company name\n(適格請求書発行事業者の氏名又は名称)This is required.Stripe populates this by default from the\nvalue in [Public business\ninformation](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public) section of the\nDashboard.4bBusiness company addressThere’s no requirement to display your\naddress.Enter your Support address under [Public business\ninformation](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public). You can also default\nto your business address as listed in your [account\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/account).5Business registration\nnumber​​Invoices require a business registration number (適格請求書発行事業者の登録番号).You\nmust add your business registration number as JP TRN in your [invoice\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/invoice). Then, each\ntime you create an invoice, you must set it as your Tax ID under Additional\noptions.6aRecipient name (書類の交付を受ける事業者の氏名又は名称)This is required.Stripe populates\nthis by default from the Customer details.6bRecipient addressThere’s no\nrequirement to display the recipient address.You can add this field by clicking\nthe Additional details button when you first create a customer.7Name of the good\nor service (取引内容)This is required.Stripe populates this by default from the\nInvoice Items.8Invoice line item supply date (取引年月日)This is required when the\nsupply date of individual line items is different from the invoice send date.You\ncan display line item supply dates by clicking the toggle under Item\noptions.9Price of the good or serviceIt’s considered a best practice to show the\nunit price, quantity, and total payable amount for each invoice line item.Stripe\npopulates this by default.10Invoice line item tax rate percentageThis is\nrequired to indicate if an item is subject to the reduced tax rate (軽減税率). It’s\nsufficient to display the tax percentage amount for an invoice line item. You\naren’t required to display the cash amount of the tax per invoice line\nitem.Determine the tax to display on an invoice using either of the following\nmethods:- Use [Stripe Tax](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/invoicing) to\nautomatically calculate the tax.\n- Or, manually add the tax rate when you create an item:- Select **Item taxes\nand coupons**.\n- Enter your desired tax rate.\n- **Create a new tax rate**.\n- On the [invoice\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/invoice) page, configure\nthe taxes to round after subtotaling. This setting applies to all invoices\ngenerated from your account.\n11Invoice subtotal (excludes tax)This is required.Stripe populates this by\ndefault.12Total tax amounts and rates (税率ごとに区分して合計した対価の額、適用税率、消費税額)This is\nrequired and must include the total tax amount per tax rate.Stripe populates\nthis by default.13Invoice total (includes tax)This is required.Stripe populates\nthis by default.\n## Facilitate customer payment\n\nAfter you set up your invoices to meet Japanese requirements, you can facilitate\ncustomer payment by:\n\n- Adding the most popular Japanese payment methods. By accepting a wider range\nof payment methods, such as [Bank\nTransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bank-transfers), you can lower your\ncosts and increase conversions (especially with large customers).\n- Using the [Hosted Invoice\nPage](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/hosted-invoice-page).\n- [Localizing your\nInvoices](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/customize#customer-language) to the\nlanguage of your customers.\n- Allowing a single invoice to be [paid over multiple due\ndates](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/payment-plans). By reflecting a payment\nschedule, you can extend more flexible net terms or collect a deposit.\nIf you provide a financial product or service, please consult with your legal\nadvisors regarding applicable restrictions and requirements before setting up\ninvoices. Installment payments, lending, credit, and Buy Now Pay Later services\nare subject to regulation in Japan and you may need to register or obtain\napprovals before engaging in those services.\n\n## Refunds (適格返還請求書)\n\nIf you need to produce a refund document (適格返還請求書) for your customer, you can\n[issue a credit note](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/dashboard/credit-notes).\nIf you’ve completed the steps above to create invoices with the necessary\nfields, such as your business registration number (適格請求書発行事業者の登録番号), the credit\nnotes will also contain them.\n\n## Connect platforms\n\nMake sure your connected account’s invoices contain the necessary information\nrequired by the Qualified Invoice System, such as the account’s tax ID and\nbusiness details. You can [configure the\ninformation](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/connect#account-tax-ids) shown on\ninvoices and receipts that Connect creates.\n\nIf you use manual taxes on invoices,\n[configure](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/taxes/tax-rates#rounding) the taxes\nto round after subtotaling, rather than at the line item level. This setting\napplies to all invoices generated across your connected accounts and across\ndifferent geographies.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Customize invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/customize)\n- [Payment methods](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/payment-methods)\n- [Account tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/taxes/account-tax-ids)\n- [Tax rates and IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/taxes/tax-rates)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Qualified Invoice\nSystem](https://www.nta.go.jp/taxes/shiraberu/zeimokubetsu/shohi/keigenzeiritsu/pdf/0020006-027.pdf)\n- [tax calculation with Stripe Tax or Tax\nRates](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/taxes/collect-taxes)\n- [Invoice template](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/invoice)\n- [Public business information](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public)\n- [account settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/account)\n- [Stripe Tax](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/invoicing)\n- [new tax rate](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/tax-rates)\n- [Bank Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bank-transfers)\n- [Hosted Invoice Page](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/hosted-invoice-page)\n- [Localizing your\nInvoices](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/customize#customer-language)\n- [paid over multiple due\ndates](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/payment-plans)\n- [issue a credit\nnote](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/dashboard/credit-notes)\n- [configure the\ninformation](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/connect#account-tax-ids)\n- [configure](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/taxes/tax-rates#rounding)\n- [Customize invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/customize)\n- [Payment methods](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/payment-methods)\n- [Account tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/taxes/account-tax-ids)\n- [Tax rates and IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/taxes/tax-rates)",
