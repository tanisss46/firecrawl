  "content": "# Collect on-receipt tips\n\n## Learn how to allow customers to add tips to receipts.\n\nAvailable in: \nSome business types allow customers to add a tip to a transaction after\nauthorizing the card. This is most common for businesses in the dining and\nhospitality space (for example, a restaurant or bar), where a customer can add a\ntip onto the receipt.\n\nIn the US, after you confirm a\n[PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents), you can collect a\ntip by capturing more than the authorized amount. This is known as over-capture.\nAfter you capture the PaymentIntent, your customer sees the full captured amount\nreflected on their statement.\n\nTo collect a tip, you must create and confirm a PaymentIntent following the\nsteps outlined in [collecting in-person\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/collect-card-payment). You\ncan verify that a given PaymentIntent is eligible for over-capture by accessing\n[overcapture_supported](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-payment_method_details-card_present-overcapture_supported).\n\nNext, [capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/capture) more than\nthe authorized amount by providing an\n[amount_to_capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/capture#capture_payment_intent-amount_to_capture)\nthat’s equal to the sum of the confirmed PaymentIntent and tip amount.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents/{{PAYMENT_INTENT_ID}}/capture \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d amount_to_capture=1800\n```\n\nOver-capturing updates the PaymentIntent\n[amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-amount)\nto reflect the new total, inclusive of the tip. This doesn’t result in an\nadditional authorization, so your customer won’t see any immediate updates on\ntheir credit card statement. To see the original amount authorized, use the\n[amount_authorized](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-payment_method_details-card_present-amount_authorized)\nfield in the PaymentIntent’s underlying\n[Charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges) object.\n\n## Limits\n\nYou can over-capture up to 50% of the PaymentIntent’s authorized `amount`, or 50\nUSD, whichever is greater. For example, if your PaymentIntent’s authorized\n`amount` is 40 USD, you can capture up to 90 USD; if your PaymentIntent’s\n`amount` is 100 USD, you can capture up to 150 USD.\n\nIf you need to capture more than these limits allow, there are two options:\n\n- If your MCC is eligible, you can use [incremental\nauthorization](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/incremental-authorizations)\nto increase the PaymentIntent’s `amount`.\n- You can create a new PaymentIntent to capture the tip amount using the\n[generated_card](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-last_payment_error-payment_method-card-generated_from-payment_method_details-card_present-generated_card)\npayment method from the first PaymentIntent.\n\n## Availability\n\nOn-receipt tipping is available for United States businesses with eligible\nmerchant category codes (MCCs), for payments using Visa, Mastercard, Discover,\nand American Express card brands.\n\nBusinesses in the following categories are eligible to collect tips using\nover-capture:\n\n- Taxicabs and limousines\n- Eating places and restaurants\n- Drinking places (alcoholic beverages)\n- Fast food restaurants\n- Beauty and barber shops\n- Health and beauty spas\n\n#### Merchant category codes (MCCs)\n\nIf you’re not sure about the eligibility of your merchant category, you can\ncontact [support](https://support.stripe.com/contact). If you’re a\n[Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect) user, [set the merchant category\ncodes](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/setting-mcc) for your connected accounts\nto match their businesses.\n\n## Links\n\n- [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents)\n- [collecting in-person\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/collect-card-payment)\n-\n[overcapture_supported](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-payment_method_details-card_present-overcapture_supported)\n- [capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/capture)\n-\n[amount_to_capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/capture#capture_payment_intent-amount_to_capture)\n-\n[amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-amount)\n-\n[amount_authorized](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-payment_method_details-card_present-amount_authorized)\n- [Charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges)\n- [incremental\nauthorization](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/incremental-authorizations)\n-\n[generated_card](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-last_payment_error-payment_method-card-generated_from-payment_method_details-card_present-generated_card)\n- [support](https://support.stripe.com/contact)\n- [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)\n- [set the merchant category codes](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/setting-mcc)",
