## What’s new

A `status_transitions` hash for invoices now contains the timestamps when an
invoice was finalized, paid, marked uncollectible, or voided.

## Impact

This change adds a `status_transitions` hash to invoices, containing timestamps
for key status changes such as finalization, payment, being marked
uncollectible, or voided. You can now access precise timing information for
these important invoice state changes.
