# Revenue Recognition overview

## Automate your accrual accounting process with Stripe Revenue Recognition.

Revenue recognition is a fundamental part of accrual accounting. Generally
accepted accounting principles (GAAP) state that you recognize revenue when you
realize and earn it, which might be earlier or later than when you actually
receive cash. Correctly recognizing and deferring revenue enables you to have
the most accurate insights into your business profitability and financial
health.

## Who needs revenue recognition

Revenue recognition is critical for many types of businesses, especially:

- Public companies or large businesses with over 25 million USD in annual
revenue—because they’re legally required to comply with ASC 606 and GAAP and
IFRS accounting standards.
- Startups that need to follow accrual accounting to raise money from investors
or get a loan from a bank.
- Subscription and service-based businesses.
- Businesses where customers pay up front before receiving a good or service.

Revenue recognition can provide these businesses with a clear picture of their
performance.

Revenue recognition gets complicated quickly as businesses scale with larger
product lines and increased payment volumes. For subscription businesses that
need to manage changes, refunds, disputes, and prorations, revenue recognition
can be especially complex. Such subscription updates can complicate the process
of recognizing and deferring revenue accurately and compliantly.

### New accounting standards

On May 28, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) jointly issued [Accounting
Standards Codification (ASC) 606](https://asc.fasb.org/606/tableOfContent), a
new framework for businesses to recognize revenue from contracts with customers.
