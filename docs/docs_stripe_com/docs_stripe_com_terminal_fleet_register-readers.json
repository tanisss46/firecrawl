The process for\nregistering your reader to a location differs based on whether it’s a [smart\nreader](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/smart-readers) or a [mobile\nreader](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/mobile-readers).\n\nAny [user role](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/teams/roles) with\nwrite permissions can register readers.\n\n## Smart readers\n\nYou can register smart readers in one of three ways:\n\n- Registration code\n- Serial number\n- Order number\n\n### Registration code\n\nFor this method, you must generate a pairing code (also known as a registration\ncode) on the reader. If a reader isn’t registered, a pairing code automatically\nappears on the screen when you unbox it. If it isn’t, or if you need to\nre-register a reader, you can generate a new pairing code using the [admin\nsettings](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/setup-reader/stripe-reader-s700#settings).\nAfter generating the pairing code, you can enter it in the Dashboard or API to\nregister the reader.\n\nDashboardAPI- On the **Readers** tab on the [Terminal\nReaders](https://dashboard.stripe.com/terminal/readers) page, click **Register\nReader**.\n- Enter the pairing code on the reader and click **Next**.\n- Provide a name for the reader.\n- Assign to a location or create a new one.\n- Confirm the details and click **Register**.\n\n### Serial number\n\nYou can register readers using their serial number. This method doesn’t require\nsomeone to physically have the reader to register it, so you can use it\nimmediately after you unbox it. This method also allows you to re-register the\nreader without the need to physically have the reader to generate a pairing\ncode.\n\nYou can find the serial number in four ways:\n\n- From the hardware order on the [Hardware\nOrders](https://dashboard.stripe.com/terminal/hardware_orders) tab\n- From the [Hardware Order Devices\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_order_devices)\n- On the reader itself (on the box and the back of the reader)\n- If the reader is already registered, from the reader details page in the\nDashboard or the [Reader API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers)\n\n#### Note\n\nThis method only works for readers that were ordered by the account. For\nPlatforms, the platform or the sub-account must have placed the order to\nregister it to a sub-account.\n\n#### Note\n\nThis method allows you to register up to 10 readers at a time.\n\nDashboardAPI\nAfter you find the serial number, you can register the reader through the\nregistration flow in the Dashboard.\n\n- On the [Terminal Readers](https://dashboard.stripe.com/terminal/readers) page,\nclick **Register reader**.\n- Enter the serial number and click **Next**. To register multiple devices at\nonce, you can enter multiple serial numbers, separated by commas.\n- Optionally, choose a name for the reader.\n- If you already created a location, select the reader’s new location.\nOtherwise, create a location by clicking **+ Add new**.\n- Click **Register** to finish registering your reader.\n\n### Order number\n\n#### Note\n\nThis method only works for readers that were ordered by the account (or one of\ntheir sub-accounts). If the reader isn’t associated with an order with that\naccount, this method won’t work.\n\nDashboardAPI\nIn the Dashboard, you can register readers by the order number in one of two\nways:\n\n- From the order itself\n- Entering the order number during the registration flow\n\n#### From the order\n\n- On the [Hardware\norders](https://dashboard.stripe.com/terminal/hardware_orders) page, find an\norder with a status of either `shipped` or `delivered`. Click the overflow menu\n() at the end of the row, then click **Register**.\n- On the Register Readers page, select one or more readers from the hardware\norder to register, then click **Register**.\n- Optionally, choose a name for the reader. If you selected multiple readers,\nthe name serves as a prefix and we name the readers sequentially (for example,\nfor a given input of “Test reader”, we name the readers “Test reader 1”, “Test\nreader 2”, and so on).\n- If you already created a location, select the reader’s new Location.\nOtherwise, create a Location by clicking **+ Add new**.\n- Click **Register** to finish registering your readers.\n\n#### Registration flow\n\n- On the [Terminal Readers](https://dashboard.stripe.com/terminal/readers) page,\nclick **Register reader**.\n- Enter the order number and click **Next**. If there are registerable readers\nin the order, continue by clicking **Register**.\n- On the **Register Readers** page, select one or more readers from the hardware\norder to register, then click **Register**.\n- Optionally, choose a name for the reader. If you selected multiple readers,\nthe name serves as a prefix and we name the readers sequentially (for example,\nfor a given input of “Test reader,” we name the readers “Test reader 1,” “Test\nreader 2,” and so on).\n- If you already created a location, select the reader’s new location.\nOtherwise, create a location by clicking **+ Add new**.\n- Click **Register** to finish registering your readers.\n\n## Mobile readers\n\niOSAndroidReact Native\nRegister mobile readers ([Stripe Reader\nM2](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/readers/stripe-m2), [BBPOS Chipper 2X\nBT](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/connect-reader?reader-type=bluetooth#connect-reader),\nand [BBPOS WisePad\n3](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/connect-reader?reader-type=bluetooth#connect-reader))\nto a location while connecting to the reader by specifying the `locationId` in\nyour `BluetoothConnectionConfiguration`. If you prefer, you can register the\nreader to the last used location by passing in the `reader.locationId` from a\ndiscovered reader.\n\n```\n// Call `connectReader` with the selected reader and a connection config\n// to register to a location as set by your app.\nlet connectionConfig: BluetoothConnectionConfiguration\ndo {\nconnectionConfig = try BluetoothConnectionConfigurationBuilder(delegate:\nyourMobileReaderDelegate, locationId: \"{{LOCATION_ID}}\")\n .build()\n} catch {\n // Handle the error building the connection configuration\n return\n}\nTerminal.shared.connectReader(selectedReader, connectionConfig:\nconnectionConfig) { reader, error in\n if let reader = reader {\n print(\"Successfully connected to reader: \\(reader)\")\n } else if let error = error {\n print(\"connectReader failed: \\(error)\")\n }\n}\n```\n\n## Links\n\n- [smart reader](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/smart-readers)\n- [mobile reader](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/mobile-readers)\n- [user role](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/teams/roles)\n- [admin\nsettings](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/setup-reader/stripe-reader-s700#settings)\n- [Terminal Readers](https://dashboard.stripe.com/terminal/readers)\n- [Hardware Orders](https://dashboard.stripe.com/terminal/hardware_orders)\n- [Hardware Order Devices\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_order_devices)\n- [Reader API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers)\n- [Stripe Reader M2](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/readers/stripe-m2)\n- [BBPOS Chipper 2X\nBT](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/connect-reader?reader-type=bluetooth#connect-reader)",
