  "content": "# Test Financial Connections\n\n## Learn how to test your integration with simulated Financial Connections accounts.\n\n[Get started with test\nmode](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/testing#get-started)\nTo use the test mode features of Financial Connections, follow the relevant [use\ncase guide](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/use-cases) using a\ntest API key. Accounts and customers that you make in test mode are invisible to\nyour live mode integration.\n\n#### Note\n\nThe Financial Connections [authentication\nflow](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/fundamentals#authentication-flow)\nis subject to change, so we don’t recommend automated client-side testing.\nStripe’s test mode API is also strictly [rate\nlimited](https://docs.stripe.com/testing#rate-limits), which you must account\nfor in your tests.\n\n[How to use test accounts and\ninstitutionsServer-side](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/testing#web-how-to-use-test-accounts)\nWhen you provide [Stripe.js](https://docs.stripe.com/js) with a Financial\nConnections Session token created using test keys, the [authentication\nflow](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/fundamentals#authentication-flow)\nexclusively shows a selection of test institutions managed by Stripe. The client\ncan link accounts from any of these institutions without providing credentials.\n\nFeatures like\n[balances](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/balances), [account\nownership](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/ownership), and\n[transactions](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/transactions) work\nthe same way as they do in live mode, except they return testing data instead of\nreal account data.\n\nTest mode [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) are separate from live\nwebhooks. Learn about [testing your webhook\nintegrations](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks#test-webhook).\n\n[Testing different user authentication\nscenariosClient-side](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/testing#web-test-institutions)\nStripe provides a set of test institutions exercising different success and\nfailure scenarios, each represented as a bank in the list of featured\ninstitutions.\n\n#### Simulating successful authentication\n\n- **Test Institution**: Simulates the user successfully logging into their\ninstitution and contains a basic set of test accounts.\n- **Test OAuth Institution**: Contains the same test accounts as Test\nInstitution, but instead of authenticating directly with the modal, it opens an\nOAuth popup for authentication.\n- **Ownership Accounts**: Contains test accounts representing different\nownership states.\n- **Sandbox Bank (OAuth)**: Provides a test institution OAuth popup that allows\nyou to select accounts to link. Sandbox Bank is the most representative of\naccount linking for the majority of live mode institutions.\n- **Sandbox Bank (Non-OAuth)**: Provides a Stripe-hosted login form to simulate\ninstitutions that don’t support OAuth. Use the following test credentials to\nproceed:- The initial prompt asks for username and password. Entering any input\nvalue simulates a successful login.\n- In the password field or any subsequent field, enter `options` (selection from\na list), `mfa` (one-time passcode entry), `confirm_mfa` (one-time passcode\nconfirmation), or `security_question` (secret answer entry) to exercise further\nlogin prompts.\n- Entering `error` in any field ends the login session; `incorrect` gives you a\nchance to try again.\n- **Invalid Payment Accounts**: Contains test accounts that are unusable for ACH\npayments.\n\n#### Simulating failed authentication\n\n- **Down Bank (Scheduled)**: The institution’s login API is unavailable for a\nknown time period that the institution communicated to Stripe.\n- **Down Bank (Unscheduled)**: The institution’s login API is unavailable\nwithout any information about the downtime communicated to Stripe.\n- **Down Bank (Error)**: Stripe is experiencing an unknown error communicating\nwith the institution.\n\n#### Note\n\nWe recommend manually testing OAuth and non-OAuth institutions to make sure that\nboth UI flows work within the context your application. See [additional\ndocumentation](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/fundamentals#how-stripe-links-financial-accounts)\nabout the differences between OAuth and non-OAuth connections.\n\n## Links\n\n- [testing](https://docs.stripe.com/testing)\n- [use case guide](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/use-cases)\n- [authentication\nflow](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/fundamentals#authentication-flow)\n- [rate limited](https://docs.stripe.com/testing#rate-limits)\n- [Stripe.js](https://docs.stripe.com/js)\n- [balances](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/balances)\n- [account ownership](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/ownership)\n- [transactions](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/transactions)\n- [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks)\n- [testing your webhook\nintegrations](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks#test-webhook)\n- [additional\ndocumentation](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/fundamentals#how-stripe-links-financial-accounts)",
