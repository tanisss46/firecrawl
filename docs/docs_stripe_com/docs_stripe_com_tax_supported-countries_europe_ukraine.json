In Stripe,\nthese are referred to as “digital products.” To collect this tax on Stripe, you\nmust be a remote seller without a physical presence in the country.\n\n## When to register for tax collection\n\nSee [Thresholds](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/thresholds) to get insights\nabout your potential tax registration obligations in Ukraine.

Learn more about how the [monitoring tool\nworks](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/monitoring).\n\nRemote sellers providing digital goods or electronically supplied services\n(digital products) to individuals in Ukraine have a registration threshold of\n1,000,000 UAH for the previous calendar year. Sales to businesses don’t trigger\nany obligations to register.\n\n- **Threshold**: 1,000,000 UAH\n- **Included transactions**: Business-to-consumer (B2C) sales of digital goods\nor electronically supplied services (digital products).\n\n## Register to collect tax\n\nYou must be a remote seller with no physical presence in Ukraine to collect this\ntax on Stripe.\n\nFind more information on how to register for VAT in Ukraine on the [government\nwebsite](https://tax.gov.ua/en/baner/for-non-residents-providers-of-e-services/).\n\nAfter you’ve registered to collect tax in Ukraine, go to\n[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations?location=ua) to\nadd your registrations to Stripe in the Dashboard.

Stripe doesn’t calculate tax for products that don’t use a digital\nproduct tax code.\n\nView the list of supported [digital product tax\ncodes](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes?type=digital). To calculate taxes\nin Ukraine, make sure that you [assign a tax\ncode](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/products-prices-tax-codes-tax-behavior#tax-code-on-product)\nto each of your products.\n\nTo abide by sanctions laws and collect tax in Ukraine, Stripe needs additional\naddress information for customers located there. All customers with addresses in\nUkraine need to have a postal code on their address.\n\n### If you enabled Tax after July 23, 2024\n\nYou can add your registration in Ukraine and start collecting tax. Your\ncustomers in Ukraine will be asked for a country + postal code for the\ntransaction to go ahead.\n\n### If you started using Tax on or before July 23, 2024\n\nYou won’t be able to turn on tax collection for Ukraine yet. If you don’t use\nPayment Links or Checkout, some customer addresses in these locations might not\ncontain all the detail needed for tax calculation. Invoicing, Subscriptions, and\ncustom payment integrations won’t require the postal code automatically.\n\nWe’ve released a tool that enables you to export your customer addresses and see\nwhich addresses won’t have the required address information for tax calculation\nin Ukraine. Use the form below to request access. If you have existing\nsubscriptions, update any customer addresses to include a postal code. If you\ndon’t update this information, the [invoice won’t\nfinalize](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/customer-locations#finalizing-invoices-with-finalization-failures)\nand the payment won’t be collected.\n\n## Report and file your taxes\n\nStripe Tax has filing partners—Taxually, Marosa, and Hands-off Sales Tax\n(HOST)—to help automate your tax filing.
