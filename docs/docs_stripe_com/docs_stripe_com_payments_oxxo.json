  "content": "# OXXO payments\n\n## Learn how to accept payments with OXXO.\n\nOXXO is a Mexican chain of convenience stores with thousands of locations across\nLatin America and represents nearly 20% of online transactions in Mexico. OXXO\nallows customers to pay bills and online purchases in-store with cash.\n\nTo complete a transaction, customers receive a voucher that includes a reference\nnumber for the transaction. Customers then bring their voucher to an OXXO store\nto make a cash payment. You’ll receive payment confirmation by the next business\nday along with the settled funds.\n\nPayment method propertiesBusiness locationsProduct support- **Customer\nlocations**\n\nMexico\n- **Presentment currency**\n\nMXN\n- **Payment confirmation**\n\nCustomer-initiated\n- **Payment method family**\n\nCash-based payment method\n- **Recurring payments**\n\nNo\n- **Payout timing**\n\nStandard payout timing applies\n- **Connect support**\n\nYes\n- **Dispute support**\n\n[No](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/oxxo#disputed-payments)\n- **Manual capture support**\n\nNo\n- **Refunds / Partial refunds**\n\n[No / No](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/oxxo#refunds)\n\n## Payment flow\n\n!\n\nStep 1.

If you\nuse our front-end products, Stripe automatically determines the most relevant\npayment methods to display. Go to the [Stripe\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and enable\nOXXO. To get started with one of our hosted UIs, follow a quickstart:\n\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart): Our prebuilt, hosted\ncheckout page.\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart): Our drop-in UI\ncomponents.\n\n[Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links) also supports adding OXXO\nfrom the Dashboard.\n\nIf your integration requires manually listing payment methods, learn how to\n[manually configure OXXO as a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/oxxo/accept-a-payment).\n\nCheck out the OXXO [sample on\nGitHub](https://github.com/stripe-samples/accept-a-payment).\n\n## Disputes\n\nOXXO payments have a low risk of fraud or unrecognized payments because the\ncustomer must provide cash payment in person at an OXXO convenience store.\nCustomers can’t dispute OXXO payments.\n\n## Refunds\n\nOXXO payments can’t be refunded. Some businesses have created a separate process\nto credit their customers who reach out directly.\n\n## Amount limits\n\nThe amount for a single OXXO must be at least 10.00 MXN and no more than\n10,000.00 MXN.\n\n## Links\n\n- [No](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/oxxo#disputed-payments)\n- [No / No](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/oxxo#refunds)\n- [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods)\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart)\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart)\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n- [manually configure OXXO as a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/oxxo/accept-a-payment)\n- [sample on GitHub](https://github.com/stripe-samples/accept-a-payment)",
