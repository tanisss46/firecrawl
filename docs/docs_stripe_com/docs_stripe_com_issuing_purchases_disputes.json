Disputes\nare often used to correct fraudulent transactions or problems with the quality\nor delivery of the product.\n\nStripe offers a guided Dashboard process and an API to submit disputes and\nmonitor them through to resolution. This process typically takes between 30 and\n90 days. If you only manage occasional disputes, we recommend using the\nDashboard. If you manage a high volume of disputes, we recommend\nprogrammatically managing disputes using the API.\n\nIf you think a card has been compromised, [cancel and replace\nit](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/cards/replacements) using the Dashboard or\nthe API before continuing with the dispute process.\n\n## Considerations before initiating a dispute\n\n### Requirements for fraud disputes\n\nPlatforms must allow their connected accounts to submit fraudulent disputes\ndirectly to Stripe through a dashboard that you, as the Platform, make available\nusing our APIs or embedded components. You can’t restrict their ability to\nsubmit such disputes in any way. After fraud disputes are submitted, Stripe will\nreview them to determine if the cardholder needs to be reimbursed.\n\n### Non-fraud disputes\n\nMake sure that the cardholder has exhausted other means of resolving the issue.\nThey must attempt to return any products they received, cancel any ongoing\nservices, and seek a refund directly from the business. Collect documentation of\nthese attempts to use as evidence when filing the dispute.\n\n### Blocked dispute submissions\n\nStripe might block fraud dispute submission if the transaction doesn’t qualify\nfor fraud protection under local regulations and the account holder has no\ndispute rights according to network rules.\n\n#### For platforms\n\nIf you’re obligated to submit a dispute and you submit it, you’ve fulfilled your\nobligation, regardless of if Stripe blocks the submission.\n\nCard networks might consider a dispute invalid for the following reasons (among\nothers):\n\n- The transaction is a refund and not a\n[capture](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/purchases/transactions).\n- The transaction is a mobile push payment transaction.\n- More than 110 days have passed since the business captured the transaction.-\nHowever, if you plan to file an Authorization dispute, this deadline is\nshorter:- For Visa, the transaction was captured more than 65 days ago.\n- For Mastercard, the transaction was captured more than 80 days ago.\n\nIn the Dashboard, the dispute transaction button is only enabled for eligible\ntransactions. In the API, attempting to dispute an ineligible transaction\nresults in an error.\n\n## Lifecycle\n\n**Unsubmitted**\n\n**Expired**\n\n**Submitted** (the dispute is sent to the card network)\n\n**Lost**\n\nThe business receives the dispute\n\nThe business refutes with counter-evidence\n\nStripe refutes the business’s evidence\n\nThe business declines, moves toarbitration with card network\n\nThe card network makes a final ruling\n\n**Won**\n\nThe business accepts liabilityor doesn’t respond\n\nEvidence in favor ofacquiring business\n\n110 daysSubmitRejected≤ 30 days≤ 30 days≤ 30 days≤ 30 days≤ 30 days≤ 30\ndaysLifecycle of an Issuing dispute\n#### Business terminology\n\nIn the above diagram, *business* refers to the *acquiring business*, the\nbusiness receiving the payment.\n\nNewly-created disputes begin in an `unsubmitted` status. At this point, you can\nupdate their evidence and metadata. After you’ve added all the required\nevidence, you can then submit the dispute. If you don’t submit a dispute within\n110 days of the transaction clearing, its status becomes `expired`.\n\nStripe and card networks process disputes that have a status of `submitted`. As\nsuch, you can’t update dispute evidence, but you can still update their\n`metadata`. Submitted disputes enter into a multi-step process defined by card\nnetworks and participating banks. After a dispute is resolved, Stripe\ntransitions it to either the terminal `won` or `lost` status.\n\n## Creation\n\nFill out the **Dispute Amount** field to indicate the disputed amount (full or\npartial). The field’s initial value is the transaction amount. Submissions that\nhave empty **Dispute Amount** fields create disputes with the full transaction\namount.\n\n!\n\nDispute Amount field on the Issuing dispute creation page\n\nDashboardAPI - Issuing-onlyAPI - Issuing with Treasury\nClick **Dispute transaction** when viewing an eligible transaction. You’ll be\nredirected to a form which requests different information based on the dispute\nreason and product type (merchandise, services or digital goods). A dispute is\ncreated the first time you click **Save**. If you click **Submit** without\nsaving, we create a dispute before submitting it.\n\nAfter you submit a dispute, you can’t modify the information or resubmit the\ndispute.\n\n## Update\n\nDashboardAPI\nUse the **Unsubmitted** tab to access disputes that are in progress. The\n**Submit before** date indicates when the dispute expires.\n\n!\n\nFrom the individual dispute page, click **Edit submission** to access the form\nwhere you can update the evidence.\n\n## Submission\n\nDashboardAPI\nThe **Submit** button on the evidence form is enabled when all required evidence\nis present.\n\n#### Caution\n\nReview the evidence thoroughly before you submit, because you can’t modify\ndispute information after submitting the dispute.\n\n## Resolution\n\nDashboardAPI\nStripe updates a dispute’s status when we hear back from the card network.\n\nIf you win the dispute, its status changes to `won` and we credit your Issuing\nbalance in the form of an `issuing_dispute` [balance\ntransaction](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/balance-transaction-types#issuing_related).\nThis balance transaction is accessible in the Dashboard under [All\ntransactions](https://dashboard.stripe.com/balance) and on the bottom of the\ndispute detail page.\n\n#### Note\n\nIf you make a transaction in a currency other than your account’s default\ncurrency (for example, a GBP transaction that your USD card pays), Stripe\nrefunds the won dispute in the transaction’s original currency.\n\nIf you lose the dispute, the dispute’s status changes to `lost` and we don’t\ncredit any amount to your Issuing balance.\n\n!\n\nViewing a dispute’s balance transactions in the Dashboard.\n\nStripe processes disputes according to card network rules. These rules are\nupdated twice a year. You can review the latest rules on each network’s website:\n\n- **Visa**: [Visa Core Rules and Visa Product and Service\nRules](https://usa.visa.com/dam/VCOM/download/about-visa/visa-rules-public.pdf)\n- **Mastercard**: [Mastercard\nRules](https://www.mastercard.us/en-us/business/overview/support/rules.html)-\nThe [Mastercard\nChargeback](https://www.mastercard.us/content/dam/public/mastercardcom/na/global-site/documents/chargeback-guide.pdf)\nguide is especially useful for understanding Mastercard’s dispute rules.\n\n## Testing\n\nDashboardAPI\nStripe’s test mode allows you to test dispute logic without any live mode\neffects. For example, we send webhook events, create [balance\ntransactions](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/balance-transaction-types), and\nupdate your test mode Issuing balance without moving any funds or changing any\nbalances in live mode.\n\nSimilar to live mode, a test mode dispute transitions to `expired` 110 days\nafter the transaction is captured.\n\nWhen submitting a test mode dispute through the Dashboard, you can choose the\ndispute’s outcome. Selecting **Won** automatically changes the dispute’s\n`explanation` field to `winning_evidence`, and selecting **Lost** automatically\nchanges the dispute’s **explanation** field to `losing_evidence`.\n\n!\n\n## Webhooks\n\nTo be notified of changes to your disputes, you can listen for Issuing dispute\n[webhook events](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks). All Issuing dispute events\ncontain the updated\n[Dispute](https://docs.stripe.com/api/#issuing_dispute_object) object.\n\nWebhook eventsTrigger`issuing_dispute.created`Dispute\ncreated.`issuing_dispute.updated`Dispute\nupdated.`issuing_dispute.submitted`Dispute\nsubmitted.`issuing_dispute.funds_reinstated`Funds transferred to your Issuing\nbalance (usually associated with `won` dispute\nstatus).`issuing_dispute.funds_rescinded`Funds deducted from your Issuing\nbalance (usually associated with a provisional credit\nclawback).`issuing_dispute.closed`Dispute transitioned into a `won`, `lost`, or\n`expired` status.\n## Dispute reasons and evidence\n\nYou must submit supporting documentation with a dispute. The quality of this\ndocumentation directly influences your chances of winning and the strongest\ndisputes have clear, descriptive documentation. All relevant information or\ndocumentation must be included when you first submit the dispute.\n\nThe type of documentation required depends on the reason for the dispute.\nBecause of this, it’s important to choose the correct reason.\n\nDisputes can be submitted with one of these reasons:\n\n- **Canceled**: The cardholder canceled or returned merchandise or canceled\nservices, and the business didn’t process a credit or void a transaction\nreceipt.\n- **Duplicate**: Covers processing error dispute types, including duplicate\ntransaction, incorrect amount, paid by other means, and so on.\n- **Fraudulent**: The cardholder’s details were compromised and the transaction\nwasn’t authorized by them.\n- **Merchandise not as described**: The cardholder received the merchandise, but\nit didn’t match what was presented at time of purchase, or it was damaged or\ndefective.\n- **Not received**: The cardholder participated in the transaction but didn’t\nreceive the merchandise or service.\n- **No valid authorization**: (API only) The business processed a transaction\nwithout a valid authorization.\n- **Service not as described**: The cardholder received the service, but it\ndidn’t match what was presented at time of purchase.\n- **Other**: A dispute scenario that doesn’t clearly qualify as any other\ndispute reason. Authorization disputes might have this reason (for example, if\nfiled through the Dashboard).\n\nIn the Dashboard, `Merchandise not as described` and `Service not as described`\nare consolidated under `Not as described`.\n\nEach reason requires a different set of evidence:\n\nFraudulentNo valid authorizationNot receivedDuplicateMerchandise not as\ndescribedService not as describedCanceledOtherEvidence DescriptionExplanationA\ndescription of the transaction and why the cardholder is disputing it. You can\nalso use this field to provide an additional explanation that’s not captured\nanywhere else. It’s important for the cardholder to verify that they didn’t\nparticipate in the transaction, and that the transaction wasn’t made by someone\nknown to the cardholder.Additional documentationRelevant documents such as card\nstatements or return shipping tracking. The files must be in PDF or JPEG format.\nBefore submitting the dispute, make sure that all text and images are clear and\nlarge enough to be legible in a black-and-white fax transmission. Encouraging\ncardholders to keep their billing address up to date is a key component in the\nassessment of fraudulent disputes.\n### Fraud disputes\n\nYou can dispute a transaction for fraud if the cardholder’s card details were\ncompromised and they didn’t authorize the transaction.\n\nBefore filing a dispute:\n\n- Confirm with the cardholder that they didn’t make the transaction in error,\nand that it wasn’t made by someone known to them. Transactions made by a friend\nor family member, for example, don’t constitute fraud for dispute purposes.\n- Cancel the affected card.\n\nIn certain situations, you can lose fraud dispute rights for a transaction:\n\n- **For card-present transactions**: A card network might automatically reject a\nfraud dispute because liability defaults to the issuer.\n- **For card-not-present transactions**: A card network might automatically\nreject a fraud dispute if the cardholder was authenticated during the\ntransaction. That often happens when [3D\nSecure](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure) was requested or a secured\npayment method like Apple Pay was used.\n\n### Authorization disputes\n\nEach time an acquiring business processes a transaction, they must first request\nan authorization from the issuer. If a business captures a payment without a\nvalid authorization, you can dispute the transaction. The reason you should\nchoose depends on the method used to submit the dispute:\n\n- **Filing a dispute through the API**: File the dispute under the\n`no_valid_authorization` reason.\n- **Filing a dispute through the Dashboard**: File the dispute under the `other`\nreason and specify in the `explanation` field that the business didn’t get a\nvalid authorization.\n\nAuthorization disputes are distinct from fraud disputes:\n\n- File a fraud dispute when the cardholder didn’t participate in the\ntransaction. For example, a thief stole their card and used it.\n- File an authorization dispute when the business didn’t have a valid\nauthorization for the transaction. For example, they captured a payment 2 days\nafter its authorization expired.\n\nA common reason for an authorization dispute is an overcapture. An overcapture\noccurs when the captured amount exceeds the authorized amount. When you submit\nan authorization dispute for an overcapture, you must adjust the dispute amount\nto include only the amount that exceeded the authorization.\n\n#### Note\n\nSome Merchant Category Codes (MCCs) allow overcaptures of certain amounts or\ndisallow authorization disputes. For details, refer to the current card network\nrules for your region.\n\nA card network can reject an authorization dispute if the transaction had a\nvalid authorization. In the case of an overcapture, it can reject the dispute if\nthe disputed amount doesn’t take into account the allowed overcapture amount for\nthe associated MCC.\n\n## Withdrawing\n\nStripe can only withdraw a dispute within 1 day of its submission to the card\nnetwork. If you want to withdraw a dispute, contact [Stripe\nSupport](https://support.stripe.com/contact) immediately.\n\n## Liability for fraud (platforms in the USA)\n\nMost aspects of Regulation Z don’t apply to business-purpose cards, but\nRegulation Z does protect users of business-purpose cards from fraud and other\ntypes of “unauthorized card use,\" which means the use of a charge card by a\nperson who doesn’t have the authority to use it. In most cases, an accountholder\ncan’t be held responsible for unauthorized use of cards linked to their account\nunless a reasonable investigation into the fraud is conducted. However, if the\naccount holder has 10 or more employee authorized users, they might not qualify\nfor this protection.\n\nWhen one of your users disputes a transaction because the user believes it was\nunauthorized, Stripe sends the dispute to the card network for adjudication (as\nwith any other type of disputed transaction). Stripe or the card network\ndetermines who must pay for the fraud: you or the business.\n\nIf Stripe or the card network determines the business is liable for the fraud,\nthen neither you nor your user are responsible for the disputed transactions.\n\nIf Stripe or the card network determines that you’re liable for the fraud, then\nyou might be required to pay for the disputed transaction. Stripe performs a\nreasonable investigation into the dispute to determine whether fraud actually\noccurred or whether the user doesn’t qualify for protection under Regulation Z.\nIf the investigation uncovers that unauthorized card use actually occurred and\nthat the user qualifies for protection, then you remain liable for the\nunauthorized transactions. Alternatively, if the investigation uncovers that\nunauthorized card use didn’t occur or that the user doesn’t qualify for\nprotection, then we hold the accountholder responsible for the disputed charges.\n\n## Emailing connect accounts\n\nIssuing platforms must send regulated notice emails to connected accounts when a\ndispute is submitted, and again when a dispute is won or lost. [Learn more about\nregulated\nnotices](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/compliance-us/issuing-regulated-customer-notices).\n\n## Use with Stripe Treasury\n\nDisputes of `ReceivedDebits` on `FinancialAccounts` have a corresponding\n[DebitReversal](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/debit_reversals) after the\ndispute is submitted.\n\n## Links\n\n- [cancel and replace it](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/cards/replacements)\n- [capture](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/purchases/transactions)\n- [balance\ntransaction](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/balance-transaction-types#issuing_related)\n- [All transactions](https://dashboard.stripe.com/balance)\n- [Visa Core Rules and Visa Product and Service\nRules](https://usa.visa.com/dam/VCOM/download/about-visa/visa-rules-public.pdf)\n- [Mastercard\nRules](https://www.mastercard.us/en-us/business/overview/support/rules.html)\n- [Mastercard\nChargeback](https://www.mastercard.us/content/dam/public/mastercardcom/na/global-site/documents/chargeback-guide.pdf)\n- [balance\ntransactions](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/balance-transaction-types)\n- [webhook events](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks)\n- [Dispute](https://docs.stripe.com/api/#issuing_dispute_object)\n- [3D Secure](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure)\n- [Stripe Support](https://support.stripe.com/contact)\n- [Learn more about regulated\nnotices](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/compliance-us/issuing-regulated-customer-notices)\n- [DebitReversal](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/debit_reversals)",
