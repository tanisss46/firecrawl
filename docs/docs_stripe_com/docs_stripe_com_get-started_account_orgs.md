Building an organization streamlines operations and account management with a
centralized view in the Stripe Dashboard to manage all lines of business or
subsidiaries across multiple Stripe accounts. You can use Organizations to:

- Gain a view of your entire business with global customer search
- Download unified reports across currencies
- Streamline team management and SSO from a centralized location
- Perform custom SQL queries with
[Sigma](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data/access-data-in-dashboard) across all
accounts

Adding your accounts to an organization doesnâ€™t require any changes to your
payment integration or customer payment flow.
