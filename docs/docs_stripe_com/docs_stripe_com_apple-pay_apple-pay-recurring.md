# Manage recurring payments on Apple Pay

## Improve authorization rates for recurring Apple Pay transactions.

## Checkout and Elements best practices

[Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout) and
[Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements) automatically apply the
best practices recommended in this guide.

## How recurring Apple Pay payments work

To make recurring payments, some businesses need to save the Apple Pay payment
method on file when a user is on-session then make the recurring payments later
when the user is off-session. The first on-session payment is often called a
customer initiated transaction (CIT), and the later recurring payments are often
called merchant initiated transactions (MIT). Two examples of recurring payments
(or MIT) are:

- Subscriptions where users get billed on a fixed frequency.
- Recurring off-session payments where the billing frequency is inconsistent, or
where customers can vary the frequency.

When users interact with the Apple Pay payment sheet, to keep the PAN (the
original card number) private, Apple Pay processes a card PAN and generates a
Device Primary Account Number (DPAN) or [Merchant
Token](https://developer.apple.com/apple-pay/merchant-tokens/) (MPAN) depending
on the device OS version and integration. DPANs are tied to the specific Apple
device, and can be unintentionally deactivated if a user switches to a new
device (for example, an iPhone or an iPad) and adds the same card on it. MPAN is
the newly introduced more reliable option for recurring payments. MPANs are not
deactivated when users switch their devices, and comes with better visibility
and lifecycle management features.

Beyond these differences, MPAN and DPAN behave similarly.

## Expired cryptogram can cause authorization failures

When a DPAN (or an MPAN) generates, it also comes with an expiring one-time use
cryptogram. Stripe needs to conduct the CIT and send both the DPAN (or MPAN) and
cryptogram to the authorization network as soon as possible before the
cryptogram expires. This expiration mechanism adds a layer of security to Apple
Pay Wallets, but failing to trigger the CIT in time is often the root cause of
authorization failures.

When the first CIT using the cryptogram fails, subsequent MITs using the same
[Card](https://docs.stripe.com/api/cards/object) will likely also fail because
they’re internally linked to the CIT. These recurring payment failures lead to
the low authorization success rate.

## Improve authorization for your API integration

To implement recurring Apple Pay transactions using the API:

- Save the DPAN (or MPAN) and cryptogram in a `Card`.
- Initiate a CIT to consume the cryptogram before its expiration. Send a 0 USD
validation or a charge transaction to the authorization network, and keep a
record of the returned network transaction.
- Reuse the payment method for future off-session MITs. Stripe sends the DPAN
(or MPAN) and the network transaction ID of the original CIT to the
authorization network to improve authorization rate.

Consume cryptograms as soon as they’re created using the following
recommendations.

### Use subscriptions for free trials

When a customer signs up for a free trial, they’re not charged until the free
trial period ends. To make sure you consume the DPAN (or MPAN) cryptogram before
it expires, use [Stripe Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/subscriptions).
The Subscription creates a
[SetupIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents) that generates a 0 USD
validation with the authorization network. This acts as the CIT, consuming the
cryptogram immediately, rather than delaying the first transaction until after
the free trial, when the cryptogram has expired.

You can also [create a
SetupIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents/create) directly to save
the [Apple Pay
PaymentMethod](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object#payment_method_object-card-wallet-apple_pay)
for future usage. SetupIntent confirmation initiates the same CIT 0 USD
validation to consume the cryptogram. Then you can use the authorized [Apple Pay
PaymentMethod](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object#payment_method_object-card-wallet-apple_pay)
to create a Subscription later.

### Create a SetupIntent for Tokens API integrations Legacy

We discourage using the legacy Tokens and Charges APIs for recurring Apple Pay
payments. It causes the cryptogram expiration authorization failure described in
this document. The Tokens API doesn’t trigger the authorization request in time
to consume the cryptogram. Additionally, the Charges API doesn’t support the
following features, many of which are required for credit card compliance:

- Merchants in India
- Bank requests for card authentication
- Strong Customer Authentication

**For these reasons, we recommend migrating to the PaymentIntents and the
SetupIntents APIs.**

If you’re using the legacy [Tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens) to
create an Apple Pay payment token and then calling
[Charges](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges) later to charge the user when the
trial ends, you can improve your authorization rate following these steps.

- Create a Payment Method immediately after you create the token.
```
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_method \
 -u sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2: \
 -d "type"="card" \
 -d "card[token]"="tok_123"
```
- Immediately create a [SetupIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents)
with the new PaymentMethod to perform a 0 USD validation transaction.

Completing these two steps performs the CIT and sends the cryptogram to the
network for authorization before it expires. If you’re using Stripe.js, you can
combine these steps by calling [stripe.confirmCardSetup with
token](https://docs.stripe.com/js/setup_intents/confirm_card_setup#stripe_confirm_card_setup-token).

You can now make off-session MIT payments using the saved Apple Pay payment
method. If you’re using PaymentIntents, set
[off_session=true](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/confirm#confirm_payment_intent-off_session)
to indicate that the customer isn’t in your checkout flow.

### Set up off-session payments

If you’re setting up deferred off-session Apple Pay payments and aiming to
collect payment information for future off-session uses, such as a hotel
reservation, see Apple Pay’s [list of supported payment
types](https://developer.apple.com/apple-pay/planning/).

Apple Pay supports
[usage=off_session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents/object#setup_intent_object-usage)
payments using DPANs (or MPANs) when the customer is outside of the checkout
flow. However, they have a slightly higher risk because they don’t get a
liability shift from the network and might get lower authorization rates than
average.

Apple Pay terms forbid using a saved payment method for
[usage=on_session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents/object#setup_intent_object-usage)
payments. If the customer is in the flow, you’re required to have them authorize
and generate a new cryptogram for that transaction.

Apple Pay supports incremental authorizations only when you increase the amount
of an authorized charge before capturing it.

You can initiate a CIT for your Tokens API integration in either of the
following ways:

- [Create a SetupIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents/create) as
described in the free trial scenario to initiate a 0 USD validation that creates
a reusable DPAN (or MPAN) based payment method for off-session payments.
- Create a PaymentIntent with
[setup_future_usage=off_session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-setup_future_usage).

You can now make off-session MIT payments using the saved payment method. If
you’re using PaymentIntents, set
[off_session=true](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/confirm#confirm_payment_intent-off_session)
to indicate that the customer isn’t in your checkout flow.
