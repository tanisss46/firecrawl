If you’re a\nfirst-time user, Stripe automatically enables cards and other payment methods.\nYou can view these payment methods and turn them on or off in the [Invoice\ndefault payment methods\nconfiguration](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/invoice).\n\nIn some situations, there might be restrictions that prevent payment methods\nfrom being used for an invoice. For example, a payment method might only operate\nin one currency, or have limitations on the amount that can be paid. Stripe\ndoesn’t automatically select a payment method when these limitations prevent it\nfrom being used. To learn more, see [Payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/payment-methods#supported).\n\n![Choose additional payment\nmethods](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/supported-payment-methods.949a2d41b8da98f93ad94c95c986e75c.png)\n\nChoose additional payment methods\n\n[How to get paid](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/no-code-guide#get-paid)\nYou can [create and send](https://dashboard.stripe.com/invoices/create) an\ninvoice from the Dashboard.
