Otherwise, choose **Events on your account**.\n- Select the [event types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types) that you\nwant to send to the destination, then click **Continue**.\n- Select **Webhook** to send events to an HTTPS endpoint.\n- Provide the **Endpoint URL** for Stripe to send webhooks to and an optional\ndescription for the endpoint.\n- Click **Create destination** to create your webhook endpoint.\n\n![Register a new webhook endpoint in the Webhooks\ntab](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/create-webhook-endpoint.92271ebcb6d3c1f936baaeeda36feafc.png)\n\n## Configure an existing event destination\n\nYou can update or delete existing event destinations in the\n[Webhooks](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks) tab. You can also temporarily\ndisable a destination. Stripe won’t attempt to resend any events generated while\nthe destination is disabled. Additionally, you can [manage event\ndestinations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/v2/core/event_destinations)\nprogrammatically.\n\n## View event deliveries\n\nTo view event deliveries:\n\n- Open the [Webhooks](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks) tab in Workbench.\n- Select the event destination.\n- Click the **Event deliveries** tab.\n\nThe **Event deliveries** tab provides a list of events and whether they’re\nDelivered, Pending, or Failed. Click an event to view the **Delivery attempts**,\nwhich includes the HTTP status code of previous delivery attempts and the time\nof pending future deliveries.\n\n![View event delivery attempts on a webhook endpoint's Event deliveries\ntab](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/view-event-deliveries.375483a863ab143a0e92f01fa01c14b0.png)\n\nView event delivery attempts on a webhook endpoint’s **Event deliveries** tab.\n\n## Retry sending an event\n\nIn live mode, Stripe attempts to deliver a given event to your webhook endpoint\nfor up to 3 days with an exponential back off. In the **Event deliveries**\nsection of your webhook endpoint listed on Workbench, you can view when the next\nretry will occur.\n\nIn test mode, Stripe retries three times over a few hours. You can manually\nretry transmitting individual events to your webhook endpoint after this time\nusing the Workbench **Webhooks** tab by navigating to the **Event deliveries**\nlisted for your desired endpoint. You can also [query for missed\nevents](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/list) to reconcile the data over any\ntime period.\n\n![Retry sending events using a webhook endpoint's Event deliveries\ntab](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/retry-failed-event-deliveries.225753ebf217cd1e9d0798f0c6f0a198.png)\n\nRetry sending events using a webhook endpoint’s **Event deliveries** tab.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Interactive webhook endpoint\nbuilder](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks/quickstart)\n\n## Links\n\n- [events guide](https://docs.stripe.com/event-destinations)\n- [Webhooks](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)\n- [events object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events)\n- [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)\n- [event types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types)\n- [manage event\ndestinations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/v2/core/event_destinations)\n- [Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli)\n- [listen for events](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks#test-webhook)\n- [query for missed events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/list)\n- [Interactive webhook endpoint\nbuilder](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks/quickstart)",
