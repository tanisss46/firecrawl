  "content": "# Customize invoices\n\n## Learn how to customize the content and branding of your invoices.\n\nYou can customize the content of an\n[invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices) using the API, invoice, and\nsubscription editors; [Invoice\nTemplates](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/invoice-rendering-template); or\nAccount [Invoice\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/invoice). You can also\nset a customer preferred language and include public information in your\n[account\ndetails](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/account/?support_details=true).\nBecause you know more about your customers and your business than Stripe does,\nmake sure your invoices include all of the required information. Your invoices\nmust be accurate, charge the appropriate tax, and comply with all applicable\nlaws and regulations in your region.\n\n![Invoice\nsettings](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/invoice-settings-screenshot.6174ac7fd03e2bbe688cddf0a22d6ee2.png)\n\nInvoice settings\n\n## Branding\n\nStripe allows you to customize (as well as preview) email receipts, hosted\ninvoices, invoice PDFs, and so on, in your [Branding\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/branding).\n\nIcons and logos must be in JPG or PNG format, less than 512kb in size, and equal\nto or greater than 128px by 128px.\n\n- **Icon**—A square, digital-friendly icon or logo.\n- **Logo**—A non-square logo to override some uses of the icon.\n- **Brand color**—Used on receipts, invoices, and the customer portal.\n- **Accent color**—Used as a background on emails and pages.\n\n### Apply brand settings\n\nBrand settings apply to your whole account and take effect in many places.\n\nSettingEmailsCheckout & Payment LinksCustomer portalHosted Invoice PageInvoice\nPDFsIconYesYesYesYesYesLogoNoNoYesBrand colorYesYesYesAccent colorYes\n(background color)YesYes\n## Invoice numbering\n\nStripe automatically generates invoice numbers to help track and reconcile\ninvoices. Invoice numbers have a prefix and suffix, such as `586A2E-0139` or\n`MYSHOP-1203`. (​​The full invoice number is always unique across your account\nin both schemes.) ​​Stripe supports two invoice numbering schemes:\n\n- ​​**Sequentially for each customer (customer-level)**—Uses a unique prefix for\neach customer and assigns invoice numbers sequentially for a given customer.\n- ​​**Sequentially across your account (account-level)**—Uses the same prefix\nfor every customer and assigns invoice numbers sequentially across your entire\naccount.\n\nStripe chooses a default behavior based on the country your Stripe account is\nbased in. [European\nUnion](https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/business/vat/eu-vat-rules-topic/vat-invoicing-rules_en)\nmember countries and the [United\nKingdom](https://www.gov.uk/invoicing-and-taking-payment-from-customers/invoices-what-they-must-include)\ntypically require account level sequencing. All other countries default to\ncustomer level sequencing because it doesn’t expose the total number of\ninvoices. When switching between schemes or updating prefixes, only future\ninvoices use the new settings. This doesn’t impact existing invoices.\n\n#### Caution\n\nInvoice requirements vary by jurisdiction. Consult with a professional for\nguidance on your specific use case. You’re responsible for verifying that the\ninvoices you issue meet local tax requirements.\n\n### Customer level prefixes\n\nWhen you configure an invoice to use customer-level numbering, each invoice\nnumber begins with the customer’s unique invoice prefix.\n\nFor example, if one of your customers is a business named Typographic, you might\nset the prefix to `TYPGRA`. The first invoice number for Typographic would be\n`TYPGRA-0001`, the second would be `TYPGRA-0002` and so on.\n\n​​You can override prefixes so that you can trace invoices back to your\ncustomers. You can set prefixes on the [Customers\npage](https://dashboard.stripe.com/customers) in the Dashboard or with the API\nby using the\n[invoice_prefix](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/create#create_customer-invoice_prefix)\nparameter. Prefixes have to be between 3 and 12 characters and they can’t match\nany other customer prefix, including prefixes that are no longer in use.\n\n### Account level prefixes\n\nWhen you configure an invoice to use account-level numbering, each invoice\nnumber starts with a common prefix and has a sequential number.\n\nFor example, if your business is named Rocket Rides, you might set the prefix to\n`RKTRIDE`. Your first invoice would be `RKTRIDE-0001`, a second invoice to a\ndifferent customer would be `RKTRIDE-0002`, another invoice to the first\ncustomer would be `RKTRIDE-0003`, and so on.\n\nStripe automatically assigns the account-wide prefix, but you can override it to\nmake it clearer that these invoices come from you. If you want to modify the\nprefix for your account, you can change it in [Invoice\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/invoice). This requires\nthat your account’s default API version is at least\n[2020-03-02](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#2020-03-02). Prefixes have to be\nbetween 3 and 12 characters and they can’t match any customer prefix, including\nprefixes that are no longer in use.\n\n#### Caution\n\n​​You can’t use a customer prefix as an account prefix. This includes prefixes\nthat are no longer in use.\n\n### Connect account prefixes\n\nFor connected accounts that aren’t currently managed with the `on_behalf_of`\nparameter, sequential invoice numbering—at the customer and merchant level—will\nbegin at `0001` if the parameter is used in the future.\n\n### Set the next invoice number\n\nBy default, invoice numbers start at `0001`. If you’d like to use a different\nstarting invoice number, however, you can change it. For example, some\nusers—when migrating existing customers to Stripe Invoicing—want their invoice\nnumbers to continue where their old system left off. If the user left off at\ninvoice number `123` in their old system, Stripe allows them to resume the\ninvoice number at `124`.\n\n​​Set the number on the **Customer details** page or with the API by using the\n[next_invoice_sequence](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/create#create_customer-next_invoice_sequence)\nparameter. If you’re using account-level prefixes, set the next invoice number\nin the **Next invoice sequence** field in [Invoice\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/invoice).\n\nYou can only set the next invoice number to numbers greater than any numbers\nused on an invoice. The maximum allowed invoice number is 1,000,000,000\nregardless of how you set it. Use the lowest value possible so that you don’t\nreach this limit.\n\n## Invoice fields\n\nLearn more about the different Invoice fields, including memo, footer, and\ncustom fields. To set the same value on these fields for groups of customers,\nyou can use [Invoice\nTemplates](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/invoice-rendering-template).\n\n### Default memo\n\nA memo is included in invoice PDFs, invoice emails, and the [Hosted Invoice\nPage](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/hosted-invoice-page). Memos are commonly\nused as a notes section, thanking the invoiced customer for their business, or\ngiving more context around the invoice (such as a note from the salesperson who\ntalked to the customer).\n\nYou can set a default memo field for your account in [Invoice\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/invoice). ​​Any new\ninvoices use this value. You can also specify the memo on [Invoice\nTemplates](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/invoice-rendering-template), which\nreplaces the default memo on invoices using a template.\n\nYou can specify a different memo for a particular invoice when you create or\nupdate it in the Dashboard. You can also specify a memo using the API by calling\n[update\ninvoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update#update_invoice-description)\nand including the `description` parameter.\n\n### Default footer\n\n​​Invoice PDFs can include an optional footer text block. The footer field is\noften used for contractual or legally required text. A common use case is\ndisplaying legally required company registration information, such as a UK\nCompanies House registration number.\n\nLike the memo field, you can set the default footer value in [Invoice\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/invoice) or specify\nfooters on [Invoice\nTemplates](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/invoice-rendering-template). ​​You\ncan specify a different footer for a particular draft invoice when you create or\nupdate it in the Dashboard, or with the API by calling [update\nInvoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update#update_invoice-footer). If\nan invoice has been\n[finalized](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/workflow-transitions#finalized),\nyou can’t update its footer field.\n\n### Default item prices\n\nYou can issue invoices with line item prices that exclude inclusive tax.\nTax-exclusive prices are only shown in the invoice PDF. That means, when using\ninclusive tax, the Hosted Invoice Page and invoice emails show tax-inclusive\nprices. You can define the settings for net prices in the Dashboard or API.\n\n- **Include inclusive tax**—The invoice PDF displays line item prices including\nthe inclusive tax. (This is the default.)\n- **Exclude tax**—The invoice PDF displays line item prices excluding tax.\n\n#### Order precedence\n\nIf you set a default for line item prices at the customer level, it takes\nprecedence over account-level settings.\n\n### Custom fields\n\nAdd custom fields to enhance your invoice PDF documents and help you comply with\nyour business practice and tax reporting obligations. Custom fields allow you to\nprovide up to four key-value pairs ​​that display in the invoice header. You can\nset up to four custom field key-value pairs in the [Invoice\nEditor](https://dashboard.stripe.com/invoices/create), with the [Invoices\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create#create_invoice-custom_fields),\nor with [Invoice\nTemplates](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/invoice-rendering-template).\n\nSome common uses for custom fields are:\n\n- Purchase Order (PO) numbers\n- Contractor numbers\n- Tax compliance\n\n#### Custom field inheritance\n\nYou can set custom invoice fields on the\n[Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-invoice_settings-custom_fields)\nobject. Any custom fields you set at the customer level apply to all of the\ndraft invoices you generate for that customer. You can always modify these\ninherited custom fields while the invoice is still a draft. After the invoice\nfinalizes, you can’t update the custom fields.\n\n## PDF page size\n\nYou can set the page size for your invoice PDF, including finalized invoices, to\nA4 (8.27 x 11.69 inches) or Letter (8.5 x 11 inches).\n\nDashboardAPI\nTo set the page size using the Dashboard, go to the [Invoice\nEditor](https://dashboard.stripe.com/invoices/create), and find the **Advanced\noptions** section. Then, in the **PDF page size** sub-section, select **A4** or\n**Letter**.\n\n**Advanced options** on the Invoice Editor\n\n## Group line items\n\nTo help your customers better understand your invoices (including PDFs, Hosted\nInvoice Page, and invoice emails), categorize, and display invoice line items\nunder different groups. You can also hide groups of line items. If some line\nitems are excessively detailed, you can configure it so that only their\ngroup-level subtotal is visible to your customers.\n\n## Default payment terms\n\nUnder **Default payment terms** in [Invoice\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/invoice), you can select\nwhen the payment is due after you send the invoice. You can also choose whether\nto include a Stripe-hosted link to an invoice payment page in the invoice email.\nCustomers can visit this link to pay, download, and see the status of their\ninvoice. Lastly, you can manage your accepted payment methods in this section.\n\n## Customer preferred languages\n\nWhen you create a customer, use the **Language** dropdown to add their preferred\nlanguage. (You can also add or edit a customer’s preferred language in the\n**Customer details** page or when creating an invoice.) Stripe uses the chosen\nlanguage to localize invoice emails and PDFs, receipt emails and PDFs, as well\nas credit note PDFs. To update the language through the API, use the\n[preferred_locales](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-preferred_locales)\nfield.\n\nStripe Invoicing supports the following languages:\n\n- Bulgarian\n- Chinese (Hong Kong)\n- Chinese (Simplified)\n- Chinese (Taiwan)\n- Croatian\n- Czech\n- Danish\n- Dutch\n- (United Kingdom)\n- (United States)\n- Estonian\n- Filipino\n- Finnish\n- French (Canada)\n- French (France)\n- German\n- Greek\n- Hungarian\n- Indonesian\n- Italian\n- Japanese\n- Korean\n- Latvian\n- Lithuanian\n- Malay (Malaysia)\n- Malayalam\n- Maltese\n- Norwegian\n- Polish\n- Portuguese (Brazil)\n- Portuguese (Portugal)\n- Romanian\n- Russian\n- Slovak\n- Slovenian\n- Spanish (Latin America)\n- Spanish (Spain)\n- Swedish\n- Thai\n- Turkish\n- Vietnamese\n\n## Billing and shipping addresses\n\nStripe uses a customer’s\n[address](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-address)\nas the billing address on the invoice PDF. You can add or edit a customer’s\naddress on the **Customer details** page. If you don’t set the `address` field,\nStripe renders the shipping address as the billing address on the PDF.\n\nTo render shipping details on the Invoice PDF, set the\n[shipping_details](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create#create_invoice-shipping_details)\nfield. If you don’t set the `shipping_details` field, Stripe renders the\nshipping address from the customer’s\n[shipping](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-shipping)\nfield on the PDF.\n\n## Public support information\n\nInvoices include any public information that you specified under [Public\nbusiness information](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public), such as\nyour support email address or business website. Using these settings, you can\nalso choose to include a support phone number in customer-facing documents—like\ninvoice PDFs and emails—or default to your business address.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Use the Dashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/dashboard)\n- [Hosted Invoice Page](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/hosted-invoice-page)\n- [Send customer emails](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/send-email)\n\n## Links\n\n- [invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n- [Invoice\nTemplates](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/invoice-rendering-template)\n- [Invoice settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/invoice)\n- [account\ndetails](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/account/?support_details=true)\n- [Branding settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/branding)\n- [European\nUnion](https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/business/vat/eu-vat-rules-topic/vat-invoicing-rules_en)\n- [United\nKingdom](https://www.gov.uk/invoicing-and-taking-payment-from-customers/invoices-what-they-must-include)\n- [Customers page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/customers)\n-\n[invoice_prefix](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/create#create_customer-invoice_prefix)\n- [2020-03-02](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#2020-03-02)\n-\n[next_invoice_sequence](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/create#create_customer-next_invoice_sequence)\n- [Hosted Invoice Page](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/hosted-invoice-page)\n- [update\ninvoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update#update_invoice-description)\n- [update\nInvoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update#update_invoice-footer)\n-\n[finalized](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/workflow-transitions#finalized)\n- [Invoice Editor](https://dashboard.stripe.com/invoices/create)\n- [Invoices\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create#create_invoice-custom_fields)\n-\n[Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-invoice_settings-custom_fields)\n-\n[preferred_locales](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-preferred_locales)\n-\n[address](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-address)\n-\n[shipping_details](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create#create_invoice-shipping_details)\n-\n[shipping](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-shipping)\n- [Public business information](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public)\n- [Use the Dashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/dashboard)\n- [Send customer emails](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/send-email)",
