You receive payment as if it were a normal one-time charge, with\nfees deducted, and the customerâ€™s bank handles collecting the money over time.\n\nSome restrictions apply to which transactions and cards can use installments.\nReview the [compatibility\nrequirements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/mx-installments#requirements).\n\nAccepting an installment payment incurs [an additional\nfee](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/mx-installments#fees) to the standard\ncredit card transaction fee.\n\nYou can enable installments across a variety of Stripe products.
