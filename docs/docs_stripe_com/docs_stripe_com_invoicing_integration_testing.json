See a complete list of [invoice event\ntypes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-invoice.created).\n- Using the Dashboard to [create\ninvoices](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/invoices/create) in [test\nmode](https://docs.stripe.com/test-mode).\n\nYou can add an endpoint and see its received events by going to\n[Webhooks](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/webhooks) in the Dashboard.\n\n### Test events with fake data\n\nBy using the Stripe CLI to trigger events, you can see event notifications on\nyour server as they come in. This means that you can check your webhook\nintegration directly without complicating factors such as network tunnels or\nfirewalls. When you use the Stripe CLI, the event your webhook receives contains\nfake data that doesn’t correlate to invoice information.\n\n### Test events with real data\n\nThe most reliable way to test webhook notifications is to create test invoices\nfor existing customers and handle the corresponding events.\n\n## Test payment failures\n\nTo trigger payment failures for invoices, you can use the test credit card\nnumbers in [Declined\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/testing#declined-payments). If you want to\nsimulate a declined payment for a card that’s been successfully attached to a\ncustomer, use **4000 0000 0000 0341** as their default payment method.\n\nDepending on your [retry\nsettings](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/automatic-collection), you might\nhave to wait a day or more to see the first retry attempt. To see what happens\nfor a successful retry, you can use this waiting period to update the customer’s\npayment method to a working test card.\n\n## Test payments that require 3D Secure\n\nUse the [4000 0027 6000 3184](https://docs.stripe.com/testing#regulatory-cards)\ncard to simulate 3D Secure triggering for invoices. When Stripe triggers a 3D\nSecure authentication, you can test authenticating or failing the payment\nattempt in the 3DS dialog that opens. If the payment is authenticated\nsuccessfully, the invoice is paid. When a payment attempt fails, the\nauthentication attempt is unsuccessful and the invoice remains `open`.\n\n## Test bank transfer payments\n\nTo test manual payments on invoices through bank transfers:\n\n- Create a testmode invoice with the collection method set to `send_invoice` and\n`payment_settings[payment_method_types]` array set to `[customer_balance]`.\n- Find the invoice in the Dashboard and click **Send**. This generates a unique\nvirtual bank account number for your customer.\n- Retrieve your customer’s unique virtual bank account number using the\n[Customer Balance Funding Instructions\nAPI)(/docs/payments/customer-balance/funding-instructions#create-funding-instructions).\nYou can also find your customer’s virtual banking details in the Hosted Invoice\nPage and PDF.\n\n## Test customer tax ID verification\n\nUse these magic tax IDs to trigger certain verification conditions in test mode.\nThe tax ID type must be either the EU VAT Number or Australian Business Number\n(ABN).\n\nNumberType`000000000`Successful verification`111111111`Unsuccessful\nverification`222222222`Verification remains pending indefinitely\n\n## Links\n\n- [testing page](https://docs.stripe.com/testing)\n- [Testing Stripe Billing](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/testing)\n- [invoice’s](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n- [status\nchanges](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/workflow-transitions#status-transitions-endpoints)\n- [Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli)\n- [invoice event\ntypes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-invoice.created)\n- [create invoices](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/invoices/create)\n- [test mode](https://docs.stripe.com/test-mode)\n- [Webhooks](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/webhooks)\n- [Declined payments](https://docs.stripe.com/testing#declined-payments)\n- [retry settings](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/automatic-collection)\n- [4000 0027 6000 3184](https://docs.stripe.com/testing#regulatory-cards)",
