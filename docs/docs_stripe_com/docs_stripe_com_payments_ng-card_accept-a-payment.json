We\nrecommend that you configure your payment methods from the Stripe Dashboard\nusing the instructions in [Accept a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web&ui=stripe-hosted).\n\nIf you want to continue manually configuring the payment methods you present to\nyour customers with Checkout, use this guide. Otherwise, update your integration\nto [configure payment methods in the\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/dashboard-payment-methods).\n\nIntegrating with Naira card enables Nigerian customers to pay using\nNigerian-issued cards.\n\nLocal cards offer a redirect-based payment flow. When a customer makes a\npayment, Stripe redirects them to the local merchant of record service\nproviderâ€™s checkout page to authenticate and authorize the payment. After the\ncustomer authorizes the payment, Stripe redirects them back to your site.\n\n[Determine\ncompatibility](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ng-card/accept-a-payment#compatibility)\n[A Checkout\nSession](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/how-checkout-works#session)\nmust satisfy all of the following conditions to support Nigerian payment\nmethods:\n\n- [Prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices) for all line items must be\nexpressed in Nigerian naira (currency code `ngn`).\n- The minimum amount accepted is 500 NGN, and the maximum amount accepted is\n100,000,000 NGN.\n[Accept a Naira card\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ng-card/accept-a-payment#accept-a-ng-card-payment)\nEnable Naira card by making the following updates to your integration.\n\nWhen creating a [Checkout\nSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions), you must do the\nfollowing:\n\n- Add `ng_card` to the list of `payment_method_types`.\n- Make sure all `line_items` use the `ngn` currency.\n\n```\nStripe::Checkout::Session.create({\n mode: 'payment',\n payment_method_types: ['card'],\n payment_method_types: ['card', 'ng_card'],\n line_items: [{\n price_data: {\n currency: 'usd',\n # To accept `ng_card`, all line items must have currency: ngn\n currency: 'ngn',\n product_data: {\n name: 'T-shirt',\n },\n unit_amount: 2000,\n },\n quantity: 1,\n }],\n success_url: 'https://example.com/success',\n cancel_url: 'https://example.com/cancel',\n})\n```\n\n[Test your\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ng-card/accept-a-payment#test-integration)\nWhen testing your Checkout integration, select **Naira payment methods** as the\npayment method and click **Pay**.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Accept a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web&ui=stripe-hosted)\n- [configure payment methods in the\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/dashboard-payment-methods)\n- [A Checkout\nSession](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/how-checkout-works#session)\n- [Prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices)\n- [Checkout Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions)\n- [https://example.com/success](https://example.com/success)\n- [https://example.com/cancel](https://example.com/cancel)",
