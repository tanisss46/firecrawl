# Nested subscription schedule settings under default_settingsBreaking changes

## What’s new

On subscription schedules, `invoice_settings`, `default_payment_method`,
`billing_thresholds` and `collection_method` are now nested under
`default_settings`.

## Impact

Lets you more easily manage the various settings associated with subscription
schedules. By nesting the `invoice_settings`, `default_payment_method`,
`billing_thresholds`, and `collection_method` properties under a new
`default_settings` field, the subscription schedule API becomes more organized
and intuitive.
