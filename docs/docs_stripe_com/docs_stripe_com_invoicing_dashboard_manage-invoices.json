  "content": "# Invoices page\n\n## Learn how to manage your invoices in the Dashboard.\n\nInvoices move through a series of statuses as they’re created and processed. You\ncan track the status of an [invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices) on\nthe [Invoices page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/invoices).\n\n#### Note\n\nYou can remove the header on the Invoices page by closing all of the items in\nthe task list. After you remove the header, you can’t make it reappear.\n\nInvoices in `open` status can display a different badge, such as `Past due` or\n`Retrying`. In some scenarios, you can hover over the badge to view an\nexplanatory tooltip.\n\n#### Note\n\nIf an open non-subscription invoice is waiting for a payment that’s initiated\nbut still pending, it shows the `Pending` badge in the list of invoices.\nHowever, its details page shows the `Open` badge.\n\n![Invoices\npage](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/invoices-page.e6e97cbab0962e47914e2dd446a046b7.png)\n\nInvoices page\n\n## Filter invoices\n\nOn the Invoices page, you can filter the view using the buttons above the list.\nThe **Outstanding** button shows invoices with `open` status. To further refine\nthe list, click **Filter**. You can filter by frequency, status, creation date,\ndue date, and so on.\n\nYou can also configure the information displayed in the **Customer** column.\nClick the gear icon next to that column’s heading and select the customer\ndescription, customer email, list of line items, or a metadata attribute.\n\n![Filter\ninvoices](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/invoices-page-filter.309be8c81d4f7cb9e551923804fe941f.png)\n\nFilter invoices\n\n## Invoice actions\n\nYou see a **Download PDF** button when you hover over the overflow menu ().\nDepending on the invoice status, clicking the button downloads either a PDF of\nthe invoice or a receipt. If the customer has paid the invoice, Stripe generates\na PDF of the receipt. For all other statuses, Stripe generates a PDF of the\ninvoice. The overflow menu also provides additional actions, which allow you to\nduplicate an invoice, delete a draft, or view the customer details associated\nwith an invoice.\n\n#### Note\n\nIf you need the original invoice for a paid invoice, click through to the\n[Invoice details\npage](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/dashboard/manage-invoices#invoice-details-page).\n\n## Export invoices\n\nYou can export all of your invoices, or a subset of them (as a CSV file) by\nusing the **Export** feature.\n\n![Export\ninvoices](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/export-invoices.222e5d15d14c8527fa040da14ee2b510.png)\n\nExport invoices\n\nYou can also [export invoice-related tax\ndata](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/taxes/tax-rates#data-exports).\n\n## Invoice details page\n\nWhen you click an invoice on the Invoices page, its details page opens. If the\ninvoice is in `draft` status and isn’t associated with a subscription, the edit\ninvoice form opens automatically. You can perform a variety of actions on the\ndetails page, such as editing it, adding a note, resending it, or downloading a\nreceipt. The available actions depend on the status of the invoice.\n\n#### Note\n\nAfter Stripe finalizes an invoice, you can’t change its due date. If you need to\nchange the due date, you must\n[void](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/overview#void) (cancel) the original\ninvoice and send a new one.\n\n![Invoice details\npage](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/invoice-details-page.b44b9476aee88475ad7b18558e1d03a8.png)\n\nInvoice details page\n\n## Pending invoice items\n\nYou can see a customer’s pending invoice items by navigating to the [Customers\npage](https://dashboard.stripe.com/customers), and clicking on their name. If\nthe customer has a pending invoice item, it appears under **Pending invoice\nitems**. An invoice item appears as pending if it’s not attached to any invoice.\n\nUnder **Pending invoice items**, you can also choose to create a new invoice\nitem, or instantly invoice everything listed. When you click **Invoice now**, a\ndialog appears that lets you select whether to charge the default source or\nemail the invoice to the customer. Additionally, the dialog gives you the option\nto calculate tax automatically.
