It allows you to\nprevent and manage disputes from the Stripe Dashboard.\n\n[Request invite](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/verifi-beta#request-an-invite)\n\n!\n\nDisputes, also called chargebacks, can result in significant costs. Verifi, a\nVisa solution, helps you save on dispute costs while lowering your dispute rates\nand automating part of your dispute management process.\n\nUse dispute prevention to:\n\n- Set rules to automatically refund specific disputes with Rapid Dispute\nResolution (RDR). Refunded disputes don’t count towards your dispute rate and\ndon’t incur a dispute fee.\n- Prevent disputes by sending extra transaction data with Order Insight (OI).\n- Block disputes entirely if the extra transaction data provided with OI is\nCompelling Evidence (CE 3.0) eligible.\n\nYou can review and manage dispute prevention from the Dashboard. Learn more\nabout [disputes and fraud](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes).\n\n## Benefits\n\nAutomatically refunding disputes can cost less than responding to certain\ndisputes. If you’re part of the Visa Dispute Monitoring Program (VDMP) or the\nVisa Acquirer Monitoring Program (VAMP), then automatically refunding disputes\ncan help you exit the program. Learn more about [monitoring\nprograms](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/monitoring-programs).\n\n![Rate reduction using automatic\nrules.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/verifi-lower-disputes.ea031da338e5a6479b0966e593ed2615.png)\n\n![Turn on dispute prevention in your\ndashboard.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/verifi-zero-integration.8e2e9287f3217f1acb7faca32f71c24b.png)\n\n![Increased revenue\nretention.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/verifi-lower-costs.37f379911d16ca5a4001844c661b0d06.png)\n\n**Lower dispute rates**\n\nAutomatically refunded disputes don’t count towards your dispute rate.\n\n**Zero integration required**\n\nStripe integrates directly with Verifi and provides your existing transaction\ndata on your behalf at time of lookup.\n\n**Lower costs**\n\nFewer disputes means fewer dispute fees and operational costs.\n\n## How it works\n\n### Order Insight\n\nOrder Insight uses your transaction data to help cardholders recognize the\ncharge. When eligible, adding Compelling Evidence 3.0 can block disputes\nentirely.\n\n![The process of adding Order Insight and Compelling Evidence 3.0 to prevent\ndisputes.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/verifi-oi-diagram.21971b1eecb82c373982ee5e88abc4d2.png)\n\n### Rapid Dispute Resolution\n\nRapid Dispute Resolution automatically refunds disputes based on your custom\nrules. These disputes don’t count towards your overall dispute rate.\n\n![How Rapid Dispute Resolution resolves disputes with no impact on your dispute\nrate.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/verifi-rdr-diagram.897ca5e58e077fbb9b4c370c258a346b.png)\n\n## Pricing\n\nPricing is based on your Merchant Category Code (MCC) tier.
