# Customers now include a cards sublist and default_card fieldBreaking changes

## What’s new

Replaces the `active_card` property on the `Customer` object with a `cards`
sublist and a `default_card` ID property.

## Impact

Replacing the `active_card` on the `Customer` object with the `cards` sublist
and `default_card` ID lets you manage multiple cards.
