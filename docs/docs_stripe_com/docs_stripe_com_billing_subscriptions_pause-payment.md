# Pause payment collection

## Learn how to pause payment collection on subscriptions.

#### Caution

Subscriptions with `paused collection` can’t move into `status=paused`. Only
[ending free trial periods without a payment
method](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/trials#create-free-trials-without-payment)
cause subscriptions to enter a [paused
status](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview#subscription-statuses).

Pausing payment collection is often used to temporarily offer your services for
free. This is sometimes referred to as a “grace period” if a customer needs
additional time to pay or can’t pay for one or more billing cycles.

You can pause or resume collection in the [Stripe
Dashboard](https://support.stripe.com/questions/how-to-pause-or-cancel-subscriptions)
or the API. While collection is paused,
[subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating) still
generate [invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices), but you have a few
options for handling these invoices. Review the following use cases to determine
the best approach for you:

Use caseAPI configuration[Temporarily offer services for free and never collect
payment](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/pause-payment#collect-payment-never)Use
`behavior=void`[Temporarily offer services for free and collect payment
later](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/pause-payment#collect-payment-later)Use
`behavior=keep_as_draft`[Temporarily offer services for free and mark invoice as
uncollectible](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/pause-payment#mark-as-uncollectible)Use
`behavior=mark_uncollectible`
If these options don’t fit your use case, you might want to consider [canceling
subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/cancel) instead.

Invoices created before subscriptions are paused continue to be
[retried](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/automatic-collection) unless you
[void](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/void) them.

## Temporarily offer services for free and never collect payment

If you temporarily want to offer your services for free and you don’t want to
collect payment on the invoice (for example, a “grace period”), you can void
invoices that your subscription creates to make sure that your customers aren’t
charged and the subscription remains `status=active`. Use the Subscription ID to
update `pause_collection[behavior]` to `void` and `pause_collection[resumes_at]`
to the date you want to start collecting payments again.

```
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscriptions/{{SUBSCRIPTION_ID}} \
 -u "sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:" \
 -d "pause_collection[behavior]"=void
```

All invoices created before the `resumes_at` date are immediately marked as
void. Stripe won’t send any upcoming invoice emails or webhooks and the
subscription’s status remains unchanged.

If you don’t set a `resumes_at` date, the subscription remains paused until you
unset `pause_collection`.

## Temporarily offer services for free and collect payment later

If you want to temporarily offer your services for free and collect payments
later, set `pause_collection[behavior]=keep_as_draft`. If you know when you want
to resume collection, pass a timestamp for `resumes_at`.

```
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscriptions/{{SUBSCRIPTION_ID}} \
 -u "sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:" \
 -d "pause_collection[behavior]"=keep_as_draft
```

All invoices created before the `resumes_at` date remain in `draft` state and
`auto_advance` is set to `false`. During this time, Stripe won’t send any
upcoming invoice emails or webhooks for these invoices and the subscription’s
status remains unchanged.

If you don’t set a `resumes_at` date, the subscription remains paused until you
unset `pause_collection`.

#### Caution

If you have custom logic that finalizes invoices you might need to disable or
modify it so that it doesn’t conflict with these settings.

When you’re ready to collect payment for these invoices, set `auto_advance` back
to `true`. If you don’t have the invoice IDs, you can use Subscription IDs to
check for invoices with `status=draft`. Using the invoice ID, you can then
update `auto_advance=true`:

```
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/invoices/{{INVOICE_ID}} \
 -u "sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:" \
 -d auto_advance=true
```

## Temporarily offer services for free and mark invoices as uncollectible

If you temporarily want to offer your services for free and mark any invoices
generated by the subscription as uncollectible, use the Subscription ID to
update `pause_collection[behavior]` to `mark_uncollectible` and optionally
`pause_collection[resumes_at]` to the date you want to start collecting payments
again. This makes sure that any downstream reporting is accurate, your customer
isn’t charged, and the subscription remains `status=active`.

```
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscriptions/{{SUBSCRIPTION_ID}} \
 -u "sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:" \
 -d "pause_collection[behavior]"=mark_uncollectible
```

If you set `pause_collection[behavior]` to `mark_uncollectible`, we’ll stop
active payment collection on new invoices the subscription creates before the
`resumes_at` date. Stripe won’t send any upcoming invoice emails or webhooks for
these invoices.

Despite this pause, Stripe applies any existing customer balance to invoices.
This behavior helps use available funds before we mark an invoice as
`uncollectible`. If the invoice’s `total` is paid off entirely using customer
balance, then the invoice’s status is set to `paid`. Otherwise, the invoice’s
status is set to `uncollectible`.

If you don’t set a `resumes_at` date, the payment collection on the subscription
remains paused until you unset `pause_collection`.

## Manually unpausing

To resume collecting payments at any time, you can update the subscription and
unset `pause_collection`:

```
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscriptions/sub_GTbTiykEwMRog0 \
 -u sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2: \
 -d "pause_collection"=
```

Resuming collection this way only affects future invoices.

## Pausing and subscription schedules

If you pause a subscription on a [subscription
schedule](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/subscription-schedules),
the scheduled updates still take effect. However, payment is not collected while
the subscription is paused. When you want to collect payment again, you need to
[manually
unpause](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/pause-payment#unpausing)
the subscription. You also need to update `auto_advance` to `true` on any
invoices with `status=draft` that you want to collect payment on.
