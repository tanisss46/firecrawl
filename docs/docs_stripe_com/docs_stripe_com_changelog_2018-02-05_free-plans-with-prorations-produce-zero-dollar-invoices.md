# Free plans with prorations now produce zero-dollar invoicesBreaking changes

## What’s new

Prorations on free plans now create 0 USD invoices. In past versions, these
didn’t create invoices.

## Impact

This change generates 0 USD invoices for prorations on free plans, where
previously no invoices were created. You can now maintain a complete record of
all plan changes, including those involving free plans, providing better
transparency and consistency in billing history.
