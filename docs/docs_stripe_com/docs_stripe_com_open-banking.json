This is\nknown as access to accounts, or open banking.\n\nOpen banking allows third parties to request three types of access to users’\npayment accounts:\n\n- **Access account information:** Account Information Service Providers (AISPs)\ncan view accounts, balances and transactions of a payment account.\n- **Confirming that funds are available:** Before a payment can be completed,\nPayment Initiation Service Providers (PISPs) can check if the balance of an\naccount has sufficient funds.\n- **Initiating new payments:** Payment Initiation Service Providers (PISPs) can\ninitiate a payment from a user’s payment account.\n\n## Open banking for Payments and Issuing Accounts\n\nOpen banking for Payments and Issuing Accounts is available in EU and UK.\n\n### EU\n\nFor information related to open banking support for Payments and Issuing\naccounts in EU, see the [API\ndocumentation](https://developer.api-v1-eu.stripeopenbanking.com/).\n\nOur Open banking API performance metrics provide visibility into availability\nand performance in the last quarter.
