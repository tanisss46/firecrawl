  "content": "# Japan 3DS mandate exemptions\n\n## Use exemptions to reduce cardholder friction on eligible payments.\n\nIndustry guidelines in Japan require online businesses to use [3D Secure\n(3DS)](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure) by the end of March 2025. For\nmore information about the guidelines, see the [Stripe Support\narticle](https://support.stripe.com/questions/3ds-mandate-in-japan).\n\nIn cases where the guidelines allow exemptions, Stripe does not force 3DS on\nyour payments.\n\nIn general, Stripe attempts to process a 3DS authentication on all cards at\nleast once, either when the card is saved or when it’s first used. Stripe\ndoesn’t require 3DS on payments made using cards that are already 3DS\nauthenticated.\n\n#### Note\n\nWhen payments are made without 3DS by using an exemption, liability shift for\nfraudulent payments doesn’t apply. If you want to apply 3DS liability shift to\n3DS-exempt payments, you must request 3DS by setting `request_three_d_secure` to\n`any` in your PaymentIntent or SetupIntent.\n\nCategoryDescriptionExisting cardsCards entered before Apr 1, 2025, or that were\nmigrated to Stripe from other processors, are treated as if they were previously\nauthenticated with 3DS.\nSituations where 3DS isn’t possible\n\nStripe doesn’t automatically use 3DS for:\n\n- Debit cards and prepaid cards\n- Apple Pay and Google Pay\n- [MOTO\npayments](https://support.stripe.com/questions/mail-order-telephone-order-(moto)-transactions-when-to-categorize-transactions-as-moto)\n\nIf any of the following cases apply to your integration, you must request\nenablement by contacting [Stripe\nSupport](https://support.stripe.com/contact/email).\n\n- You don’t use Stripe Customer objects. For example, you create payments with\nraw card numbers.\n- You store and authenticate cards outside of Stripe.\n- You process payments from devices that don’t support 3DS, such as game\nconsoles or smart speakers.\n\n[Customer-Initiated Transactions\n(CIT)](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/cits-and-mits)\n\n(For example, saving a card on an e-commerce website for later purchases)\n\n- Saving a card by creating a SetupIntent with `usage=on_session` doesn’t use\n3DS unless you [request\nit](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents/object#setup_intent_object-payment_method_options-card-request_three_d_secure).\n- If you don’t authenticate a card with 3DS when you save it, the first payment\nwith that card requires 3DS.\n- After a saved card is authenticated with 3DS, Stripe treats it as exempt and\ndoesn’t force 3DS on future payments with that card. However, your integration\nmust conduct a risk analysis at the time of each subsequent payment and request\n3DS if the analysis determines that it’s appropriate. You can use [Stripe\nRadar](https://stripe.com/radar) to conduct the risk analysis.\n- Design your customer login process to meet at least two of the following five\n[Credit Card Transactions Security Measures Council Security\nChecklist](https://support.stripe.com/questions/japan-security-checklist)\nrequirements. If it doesn’t, you must manually request 3DS for each payment by\nsetting\n[request_three_d_secure](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-payment_method_options-card-request_three_d_secure)\nto `any`.- Restrict access from suspicious IP addresses, to counter attacks from\noverseas.\n- Limit login attempts, to prevent account password cracking.\n- Authenticate users through two-factor authentication or a similar measure, to\nnotify users of fraudulent login attempts.\n- Send email or SMS notifications, throttle attempts, or take other similar\nmeasures when your customer logs in.\n- Use “device fingerprinting” or similar measures.\n- Payments with [Link](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link) are exempted\nbecause Link’s login process implements the following measures:- Limits login\nattempts to prevent account password cracking.\n- Sends email or SMS notifications, throttle attempts, or take other similar\nmeasures when your customer logs in.\n[Merchant-Initiated Transactions\n(MIT)](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/cits-and-mits), including Stripe\nBilling- Saving a card by creating a SetupIntent with `usage=off_session`\nrequires 3DS.\n- If a card is 3DS authenticated when it’s saved, payments using that card don’t\nrequire 3DS.\n- If any change to a contract, service, or product requires customer approval,\nthe associated payment must be customer-initiated\n([CIT](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/cits-and-mits)) and must [explicitly\nrequest\n3DS](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-payment_method_options-card-request_three_d_secure).\n\n## Links\n\n- [3D Secure (3DS)](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure)\n- [Stripe Support\narticle](https://support.stripe.com/questions/3ds-mandate-in-japan)\n- [MOTO\npayments](https://support.stripe.com/questions/mail-order-telephone-order-(moto)-transactions-when-to-categorize-transactions-as-moto)\n- [Stripe Support](https://support.stripe.com/contact/email)\n- [Customer-Initiated Transactions\n(CIT)](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/cits-and-mits)\n- [request\nit](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents/object#setup_intent_object-payment_method_options-card-request_three_d_secure)\n- [Stripe Radar](https://stripe.com/radar)\n- [Credit Card Transactions Security Measures Council Security\nChecklist](https://support.stripe.com/questions/japan-security-checklist)\n-\n[request_three_d_secure](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-payment_method_options-card-request_three_d_secure)\n- [Link](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link)",
