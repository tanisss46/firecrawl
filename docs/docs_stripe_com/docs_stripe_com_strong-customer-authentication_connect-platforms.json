  "content": "# SCA migration guide for Connect platforms\n\n## Learn how to update your Connect platform for Strong Customer Authentication (SCA).\n\n[Strong Customer\nAuthentication](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication) applies\nto businesses based in the [European Economic\nArea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Area) (EEA) that accept\nonline payments from customers located in the EEA. Many card payments require\nadditional authentication through [3D\nSecure](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure). As of September 14, 2019,\ntransactions that don’t follow the new authentication guidelines might be\ndeclined by a customer’s bank.\n\nYou need to update your platform if you create any of the following charges:\n\n- [Direct charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges) on a\nconnected account based in the EEA.\n- [Destination charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges) if\nthe `on_behalf_of` parameter is set and specifies a connected account based in\nthe EEA.\n- [Separate charges and\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers) if\nyour platform is based in the EEA or if the `on_behalf_of` parameter is set and\nspecifies a connected account based in the EEA.\n[Choose an SCA-ready\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication/connect-platforms#choose-integration)\nYou need to update your Stripe integration to meet SCA requirements. For\nexample, SCA requires off-session payments to be authenticated when customers\nenter payment details, and subsequent off-session payments might require\nnotifying the customer to return to the application to re-authenticate.\n\nChoose [Stripe Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout) if it\nsupports the features your integration requires. Checkout is a hosted payment\npage that can be branded by businesses, supports recurring\n[subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating), and\nsupports SCA for your connected accounts. It supports creating [direct\ncharges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges) and [destination\ncharges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges) for\n[Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect).\n\nIf you want to build custom payments, use the [Payment Intents\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents) as the legacy Charges API\nisn’t SCA-ready. The Payment Intents API supports the same set of Connect\nfeatures as the Charges API.\n\n[Examine Connect-specific\nchanges](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication/connect-platforms#examine-connect-specific-changes)\n### Destination charge changes\n\nIf you’re using the `destination`, `destination[account]`, or\n`destination[amount]` parameters with the Charges API, note that these\nparameters have been replaced with `transfer_data[destination]` and\n`transfer_data[amount]` in both the Charges and the Payment Intents APIs. See\nthe following table for more information.\n\nUse case Charges APIPayment Intents APIYour platform is the merchant of record,\nbut you wish to create a transfer to a connected account after the payment\ncompletesNot possibleSet\n[transfer_data[destination]](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-transfer_data-destination)\nto the connected account’s IDYou want your connected account to be the\nsettlement merchant without creating a separate transfer after the payment\ncompletesSet `on_behalf_of` to the connected account’s IDNo changeYou want your\nconnected account to be the settlement merchant and you wish to create a\ntransfer to that account after the payment completesSet `destination` or\n`destination[account]` to the connected account’s IDSet\n[transfer_data[destination]](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-transfer_data-destination)\nand\n[on_behalf_of](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-on_behalf_of)\nto the connected account’s IDYou wish to collect an application feeSet\n`application_fee` to the amount desiredSet\n[application_fee_amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-application_fee_amount)\nto the amount desiredYou wish to transfer a partial amount to your connected\naccount after the payment completesSet `destination[amount]` to the amount to\ntransferSet\n[transfer_data[amount]](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-transfer_data)\nto the amount to transfer\n### 3D Secure and Radar rules\n\nStripe Checkout and the Payment Intents API triggers [dynamic 3D Secure\nauthentication](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure/authentication-flow#three-ds-radar)\nbased on [Radar rules](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules). With Connect, the\nrules you create only apply to payments created on the platform account.\nPayments [created directly on the connected\naccount](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges) are subject to the\nconnected account’s rules. Configure your default rules and test your\nintegration with [3D Secure test\ncards](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure/authentication-flow#three-ds-cards).\n\n### SCA impact on saving payment methods\n\nUnder SCA, authentication is required when saving a card in order to collect\ncustomer permission and qualify for [off-session\nexemptions](https://stripe.com/guides/strong-customer-authentication#merchant-initiated-transactions-including-variable-subscriptions)\nfor subsequent off-session payments. To reduce the rate of customers having to\nauthenticate their payment method, update your integration to use off-session\npayments with the Payment Intents API [in a checkout\nflow](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-during-payment) or [outside the\ncheckout\nflow](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-and-reuse?platform=checkout).\n\nIf you [clone saved payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/cloning-customers-across-accounts) to\nreuse across multiple connected accounts, sharing a payment method with a\nconnected account automatically shares customer permission as well. This allows\nthe platform to make off-session payments on any of their connected accounts\nwithout requiring the customer to authenticate their payment method again.\n\n[Determine whether connected accounts need to make\nchanges](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication/connect-platforms#connected-account-changes)\nIn most cases, after you update your payments integration for SCA, your\nconnected accounts don’t have to do any additional work.\n\nIf you provide your own payments API to your connected accounts in addition to\nor on top of Stripe’s API, your connected accounts might need to make changes to\ncontinue accepting payments on your platform. For example, if you run a\nsubscriptions platform on Stripe in which your connected accounts pass payment\ninformation to you using your own API, and then you pass those payment details\nto Stripe’s API, both APIs must be SCA-ready. If this is the case for your\nplatform, provide guidance to your connected accounts on any changes they need\nto make.\n\n[Implement and test the new integration\npath](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication/connect-platforms#implement-changes)\nAfter you have identified your integration path and determined if your connected\naccounts need to make changes, follow the relevant migration guides for [Stripe\nCheckout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/migration), [Stripe\nBilling](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication),\nor the [Payment Intents\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents/migration).\n\nOnce implementation is complete, configure your [Dynamic 3D Secure\nrules](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure/authentication-flow#three-ds-radar)\nto test your integration using [3D Secure test\ncards](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure/authentication-flow#three-ds-cards).\nMake sure to test both cases when the authentication is successful and\nunsuccessful.\n\n[Educate your connected\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication/connect-platforms#educate)\nFinally, inform your connected accounts about how SCA can affect them and when\nyour platform will be SCA-ready, regardless of whether they need to [make any\nchanges](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication/connect-platforms#implement-changes).\n\nIn particular, provide them with the following information, tailored for your\nbusiness:\n\nStrong [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers) Authentication (SCA) is\na new European regulatory requirement to reduce fraud and make online payments\nmore secure. Since SCA took effect September 14, 2019, online payments require\nadditional customer authentication. Transactions that don’t adhere to the new\nguidelines may be declined by your customers’ banks. This regulation applies to\ntransactions where both the business and the cardholder’s bank are located in\nthe European Economic Area (EEA).\n\nIf you’d like, you can also send along the [SCA\nvideo](https://stripe.com/payments/strong-customer-authentication) and\n[guide](https://stripe.com/guides/strong-customer-authentication).\n\n### How your platform should support SCA\n\nIf you’re not migrating to an SCA-ready solution, reach out to any of your\nconnected accounts with significant business from European customers so they can\nmove to a new solution before experiencing declines due to SCA.\n\n### Any actions your connected accounts need to take\n\nIf no action is required on their end, let your connected accounts know.\nSimilarly, if action is required, provide them with instructions on the\nnecessary changes.\n\n### How SCA can affect their business\n\nSCA changes the checkout flow for card payments. Payments that require\nauthentication ask for [3D Secure](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure)\n(often known by its brand names, “Verified by Visa” or “Mastercard SecureCode”),\nwhich typically adds an extra step in which the cardholder must provide\nadditional information, such as a one-time passcode or biometric ID.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Strong Customer\nAuthentication](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication)\n- [European Economic Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Area)\n- [3D Secure](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure)\n- [Direct charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges)\n- [Destination charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges)\n- [Separate charges and\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n- [Stripe Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout)\n- [subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating)\n- [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)\n- [Payment Intents API](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents)\n-\n[transfer_data[destination]](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-transfer_data-destination)\n-\n[on_behalf_of](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-on_behalf_of)\n-\n[application_fee_amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-application_fee_amount)\n-\n[transfer_data[amount]](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-transfer_data)\n- [dynamic 3D Secure\nauthentication](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure/authentication-flow#three-ds-radar)\n- [Radar rules](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules)\n- [3D Secure test\ncards](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure/authentication-flow#three-ds-cards)\n- [off-session\nexemptions](https://stripe.com/guides/strong-customer-authentication#merchant-initiated-transactions-including-variable-subscriptions)\n- [in a checkout flow](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-during-payment)\n- [outside the checkout\nflow](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-and-reuse?platform=checkout)\n- [clone saved payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/cloning-customers-across-accounts)\n- [Stripe Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/migration)\n- [Stripe\nBilling](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication)\n- [Payment Intents\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents/migration)\n- [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers)\n- [SCA video](https://stripe.com/payments/strong-customer-authentication)\n- [guide](https://stripe.com/guides/strong-customer-authentication)",
