# Payment Methods API

## Learn more about the API that powers a range of global payment methods.

The Payment Methods API allows you to accept a variety of payment methods
through a single API. A
[PaymentMethod](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object) object
contains the payment method details to create payments. With the Payment Methods
API, you can combine a
[PaymentMethod](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods):

- With a [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents) to accept
a payment
- With a [SetupIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents) and a
[Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers) to save payment details for
later

## Supported payment methods

To determine which payment methods to use for specific locales, see the [guide
to payment methods](https://stripe.com/payments/payment-methods-guide).

The guide includes available payment methods for different regions, a detailed
description of each payment method’s characteristics, and the [geographic
regions](https://stripe.com/payments/payment-methods-guide#payment-methods-fact-sheets)
where they’re most relevant. You can enable any payment methods available to you
in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/). Activation is generally
instantaneous and doesn’t require additional contracts.

## Customer actions

​​Some payment methods require your customer to take additional steps to
complete the payment. The PaymentIntent object’s `next_action` parameter
specifies the type of customer action.

Some common actions that customers need to perform are:

- ​​Redirect to their bank’s online service to authenticate and approve the
payment.
- Verify ownership of their account by providing a one-time code that you post
to the Stripe API (for example, microdeposits).
- Push funds (for example, in the case for bank transfers) through their bank’s
online service.

Not all payment methods require additional customer actions. For example, card
payments (excluding 3D Secure) require no additional authentication beyond
collecting card details.

#### Note

For payment methods that require customer action, configure [webhook
endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#webhooks) for
notifications on whether a payment has succeeded or not.

## Immediate or delayed notification of payment success

Some payment methods immediately return payment status when a transaction is
attempted (for example, card payments) but other methods have a delay such as
ACH debits. For those that immediately return payment status, the PaymentIntent
status either changes to `succeeded` or `requires_payment_method`. A status of
`succeeded` guarantees that you will receive the funds from your customers.

Payment methods with delayed notification can’t guarantee payment during the
delay. The status of the PaymentIntent object will be `processing` until the
payment status is either successful or failed. It’s common for businesses to
hold an order in a *pending* state during this time, not fulfilling the order
until the payment is successful.

#### Note

​​For payment methods with delayed notification, configure [webhook
endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#webhooks) for
notifications on whether a payment has succeeded or not.

## Single-use or reusable

You can reuse certain payment methods (for example, cards or bank debits) for
additional payments without authorizing and collecting payment details again.

You should always set up reusable payment methods for future use to reduce the
chance of future declines and payment friction (such as [authentication being
required](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication)). Reusable
payment methods can be [set up for future use when accepting a
payment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-during-payment) or [set up for
future use without taking a
payment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-and-reuse).

Single-use payment methods (for example, some kinds of bank transfers) can’t be
attached to customers because they’re consumed after a payment attempt.

## Use webhooks to track payment status

Configure webhooks by creating a [webhook endpoint or other type of event
destination](https://docs.stripe.com/event-destinations) for payment methods
that either require customer action or when payment notification is delayed.
Stripe sends the following events when the `PaymentIntent` status is updated:

EventDescriptionNext steps`payment_intent.processing`The customer’s payment was
submitted to Stripe successfully. Only applicable to payment methods with
[delayed
notification](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#payment-notification).Wait
for the initiated payment to succeed or fail.`payment_intent.succeeded`The
payment succeeded.Fulfill the purchased goods or
services.`payment_intent.payment_failed`The payment failed.Send an email or push
notification to request another payment method.
​​You can also use the following options instead of setting up an event
destination to listen to events:

- Manually track the status of payments in the Stripe Dashboard, if your
business accepts a low volume of orders from payment methods with delayed
notification. The Dashboard allows you to [view all your Stripe
payments](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payments), send email receipts,
handle payouts, or retry failed payments.
- Use polling (for example, repeatedly retrieving a PaymentIntent so that you
can check its status). Note that polling is significantly less reliable and may
not work at scale. Stripe enforces rate limiting on API requests, so exercise
caution if you use polling.
- Use a partner application to handle common business events, like
[automation](https://stripe.partners/?f_category=automation) or [marketing and
sales](https://stripe.partners/?f_category=marketing-and-sales), by integrating
a partner application.

## The PaymentMethod object

A PaymentMethod contains reusable payment method details for creating payments
(for example, card expiration date or billing address), it doesn’t include
transaction-specific information (for example, amount, currency). A
PaymentMethod is attached to a PaymentIntent to represent the [states of a
payment lifecycle](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/paymentintents/lifecycle).
Each PaymentMethod has a [type
attribute](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object#payment_method_object-type)
(for example, `"type": "sepa_debit"` ) and an additional hash whose name matches
the type and contains information specific to the PaymentMethod type (for
example, `"sepa_debit":{}`). Example of a `sepa_debit` PaymentMethod object:

```
{
 "id": "pm_123456789",
 "object": "payment_method",
 "billing_details": {
 "address": {...},
 "email": "jenny@example.com",
 "name": "Jenny Rosen",
 "phone": "+335555555555"
 },
 "sepa_debit": {
 "bank_code": "37040044",
 "branch_code": "94832",
 "country": "FR",
 "fingerprint": "ygEJfUjzWMGyWnZg",
 "last4": "3000"
 },
 "type": "sepa_debit",
 (...)
}
```

#### Note

To safely handle sensitive payment information and automatically handle customer
actions, Stripe recommends that you create payment methods using
[Stripe.js](https://docs.stripe.com/js#stripe-create-payment-method).
