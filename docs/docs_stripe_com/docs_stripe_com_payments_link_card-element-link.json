  "content": "# Link in the Card Element\n\n## Enable checkout using Link with the Card Element.\n\n#### Caution\n\nStripe no longer recommends using the Card Element as part of your Web Elements\nintegration. To integrate Link, use one of our preferred Elements: the Link\nAuthentication Element, Express Checkout Element, or Payment Element.\n\nUse [Link](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link) in the Card Element to save\nand autofill payment information for your customers, so they don’t need to enter\ntheir payment details manually.\n\nThe Card Element can take on two forms: a single line [Card\nElement](https://docs.stripe.com/js/element/other_element?type=card) or split\nElements (like [Card\nNumber](https://docs.stripe.com/js/element/other_element?type=cardNumber),\n[Expiry](https://docs.stripe.com/js/element/other_element?type=cardExpiry), and\n[CVC](https://docs.stripe.com/js/element/other_element?type=cardCvc)). When\nreferring to the Card Element, the following information applies to both forms.\n\n## The Link flow\n\nSingle line Card ElementSplit Elements\nWhen Link is enabled, the card input form displays a **Link** button, which an\nauthenticated customer can click to autofill their payment details. They only\nneed to authenticate their account once every 90 days on any Link-enabled\nbusiness.\n\n![Link autofilling customer payment\ndetails](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/link-single-ce-returning-user.e50d94e96551810ac4f95c2fabfd33b9.png)\n\nLink autofilling customer payment details\n\nIf a customer hasn’t signed up for Link and they click the **Link** button,\nthey’re asked to add their email address, phone number, and payment method. A\ncustomer can also enter their card details into the Card Element first, and save\nthat card in a Link account.\n\n![A customer signing up for\nLink](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/link-single-ce-new-user.b8495f2e5258b8cf04b5d43e3a290ec0.png)\n\nA customer signing up for Link\n\nIf a returning Link customer clicks the **Link** button and needs to\nauthenticate, Link asks them to do it with an SMS or email code. After the\ncustomer authenticates, Link loads their previously saved payment details,\nallowing them to check out faster.\n\n![Link authenticating a\ncustomer](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/link-in-ce-dialog.ec3340f0aaa847f610249e7dcc3fb7ad.png)\n\nLink authenticating a customer\n\nWe’re continuously optimizing Link to improve checkout conversion, and may\nselectively show Link when it’s most beneficial to customers at checkout. You\ncan expect to see changes over time, including how and when Link appears.\n\n## Link enablement\n\nLink is supported in the [Card\nElement](https://docs.stripe.com/js/element/other_element?type=card) globally\nfor all businesses with granted access and doesn’t require additional fees or\ncode changes (see note below for details). Link is fully compatible with the\nother features you receive from card payments.\n\nStripe automatically enables Link in the Card Element. You can disable Link for\nall instances of the Card Element in your [Payment Method\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods). In the Link\nsection, click the overflow menu () next to the Link row, and disable **Link in\nCard Element**. This setting applies to both forms of the Card Element. You can\nalso set the\n[disableLink](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_element?type=card#elements_create-options-disableLink)\nparameter to `true` to disable Link in the Card Element. You only need to use\none of these controls to hide Link in the Card Element.\n\nLink *isn’t* visible in the Card Element if:\n\n- The parent container that the Card Element is mounted in is too short in\nheight or narrow in width to display the Link button. Typically, we require a\nminimum width of 350px and height of 28px. However, other factors such as font\nsize, locale, placeholder text, and card icon visibility can also affect these\nrequirements.\n- The Card Element is displayed on a browser that doesn’t support pop-ups,\nincluding in-app browsers. View information about [supported\nbrowsers](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/card-element-link#test-link-in-the-card-element).\n- The\n[Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy)\nis set to `same-origin`. The Link pop-up must communicate with the page that\nopened it, so Link in the Card Element isn’t compatible with configurations that\nblock this communication.\n\n#### Note\n\nWe’re releasing Link in the Card Element in phases. Link for the [single line\nCard Element](https://docs.stripe.com/js/element/other_element?type=card) was\nreleased in 2023, followed by Link in [split\nElements](https://docs.stripe.com/js/element/other_element?type=cardNumber) in\nlate 2023 and early 2024. Only accounts with granted access can see Link in the\nCard Element in their [Payment Method\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/link) or use Link in production\nor in a sandbox. Link isn’t currently supported for Stripe accounts based in\nIndia.\n\n## Use the Card Element and Payment Request Button\n\nYou can also use Link with the [Payment Request\nButton](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/payment-request-button-link). Link\nin the Card Element operates independently from Link in the Payment Request\nbutton. If you use both the Payment Request Button and the Card Element, Link\nmight appear in both during checkout. For more information on when Link appears\nin the Payment Request Button, see [Link in the Payment Request\nButton](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/payment-request-button-link).\n\n## Link and Connect platforms\n\nLink is automatically available to any accounts that access the Card Element\nthrough a Connect platform integration. Depending on a platform’s integration, a\nplatform may be able to give its users ([connected\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/enable-payment-acceptance-guide?platform=web#create-account))\nthe ability to customize their own Link settings in the Dashboard:\n\n### Eligibility requirements for connected platforms\n\nIf the following conditions are all met by your platform, then your connected\naccounts can manage their Link settings directly in their own Dashboard.\n\n- You use [direct charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges).\n- You create and charge payment methods on your connected accounts.\n- Your connected accounts have access to the full Stripe Dashboard.\n\nTo set the default state for all connected accounts on your platform:\n\n- Click **Edit settings** under **Your connected accounts** in [Payment Method\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/payment_methods).\n- Navigate to **Link in the Card Element** in the Link section.\n\n### Ineligible connected platforms\n\nIn the following cases, Link is controlled by your platform account settings,\nand your connected accounts can’t customize their Link settings for payments\nprocessed through your platform:\n\n- You create payment methods on your platform and then [clone payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges-multiple-accounts#clone-and-create-direct-charges)\nto your connected accounts.\n- You use [destination\ncharges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges) or [separate\ncharges and\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers).\n- Your connected accounts don’t have access to the full Stripe Dashboard.\n\nTo manage your platform account settings:\n\n- Click **Edit settings** under **Your Account** in [Payment Method\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/payment_methods).\n- Navigate to **Link in the Card Element** in the Link section. If you want to\nturn Link off for only specific connected accounts, you can use the\n[disableLink](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_element?type=card#elements_create-options-disableLink)\nparameter.\n\n### Payment processing for connected accounts\n\n- If your platform offers you the ability to customize your Link settings for\nplatform payments, then you can manage your Link in Card Element settings within\n[Payment Method settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods)\nby selecting your platform from the dropdown menu at the top of the page.\n- If your platform isn’t able to offer you settings customization, then the\nplatform determines Link’s availability for all payments processed through the\nplatform, and you won’t have settings control for platform payments in your\nDashboard.\n- For payments you process without a platform, you can manage Link in your\n[Payment Method settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods)\nby selecting “no platform” from the dropdown menu at the top of the page.\n\n## Test Link in the Card Element\n\n#### Caution\n\nDon’t store real user data in [sandbox](https://docs.stripe.com/sandboxes) Link\naccounts. Treat them as if they’re publicly available, because these test\naccounts are associated with your publishable key.\n\nLink works with the following browsers:\n\n- Chrome, Chrome Mobile, and Microsoft Edge.\n- Safari on desktop and iOS (last 3 major versions).\n\nLink is available in both production and in a sandbox. You can create sandbox\nLink accounts using any valid email address. The following table shows the fixed\none-time passcode values that Stripe accepts for authenticating Link sandbox\naccounts:\n\nValueOutcomeAny other 6 digits not listed belowSuccess000001Error, code\ninvalid000002Error, code expired000003Error, max attempts exceeded\nEnabling Link in a sandbox presents Link on all Card Element sandbox sessions\nthat meet the [enablement\nrequirements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/card-element-link#enable-link).\nIn production, Link’s visibility might vary to maximize Link’s conversion\nbenefits in each checkout session.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Stripe Web Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements)\n- [Link Authentication\nElement](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements/link-authentication-element)\n- [Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Link](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link)\n- [Card Element](https://docs.stripe.com/js/element/other_element?type=card)\n- [Card\nNumber](https://docs.stripe.com/js/element/other_element?type=cardNumber)\n- [Expiry](https://docs.stripe.com/js/element/other_element?type=cardExpiry)\n- [CVC](https://docs.stripe.com/js/element/other_element?type=cardCvc)\n- [Payment Method\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods)\n-\n[disableLink](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_element?type=card#elements_create-options-disableLink)\n-\n[Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy)\n- [Payment Method settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/link)\n- [Payment Request\nButton](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/payment-request-button-link)\n- [connected\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/enable-payment-acceptance-guide?platform=web#create-account)\n- [direct charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges)\n- [Payment Method\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/payment_methods)\n- [clone payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges-multiple-accounts#clone-and-create-direct-charges)\n- [destination charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges)\n- [separate charges and\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n- [sandbox](https://docs.stripe.com/sandboxes)\n- [Stripe Web Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements)\n- [Link Authentication\nElement](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements/link-authentication-element)\n- [Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element)",
