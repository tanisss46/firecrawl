# Accept payments after incorporating

## Accept Stripe payments after you incorporate, and before receiving an EIN.

Atlas startups can accept payments immediately after incorporating and before
receiving their EIN.

Stripe notifies you by email and in your [Atlas
Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/atlas) when we retrieve your EIN from
the IRS. We also automatically add your EIN to your Stripe account.

## Charge customers immediately after incorporating

You can start accepting US card payments on Stripe before receiving your EIN.
Stripe offers no-code payment options like [Payment
Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links) and
[Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing). Atlas companies receive one year
of free payment processing on Stripe, up to 100,000 USD in revenue.

To activate Stripe Payments:

- Wait for your company to be incorporated in Delaware, which typically takes
1–2 business days after submitting your Atlas application.
- Click the link under the **Charge Your First Customers** panel in your Atlas
Dashboard or go to [Activate Stripe
Payments](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/onboarding).
- Atlas automatically pre-fills the payment application with information you
provided in your Atlas application. To complete the application, you need to
provide a US phone number and enter a personal ID number in the business
representative section (you can use your government-issued ID number).

If you need help getting a US phone number, our partners in the **Perks**
section of the Atlas Dashboard can assist you.

## Receive payouts

You can use [Payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts) to transfer your Stripe
balance to your bank account only after receiving your EIN. Once your EIN is
available, you can also access additional payment methods beyond US card
payments.

Atlas gets your EIN within 1–2 business days when founders provide a:

- US company address
- Phone number
- US social security number

If any of these details are missing, it might take 35–45 business days for Atlas
to get your EIN.

## Choose your payments product

Atlas startups often start by using [Payment
Links](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payment-links) to accept payments without
writing code. These are full payment pages you can create in a few clicks, and
share with customers by using a link. Stripe also offers other [no-code payment
options](https://docs.stripe.com/no-code) to help you start accepting payments.
