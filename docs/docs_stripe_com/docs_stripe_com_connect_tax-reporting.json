  "content": "# US tax reporting for Connect platforms\n\n## Learn how to report the annual payments for your US-based connected accounts.\n\nStripe [Connect](https://stripe.com/connect) allows platforms to provide a\nseamless, end-to-end payment service for their connected accounts. This service\nmay come with certain responsibilities, including tax information reporting.\n\n#### Getting your 1099 Forms\n\nIf you work for a platform that pays you via Stripe and want to learn about your\n1099 forms and how to get them, see [1099 tax\nforms](https://support.stripe.com/express/topics/1099-tax-forms) on the Stripe\nSupport site.\n\nStripe issues 1099-K forms for your connected accounts that have transactions\nwhere\n[controller.fees.payer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-controller-fees-payer)\n= `account` or `application_unified_accounts_beta`.\n\nFor transactions where `controller.fees.payer` = `application`, if your\nconnected accounts pay the processing fees for those transactions to Stripe,\nthey could be included in a Stripe-issued 1099.\n\nFor any other account setups that have transactions, Stripe wonâ€™t issue a 1099-K\nto your connected accounts (for example, when `controller.fees.payer` =\n`application_custom` or `application_express` or `application` where you pay the\nprocessing fees). Instead, consider issuing a [Form\n1099](https://support.stripe.com/questions/1099-tax-reporting-and-filing-for-platforms-and-marketplaces)\nto report income and payment transactions. There are several types of 1099\nforms, and the applicable form depends on the type of payments you make to your\nconnected account.\n\n#### Note\n\nStripe recommends that you consult a tax advisor to determine your tax filing\nand reporting requirements.\n\n## 1099-NEC\n\nUse the\n[1099-NEC](https://support.stripe.com/questions/intro-to-1099-nec-tax-forms-for-platforms-and-marketplaces)\nform to report non-employee compensation.\n\nThe account must meet all of the following criteria in the previous calendar\nyear:\n\n- Based in the US or a US taxpayer\n- $600 or more in payments\n\n## 1099-MISC\n\nUse the\n[1099-MISC](https://support.stripe.com/questions/intro-to-1099-misc-tax-forms-for-platforms-and-marketplaces)\nform to report other forms of payments made in the course of your business.\n\nThe account must meet all of the following criteria in the previous calendar\nyear:\n\n- Based in the US or a US taxpayer\n- $600 or more in payments or $10 in royalties\n\n## 1099-K\n\nUse the\n[1099-K](https://support.stripe.com/questions/intro-to-1099-k-tax-forms-for-platforms-and-marketplaces)\nform to report payment transactions.\n\nThe account must meet all of the following criteria in the previous calendar\nyear:\n\n- Based in the US or a US taxpayer\n- More than $5,000 in gross volume\n- More than 0 transactions\n\n## See also\n\n- [Get started with the Stripe 1099 tax reporting\nproduct](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-tax-reporting)\n- [Configure your tax form\nsettings](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/tax-form-settings)\n\n#### Note\n\nLooking for help calculating sales tax, VAT, or GST?
