If you currently integrate with ACH Credit Transfer payments using the\nSources API, you must [migrate to the Payment Methods\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/transitioning). We’ll send\nemail communications with more information about this end of support.\n\nFor information about migrating to USD Bank Transfer supported by the current\nAPIs, refer to the documentation below.\n\n## Reasons to migrate\n\nThe bank transfers payment method adds many improvements compared to [ACH Credit\nTransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/sources/ach-credit-transfer). It’s compatible\nwith Stripe [PaymentIntents](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents),\nsupports [Stripe Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout), and the\nPayment Element, and takes less effort to operate, reconcile, and refund.\n\n### Impact of not migrating\n\nStripe plans to disable support for payment methods in the Sources API. If you\nhandle any payment methods using the Sources API, you must migrate them to the\nPayment Methods API. We’ll provide further information about this end of support\nthrough email.\n\n### Impact on ACH Credit Transfers customers\n\nWhen you migrate, Stripe keeps the same bank account information for customers\nwhen you add bank transfers, making the process seamless for them. If you don’t\nmigrate, customers can still send funds using the legacy ACH Credit Transfer\nproduct.\n\n## Credit transfers versus Bank transfers\n\nThe following table details the differences between the new bank transfers\npayment method and ACH Credit Transfers:\n\nFeatureACH Credit TransferBank transfers[Checkout\nSupport](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bank-transfers/accept-a-payment?payment-ui=stripe-hosted)No\nYes [Payment Element\nSupport](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bank-transfers/accept-a-payment?payment-ui=elements)No\nYes [Dynamic payment methods\nsupport](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/dynamic-payment-methods)No\nYes RefundsRequire customer actionPartially automatedFunds land inSource[Cash\nbalance](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/customer-balance)APISourcesPayment\nIntentsUnreconciled balancesMoved to your balanceReturned to the customer\n### How Stripe migrates objects to support bank transfers\n\nWhen you activate bank transfers, Stripe automatically enables your customer\nobjects to support the new cash balance, one of the primary features of the bank\ntransfers product.\n\n- For a customer with no attached Credit Transfer Sources, Stripe provisions a\nnew virtual account number for the cash balance.\n- For a customer with attached Credit Transfer Sources, Stripe consumes the\nCredit Transfer Source object and moves the full remaining amount into the\ncustomer’s cash balance. See new transfers sent by the customer to the Source\nbank account number in the customer’s cash balance instead. The virtual account\nnumber stays consistent throughout the migration process, and you don’t need to\ncommunicate any new destinations to the customer. Single customers are\nautomatically migrated after you perform one of the following actions:- Request\nof [Customer Balance Funding\nInstructions](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/customer-balance/funding-instructions)\n(recommended if you’re upgrading your integration)\n- Confirmation of a `customer_balance` Payment Intent\n- Creation of an invoice or subscription using bank transfers\n- For [test mode](https://docs.stripe.com/test-mode) customers, [simulation of a\nfunding\ntransaction](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bank-transfers/accept-a-payment#test-your-integration)\n- After the migration process is complete, it’s no longer possible to delete the\ncustomer. In return, we guarantee that funds sent to the virtual account at any\npoint in the future are added to the correct customer cash balance.\n\n## Migrating your Connect integration\n\nIf your Connect platform integrates with Standard connected accounts using ACH\nCredit Transfers, follow the steps in the [Connect integration\nguide](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/customer-balance/standard-connect-migration).\n\n## Migrating for Invoicing or Billing\n\nIf you’re using ACH Credit Transfer payments with Invoicing or Billing and want\nto migrate, follow the steps in the [Invoicing migration\nguide](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/customer-balance/invoicing-migration).\n\n## Migration for a direct integration with the Sources or Charges API\n\nIf you’re using ACH Credit Transfers using the Sources API, follow the steps in\nthe [Sources migration\nguide](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/customer-balance/direct-sources-migration).\n\n## Links\n\n- [migrate to the Payment Methods\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/transitioning)\n- [ACH Credit Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/sources/ach-credit-transfer)\n- [PaymentIntents](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents)\n- [Stripe Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout)\n- [Checkout\nSupport](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bank-transfers/accept-a-payment?payment-ui=stripe-hosted)\n- [Payment Element\nSupport](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bank-transfers/accept-a-payment?payment-ui=elements)\n- [Dynamic payment methods\nsupport](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/dynamic-payment-methods)\n- [Cash balance](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/customer-balance)\n- [Customer Balance Funding\nInstructions](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/customer-balance/funding-instructions)\n- [test mode](https://docs.stripe.com/test-mode)\n- [simulation of a funding\ntransaction](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bank-transfers/accept-a-payment#test-your-integration)\n- [configured with\nproperties](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/update-to-typeless-connect)\n- [Connect integration\nguide](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/customer-balance/standard-connect-migration)\n- [Invoicing migration\nguide](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/customer-balance/invoicing-migration)\n- [Sources migration\nguide](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/customer-balance/direct-sources-migration)",
