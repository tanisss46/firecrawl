# Stripe Capital eligibility

## Learn more about our offer eligibility criteria.

Stripe determines your eligibility for a financing offer based on a variety of
factors related to your Stripe accounts, including your processing volume and
the size of your customer base.

We automatically review your business for financing offer eligibility on a daily
basis. If you become eligible, you’ll receive an email and you can view your
offer in the Dashboard under the [Capital
tab](https://dashboard.stripe.com/capital).

You might see a banner in the Stripe Dashboard that indicates that you’re on
track for a future offer. This isn’t a guarantee of a future offer or of
specific terms and doesn’t reflect a decision or evaluation.

#### Note

If your business has multiple Stripe accounts, a financing offer might be
generated based on the combined information from those accounts. Changes to one
account without corresponding updates to others might affect your financing
eligibility. This includes changes to your business name, Employee
Identification Number (EIN), and business address.

## Minimum eligibility requirements

To qualify for a financing offer through Stripe Capital, your business must:

- Have processed payments on Stripe for 3 months or more.
- Have a processing volume of 5,000 USD minimum per year and an average
processing volume of USD 1,000 for the last 3 months.
- Be in good standing with Stripe Capital. If your business previously applied
for a Capital offer and was rejected, you’re not eligible to receive a new offer
for 30 days.
- Be based in the US. The Stripe Capital program only supports businesses
located or incorporated in the US. Business representatives must also provide a
physical US home address.
- Certain geographic limitations may apply. Funding might not be available in
certain states due to local rules and regulations.

#### Note

Meeting the minimum eligibility requirements doesn’t guarantee that your
business qualifies for a Stripe Capital offer, or will be approved at
application.

## Important factors we consider

In addition to the minimum requirements, Capital’s underwriting models may
evaluate many other characteristics of your business to determine eligibility.
We’ve highlighted some key considerations:

- *A growing business.* How much you process through Stripe influences the size
of your financing offer. Businesses with positive growth trajectories are more
likely to be eligible for an offer.
- *A steady processing record.* A consistent, steady processing record with
limited periods of low or zero volume shows stability in your business and
increases your likelihood of qualifying for an offer.
- *A large customer base.* Businesses with more customers are more likely to be
eligible for an offer.
- *A low dispute rate.* Businesses with low rates of unresolved chargebacks are
more likely to qualify for funding.

## Additional steps you can take

The more information we can see about the health of your business, the better we
can evaluate your eligibility for a Capital offer.

- *Connect your business bank account.* Securely [linking your bank
account](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/linked-external-accounts)
lets Stripe view your bank balances and transactions to better determine your
eligibility for an offer.
- *Bring more processing volume onto Stripe.* Our underwriting model is based on
the payment volume that you process on Stripe. Shifting transaction volume from
other payment sources onto Stripe increases your overall Stripe processing
volume and improves your likelihood of receiving an offer.
