In your Dashboard, you can filter the\n[accounts\noverview](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard/viewing-all-accounts) based\non the fraud risk score. The Home page also alerts you to potentially fraudulent\nconnected accounts.\n\n## Investigate a connected account\n\nIn your Dashboard, you can view the following information in the connected\naccount details page:\n\n- The fraud risk score of the connected account\n- Potential fraud indicators, which provide you with suggestions for potential\nareas to investigate further\n- Risk-related metrics, such as declines, disputes, and refunds, specific to\nthat connected account\n\n## Gather additional information\n\nTo gather more information on the connected account, you can ask to verify a\ngovernment-issued ID document and, optionally, a selfie. When you do so, you\nalso set an enforcement that automatically occurs if the connected account\ndoesnâ€™t successfully complete the verification. This enforcement can either be\nto pause payouts only, or to pause both payouts and payments. This enforcement\ncan occur either after a certain period of time or after a certain total\nlifetime volume.\n\n## Take action\n\nYou can pause payments, pause payouts, or reject a connected account using the\nAPI or the Dashboard.\n\n## Request early access\n\n## Interested in getting early access to merchant risk tooling?\n\nMerchant risk tooling is currently in private preview.
