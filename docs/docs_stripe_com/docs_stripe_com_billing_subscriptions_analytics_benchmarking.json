Review your preset filters to understand your\nposition relative to your peers, then experiment with different filter\ncombinations based on what you want to learn. Look for consistent patterns\nacross months to distinguish trends from anomalies, and use this information to\nmake strategic decisions about customer acquisition, retention, and expansion.\n\n## Filters\n\nUse filters to customize your benchmarks and compare your company’s performance\nagainst businesses with similar customer bases, growth stages, and subscriber\nvalues.\n\nAdjust the following filters to view different market segments and identify\nbenchmarks that you want to achieve:\n\n- **ARR**: Annual Recurring Revenue buckets. This filter is preset based on your\nbusiness profile.\n- **ARPU**: Average Revenue Per User buckets.\n- **Business model**: B2B, B2C, or both.\n\n## Chart descriptions\n\nThe Dashboard presents four key metrics as 12-month trends:\n\n- **MRR Growth Rate**: This shows your revenue expansion pace, with higher\npositive values indicating faster growth.\n- **Subscriber Lifetime Value (LTV)**: This represents the total expected\nrevenue from a customer, with higher values suggesting more valuable\nrelationships.\n- **Net MRR Churn Rate**: This measures revenue retention, with lower or\nnegative values being better.\n- **Subscriber Churn Rate**: This indicates customer retention, where lower\nvalues are preferable.\n\nThe chart shows your business metrics compared to the top, median, and bottom\ntrends of at least 500 similar businesses based on your filter selection. Hover\nover the chart to see detailed comparisons at specific intervals in the\ntimeline.\n\n### Chart pattern analysis\n\nTo help you understand and analyze the information in the charts, consider the\nfollowing:\n\n- High MRR growth along with high net MRR churn suggests rapid customer\nacquisition but retention problems.\n- Low subscriber churn with high net MRR churn might indicate customer\ndowngrades.\n- Rising LTV with decreasing churn rates suggests that your customer\nsatisfaction is improving and your retention strategies might be working.\n- High MRR growth with stagnant LTV might indicate acquiring too many\nlower-value customers.\n\n## Links\n\n- [benchmarking](https://dashboard.stripe.com/billing/benchmarking)",
