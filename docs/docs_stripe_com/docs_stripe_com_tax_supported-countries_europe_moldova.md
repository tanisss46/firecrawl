# Collect tax in Moldova

## Learn how to use Stripe Tax to calculate, collect, and report tax in Moldova.

In Moldova, Stripe only supports collecting VAT for services provided through
electronic networks. In Stripe, these are referred to as “digital products.” To
collect this tax on Stripe, you must be a remote seller without a physical
presence in the country.

## When to register for tax collection

See [Thresholds](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/thresholds) to get insights
about your potential tax registration obligations in Moldova. Stripe also
notifies you with email and Dashboard alerts when you need to register to
collect tax. Learn more about how the [monitoring tool
works](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/monitoring).

Remote sellers selling services provided through electronic networks (digital
products) to individuals in Moldova have to register for tax from their first
sale there. Sales to business customers in Moldova don’t trigger any tax
registration obligations because non-resident businesses aren’t required to
collect tax on these sales.

- **Threshold**: 1 transaction
- **Included transactions**: Business-to-consumer (B2C) sales of digital goods
or electronically supplied services (digital products)

## Register to collect tax

## How we calculate taxes

We only support calculations for [digital
products](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes?type=digital) (non-physical
items or services that are delivered, given, or rendered electronically) in
Moldova. Stripe doesn’t calculate tax for products that don’t use a digital
product tax code.

View the list of supported [digital product tax
codes](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes?type=digital). To calculate taxes
in Moldova, make sure that you [assign a tax
code](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/products-prices-tax-codes-tax-behavior#tax-code-on-product)
to each of your products.

## Report and file your taxes

Stripe Tax has filing partners—Taxually, Marosa, and Hands-off Sales Tax
(HOST)—to help automate your tax filing. These partners automatically sync your
tax transaction data in real time, eliminating the need for manual data entry or
file transfers. Learn more about [tax
filing](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/filing).

Stripe also provides reports of your completed tax transactions. Go to
[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations) to access these
reports. Learn more about [the different types of
reports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports).
