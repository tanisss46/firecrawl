When you\ncreate a new customer, set up a [minimal customer\nprofile](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/customer#customer-profile) to help\ngenerate more useful invoices, and enable Smart Retries (if you’re an [Invoicing\nPlus](https://stripe.com/invoicing/pricing) user). After you set up your\ncustomer, you can issue one-off invoices or create\n[subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating).\n\n#### Caution\n\nBefore you create a new customer, make sure that the customer doesn’t already\nexist in the Dashboard. Creating multiple customer entries for the same customer\ncan cause you problems later on, such as when you need to reconcile transaction\nhistory or coordinate saved payment methods.\n\nDashboardAPI\nYou can create and manage customers on the [Customers\npage](https://dashboard.stripe.com/customers) when you don’t want to use code to\ncreate a customer, or if you want to manually bill a customer with a one-off\ninvoice.\n\n#### Note\n\nYou can also create a customer in the Dashboard during invoice creation.\n\n### Create a customer\n\nWhen you create a new customer, you can set their account and billing\ninformation, such as **Email**, **Name**, and **Country**. You can also set a\ncustomer’s preferred language, currency, and other important details.\n\nTo create a customer, complete these steps:\n\n- Verify that the customer doesn’t already exist.\n- Click **Add customer**, or press **N**, on the **Customers** page.\n- At a minimum, enter your customer’s **Name** and **Account email**.\n- Click **Add customer** in the dialog.\n\n### Edit a customer\n\nTo edit a customer’s profile, complete these steps:\n\n- Find the customer you want to modify and click the name on the **Customers**\npage.\n- In the account information page, select **Actions** > **Edit information**.\n- Make your changes to the customer profile.\n- Click **Update customer**.\n\n### Delete a customer\n\nTo delete a customer, complete these steps:\n\n- Find the customer you want to delete on the **Customers** page.\n- Click the checkbox next to your customer’s name followed by **Delete**. You\ncan also click into the customer’s details page and select **Actions** >\n**Delete customer**.\n\n## Customer profiles\n\n​​Use a basic customer profile for invoice and receipt generation or as a\nlightweight customer relationship management system (CRM) for your application.\nTo create a minimal customer profile, set these properties:\n\n- Email address.\n- Customer name.\n- Metadata with a reference to your application’s internal customer ID.\n\nStripe uses your customer’s [email\naddress](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-email) to\nnotify them of payment failures. Stripe also uses email addresses to notify\ncustomers when they need to perform an action to complete a payment.\n\nStore the internal customer ID for your application in the\n[metadata](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-metadata)\nattribute. Like most Stripe resources, the `Customer` resource includes a\n[Metadata](https://docs.stripe.com/api/metadata) object hash to flexibly store\ncontextual key-value information. To aid in auditing and support, store your\ninternal customer ID as a key-value pair on the `Customer` resource. This allows\nyou to search for the customer using your internal reference ID. We recommend\nstoring Stripe customer IDs against the internal customer model of your\napplication.\n\n### Billing and shipping addresses\n\nUse the [address\nattributes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-address)\nto set a billing address for invoicing and credit notes. For physical good\ndelivery, add a\n[shipping](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-shipping)\naddress.\n\n#### Note\n\nInvoices, credit notes, and receipts display the billing address—a common\nrequirement for tax compliance.\n\n### Email and PDF language localization\n\nWhen you create a customer, use the **Language** dropdown to add their preferred\nlanguage. (You can also add or edit a customer’s preferred language in the\n**Customer details** page or when creating an invoice.) Stripe uses the chosen\nlanguage to localize invoice emails and PDFs, receipt emails and PDFs, and\ncredit note PDFs.\n\nTo update the language through the API, use the\n[preferred_locales](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-preferred_locales)\nparameter. This parameter accepts an ordered list of preferred languages sorted\nby preference. These preferred locale values are based on\n[RFC-4646](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4646). Examples include en for\n, or fr-CA for Canadian French. To learn more, see [Customer preferred\nlanguages](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/customize#customer-language).\n\n## Customer properties\n\nThe following table contains additional customer properties:\n\nPropertyDescriptionPayment propertiesStripe uses the\n[payment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments) details associated with a customer\nto collect payment. A customer can have multiple ways to make a payment,\nincluding the [Payment Methods\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods) and [Customer credit\nbalance](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/customer/balance). Customers are\nsingle-currency, which means that after you assign a currency, invoice the\ncustomer, or set a customer credit balance, you can’t change the currency. You\ncan see this locked state in the Dashboard in a disabled Currency dropdown. If\nyou need to bill a single entity with multiple currencies, create a new customer\nfor each currency.Invoicing propertiesAll [invoicing-related\nresources](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/create#create_customer-invoice_settings)\nare associated with the billed customer.Tax propertiesTo meet tax jurisdiction\nrequirements, you might need to include customer tax ID numbers and other\ntax-related information on your invoices. ​​It’s your responsibility to make\nsure your customer’s invoices contain all of the correct information, such as\n[tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/customer/tax-ids), [tax exemption\nstatus](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/create#create_customer-tax_exempt),\nand [addresses](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/customer#addresses). Tax IDs\nprovide a way to store and render one or more tax ID numbers on invoices. The\ntax exemption status indicates whether the entity is taxable. By default, a\ncustomer’s `tax_exempt` status is set to `none`—meaning it’s a taxable billing\nentity. However, you can set the `tax_exempt` parameter to `reverse` for\ncustomers that must pay the invoice’s tax. You can also flag the customer as\nbeing tax exempt by setting the status to `exempt`. To learn more about using\n`tax_exempt` and `reverse`, see [Tax\nRates](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/taxes/tax-rates#tax-exempt-and-reverse-charge).\n## Common tasks\n\nHere are some of the common tasks you can perform with the `Customer` resource:\n\n- **Send an invoice to a customer**: After you create the customer, you can\n[send them an\ninvoice](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/dashboard#create-invoice).\n- **Store a customer credit balance**: The customer credit balance feature\nallows you to assign credit and debit adjustments to a specific customer and\nthen apply the resulting balance toward future invoices for them.\n- **Add and validate tax ID numbers**: Displaying a customer’s tax ID on an\ninvoice is a common requirement, and Stripe allows you to add multiple tax IDs\nto a customer. Their tax IDs display in the header of invoice and credit note\nPDFs. See the [Customer tax\nIDs](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/customer/tax-ids) page for more details.\n- **Add a coupon to a customer**: A\n[coupon](https://docs.stripe.com/api/coupons) contains information about a\npercent-off or amount-off discount, and Stripe Invoicing allows you to associate\na coupon with a customer. Coupons apply a discount to the invoice amount due, on\na pre-tax basis.\n- **Set the currency for a customer**: You can set the default currency to\ncharge a customer for invoices using the Dashboard by navigating to the\n**Customers** page, selecting your customer, and clicking **Edit** next to\n**Details**. See the [Multi-currency\ncustomers](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/multi-currency-customers) page for\nmore details on billing the same customer using a different currency than their\ndefault currency.\n- **Create customers in bulk**: Bulk upload Customers using [Productivity Stripe\nApps](https://marketplace.stripe.com/categories/productivity).\n\n## Links\n\n- [Invoicing Plus](https://stripe.com/invoicing/pricing)\n- [subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating)\n- [Customers page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/customers)\n- [email\naddress](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-email)\n-\n[metadata](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-metadata)\n- [Metadata](https://docs.stripe.com/api/metadata)\n- [address\nattributes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-address)\n-\n[shipping](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-shipping)\n-\n[preferred_locales](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-preferred_locales)\n- [RFC-4646](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4646)\n- [Customer preferred\nlanguages](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/customize#customer-language)\n- [payment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments)\n- [Payment Methods API](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods)\n- [Customer credit balance](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/customer/balance)\n- [invoicing-related\nresources](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/create#create_customer-invoice_settings)\n- [tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/customer/tax-ids)\n- [tax exemption\nstatus](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/create#create_customer-tax_exempt)\n- [Tax\nRates](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/taxes/tax-rates#tax-exempt-and-reverse-charge)\n- [send them an\ninvoice](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/dashboard#create-invoice)\n- [coupon](https://docs.stripe.com/api/coupons)\n- [Multi-currency\ncustomers](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/multi-currency-customers)\n- [Productivity Stripe\nApps](https://marketplace.stripe.com/categories/productivity)",
