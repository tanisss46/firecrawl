  "content": "# Supported currencies\n\n## See what currencies you can use for making charges and for paying out to your bank account.\n\nYou can charge customers in one of more than [135 native\ncurrencies](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#presentment-currencies) and\n[receive funds in your\ncurrency](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts#supported-accounts-and-settlement-currencies).\nBusinesses that have a global presence find this helpful because charging in a\ncustomer’s native currency can increase sales.\n\n## Currency presentment and settlement\n\nCurrency affects three aspects of Stripe payments:\n\n- The customer’s payment method currency, such as their credit card or bank\naccount\n- The currency of the charge, called the *presentment* currency\n- The currency accepted by your destination bank account or debit card, called\nthe *settlement* currency\n\nIf the charge currency differs from the customer’s payment method currency,\ntheir bank or card issuer might charge the *customer* a foreign exchange fee.\nThe bank or card issuer might also charge the customer if the payment method and\nyour business are in different countries, regardless of the currency used.\n\nIf the charge currency differs from your settlement currency, Stripe [converts\nthe charge](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies/conversions) to your settlement\ncurrency. Our [payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts#multiple-bank-accounts)\ndocumentation lists the different bank account currencies we support. See\n[Stripe pricing](https://www.stripe.com/pricing) for conversion costs.\n\n## Supported presentment currencies\n\nAustraliaAustriaBelgiumBrazilBulgariaCanadaCroatiaCyprusCzech\nRepublicDenmarkEstoniaFinlandFranceGermanyGibraltarGreeceHong\nKongHungaryIndiaIrelandItalyJapanLatviaLiechtensteinLithuaniaLuxembourgMalaysiaMaltaMexicoNetherlandsNew\nZealandNorwayPolandPortugalRomaniaSingaporeSlovakiaSloveniaSpainSwedenSwitzerlandThailandUnited\nArab EmiratesUnited KingdomUnited States\nStripe users can process charges in the following list of currencies with these\nexceptions:\n\n- UnionPay cards can only be charged in USD and CAD\n- Currencies marked with `*` are not supported by American Express\n- These currencies apply to card payments: other payment methods are often tied\nto a specific currency\n- USD\n- AED\n- AFN*\n- ALL\n- AMD\n- ANG\n- AOA*\n- ARS*\n- AUD\n- AWG\n- AZN\n- BAM\n- BBD\n- BDT\n- BGN\n- [BIF](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#zero-decimal)\n- BMD\n- BND\n- BOB*\n- BRL*\n- BSD\n- BWP\n- BYN\n- BZD\n- CAD\n- CDF\n- CHF\n- [CLP](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#zero-decimal)*\n- CNY\n- COP*\n- CRC*\n- CVE*\n- CZK\n- [DJF](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#zero-decimal)*\n- DKK\n- DOP\n- DZD\n- EGP\n- ETB\n- EUR\n- FJD\n- FKP*\n- GBP\n- GEL\n- GIP\n- GMD\n- [GNF](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#zero-decimal)*\n- GTQ*\n- GYD\n- HKD\n- HNL*\n- HTG\n- HUF\n- IDR\n- ILS\n- INR\n- ISK\n- JMD\n- [JPY](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#zero-decimal)\n- KES\n- KGS\n- KHR\n- [KMF](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#zero-decimal)\n- [KRW](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#zero-decimal)\n- KYD\n- KZT\n- LAK*\n- LBP\n- LKR\n- LRD\n- LSL\n- MAD\n- MDL\n- [MGA](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#zero-decimal)\n- MKD\n- MMK\n- MNT\n- MOP\n- MUR*\n- MVR\n- MWK\n- MXN\n- MYR\n- MZN\n- NAD\n- NGN\n- NIO*\n- NOK\n- NPR\n- NZD\n- PAB*\n- PEN*\n- PGK\n- PHP\n- PKR\n- PLN\n- [PYG](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#zero-decimal)*\n- QAR\n- RON\n- RSD\n- RUB\n- [RWF](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#zero-decimal)\n- SAR\n- SBD\n- SCR\n- SEK\n- SGD\n- SHP*\n- SLE\n- SOS\n- SRD*\n- STD*\n- SZL\n- THB\n- TJS\n- TOP\n- TRY\n- TTD\n- TWD\n- TZS\n- UAH\n- [UGX](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#zero-decimal)\n- UYU*\n- UZS\n- [VND](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#zero-decimal)\n- [VUV](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#zero-decimal)\n- WST\n- [XAF](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#zero-decimal)\n- XCD\n- [XOF](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#zero-decimal)*\n- [XPF](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#zero-decimal)*\n- YER\n- ZAR\n- ZMW\n\nYou must use all lowercase letters when passing the three-letter ISO code in any\npayment request.\n\nCurrencies shown as links are\n[zero-decimal](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#zero-decimal) currencies.\n\n## Minor units in API amounts\n\nAll API requests expect `amount` values in the [currency’s minor\nunit](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-amount).\nFor example, enter:\n\n- `1000` to charge 10 USD (or any other two-decimal currency).\n- `10` to charge 10 JPY (or any other zero-decimal currency).\n\n### Zero-decimal currencies\n\nFor the following zero-decimal currencies, the charge and the amount are the\nsame, without requiring multiplication. For example, to charge 500 JPY, provide\nan `amount` value of `500`.\n\n- BIF\n- CLP\n- DJF\n- GNF\n- JPY\n- KMF\n- KRW\n- MGA\n- PYG\n- RWF\n- UGX\n- VND\n- VUV\n- XAF\n- XOF\n- XPF\n\n### Special cases\n\nThe following currencies have special conditions that you need to consider when\ncreating payouts or charges.\n\nCurrency DescriptionIcelandic Króna (ISK)ISK transitioned to a zero-decimal\ncurrency, but backwards compatibility requires you to represent it as a\ntwo-decimal value, where the decimal amount is always `00`. For example, to\ncharge 5 ISK, provide an `amount` value of `500`. You can’t charge fractions of\nISK.Hungarian Forint (HUF)Stripe treats HUF as a zero-decimal currency for\npayouts, even though you can charge two-decimal amounts. When you create a\nmanual payout in HUF, you must provide integer amounts that are evenly divisible\nby 100. For example, if you have an available balance of HUF 10.45, you can pay\nout HUF 10 by submitting `1000` for the `amount` value. You can’t submit a\npayout for the full balance, HUF 10.45, because the `amount` value of `1045`\nisn’t evenly divisible by 100.New Taiwan Dollar (TWD)Stripe treats TWD as a\nzero-decimal currency for payouts, even though you can charge two-decimal\namounts. When you create a manual payout in TWD, you must provide integer\namounts that are evenly divisible by 100. For example, if you have an available\nbalance of TWD 800.45, you can pay out TWD 800 by submitting `80000` for the\n`amount` value. You can’t submit a payout for the full balance, TWD 800.45,\nbecause the `amount` value of `80045` isn’t evenly divisible by 100.Ugandan\nShilling (UGX)UGX transitioned to a zero-decimal currency, but backwards\ncompatibility requires you to represent it as a two-decimal value, where the\ndecimal amount is always `00`. For example, to charge 5 UGX, provide an `amount`\nvalue of `500`. You can’t charge fractions of UGX. For invoices where the\n`amount` is fractional after prorations, coupons, or taxes, Stripe automatically\nrounds that amount to the nearest number evenly divisible by 100. We credit or\ndebit any difference from rounding to the customer balance.\n## Minimum and maximum charge amounts\n\nStripe enforces a minimum payment amount for all charges to make sure the Stripe\nfee doesn’t exceed your charge. The minimum amount you can charge depends on the\npayout [bank account settlement\ncurrency](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts#supported-accounts-and-settlement-currencies).\n\nSubscription charges support zero-amount charges to account for coupons and free\ntrials. However, any non-zero amount is still subject to the applicable minimum.\n\nSettlement CurrencyMinimum Charge AmountUSD$0.50AED2.00\nد.إAUD$0.50BGNлв1.00BRLR$0.50CAD$0.50CHF0.50\nFrCZK15.00KčDKK2.50-kr.EUR€0.50GBP£0.30HKD$4.00HUF175.00\nFtINR₹0.50JPY¥50MXN$10MYRRM 2NOK3.00-kr.NZD$0.50PLN2.00\nzłRONlei2.00SEK3.00-kr.SGD$0.50THB฿10\nIf you only have one bank account, the minimum amount shown applies to all\ncharges in the same currency as the account. Charges requiring\n[conversion](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies/conversions) into your account’s\n[default settlement\ncurrency](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts#multiple-bank-accounts) must meet the\nequivalent minimum of the settlement currency. For example, if you have GBP and\nUSD bank accounts, with GBP set as your default currency, any non-USD charges\nyou create convert to GBP. These charges must meet the minimum amount required\nfor GBP (£0.30) after conversion.\n\nExceptions to the minimum charge amount apply to some payment methods, such as\n[iDEAL](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ideal) (allows `amount` values as low\nas `1`).\n\nIn general, the number of allowed digits limits the maximum amount you can\ncharge a customer. The `amount` value supports up to:\n\n- 12 digits for IDR, for a maximum charge of 9,999,999,999.99 IDR\n(`999999999999`)\n- 9 digits for INR, for a maximum charge of 9,999,999.99 INR (`999999999`)\n- 8 digits for all other currencies, for a maximum charge of 999,999.99\n(`99999999`)\n\nWhen accepting card payments, these currencies support higher maximum amounts:\n\n- 11 digits for LBP, for a maximum charge of 999,999,999,999 LBP\n(`99999999999999`)\n- 10 digits for COP, for a maximum charge of 9,999,999,999.9 COP\n(`9999999999999`)\n- 10 digits for HUF, for a maximum charge of 9,999,999,999 HUF (`9999999999999`)\n- 10 digits for JPY, for a maximum charge of 9,999,999,999 JPY (`9999999999999`)\n\nCard networks can impose charge amount limits that are more restrictive than\ndigit number.\n\n## European credit cards\n\nSome factors, like pricing, result in distinct treatment of credit cards from\nEurope compared to credit cards from other regions. Stripe defines European\ncards as cards issued in the following countries:\n\nCountry CodeCountryADAndorraATAustriaBEBelgiumBGBulgariaHRCroatiaCYCyprusCZCzech\nRepublicDKDenmarkEEEstoniaFOFaroe\nIslandsFIFinlandFRFranceDEGermanyGIGibraltarGRGreeceGLGreenlandGGGuernseyVAHoly\nSee (Vatican City State)HUHungaryISIcelandIEIrelandIMIsle of\nManILIsraelITItalyJEJerseyLVLatviaLILiechtensteinLTLithuaniaLULuxembourgMTMaltaMCMonacoNLNetherlandsNONorwayPLPolandPTPortugalRORomaniaPMSaint\nPierre and MiquelonSMSan\nMarinoSKSlovakiaSISloveniaESSpainSESwedenTRTürkiyeGBUnited Kingdom\n## See also\n\n- [Creating Payments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents)\n- [Getting Paid](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts)\n- [Currency Conversions](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies/conversions)\n\n## Links\n\n- [payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/payment-method-support#country-currency-support)\n- [activate it](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/activate#activation)\n- [receive funds in your\ncurrency](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts#supported-accounts-and-settlement-currencies)\n- [converts the charge](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies/conversions)\n- [payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts#multiple-bank-accounts)\n- [Stripe pricing](https://www.stripe.com/pricing)\n- [currency’s minor\nunit](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-amount)\n- [iDEAL](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ideal)\n- [Creating Payments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents)\n- [Getting Paid](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts)",
