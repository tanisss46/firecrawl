# Cards now use both the unchecked and unavailable values to describe address and CVC checks by issuing banksBreaking changes

## What’s new

Updates the `Card` object so a value of `unchecked` for the
`address_line1_check`, `address_zip_check`, or `cvc_check` properties means the
property hasn’t been checked. Previously, it meant the issuing bank didn’t
support the particular check. That state now shows as `unavailable`. Unchecked
properties are checked when a card is charged or added to a `Customer` object.

## Impact

This change allows you to more accurately understand the status of address and
CVC checks on a `Card` object.
