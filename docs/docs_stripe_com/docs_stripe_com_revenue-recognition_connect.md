# Revenue Recognition for Connect platformsPrivate preview

## Learn how Revenue Recognition works with Connect platforms.

You can collect application fees in three ways: [destination
charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges), [direct
charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges), and [separate charges
and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers).

Create destination charges on your platform account to take fees, then transfer
remaining funds to your connected accounts. Revenue Recognition recognizes the
revenue from the application fees.

Create direct charges to make charges directly on the connected account and take
fees in the process. Revenue Recognition recognizes the revenue from the
application fees.

Create separate charges and transfers to make charges on your platform account
on behalf of connected accounts, perform transfers separately, and retain funds
in the process. Revenue Recognition recognizes the revenue from the retained
funds.

Destination charges are available to all users. If youâ€™re interested in using
Revenue Recognition for direct charges or separate charges and transfers, please
