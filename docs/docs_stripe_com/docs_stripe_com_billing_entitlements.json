After you map your features, Stripe notifies you about when to\nprovision or de-provision access (according to your customer’s subscription\nstatus), and to what features, based on your mapping choices.\n\nUse Entitlements to:\n\n- Launch, change, and experiment with your pricing without needing to change\nyour codebase\n- Grant, revoke, and manage customer’s feature access\n- Simplify your billing integration\n\nStripe Billing Entitlements API demo\n\n## Before you begin\n\nThis guide assumes that you’re already using Stripe\n[Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/build-subscriptions)\nand [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/customer) resources.\n\nDashboardAPI\n## Get started\n\nTo get started with Entitlements:\n\n- **Set up your features**: Create each feature in Stripe Billing from the\nDashboard.

You can add a single feature to multiple products.\n- **Manage your features**: Edit or archive each feature from the Dashboard.\n[Set up your features](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/entitlements#setup)\nTo create a feature in the Dashboard, do the following:\n\n- In the Dashboard, go to the [Product\ncatalog](https://dashboard.stripe.com/products) and click **Features**.\n- Click **+ Create feature** and enter a Name and a Lookup Key for the feature.\nYou can optionally also add Metadata.\n- Because the Lookup Key is unique to each feature, you can’t reuse it across\ndifferent features unless you archive the feature associated with the Lookup\nKey.\n- Click **Create feature**.\n[Add your features to\nproducts](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/entitlements#assign)\nTo add a feature to a product in the Dashboard, do the following:\n\n- In the Dashboard, from the [Features](https://dashboard.stripe.com/features)\ntab, click the feature that you want to add.\n- Click **Attach to product** and select a product from the menu.\n- Click **Confirm**.\n\nWhen a customer subscribes to the product, you can view what features they’re\nentitled to.

You can’t edit a feature’s Lookup Key after the\nfeature is created.\n\n### Remove a feature from a product\n\nTo remove a feature from a product, go to the\n[Features](https://dashboard.stripe.com/features) tab and select the feature.\nThen click the overflow menu () next to the product name and click **Remove\nproduct**.\n\n### Archive a feature\n\nTo archive a feature, go to the\n[Features](https://dashboard.stripe.com/features) tab, click the overflow menu\n(), and click **Archive feature**.\n\nBefore you archive a feature, keep in mind the following:\n\n- Archived features can’t be edited or added to any new products.\n- Archived features still create entitlements if attached to existing products.\n- An archived feature’s lookup key can be used again.\n- You can’t unarchive a feature.\n\n## Links\n\n-\n[Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/build-subscriptions)\n- [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/customer)\n- [Product catalog](https://dashboard.stripe.com/products)\n- [Features](https://dashboard.stripe.com/features)\n- [Customers](https://dashboard.stripe.com/customers)",
