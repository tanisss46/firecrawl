## How we calculate taxes

Italy applies the EU VAT rules. Learn more about [tax calculation in the
European Union](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/european-union).

In Italy, the Vatican City is outside of the scope of the standard tax system
and might have different rules that apply. Stripe won’t calculate tax for
customers based there, even if you’ve added a registration for Italy. Learn more
about how Stripe handles [excluded
territories](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/zero-tax?#excluded-territories).

## Report and file your taxes

Stripe Tax has filing partners—Taxually, Marosa, and Hands-off Sales Tax
(HOST)—to help automate your tax filing. These partners automatically sync your
tax transaction data in real time, eliminating the need for manual data entry or
file transfers. Learn more about [tax
filing](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/filing).

Stripe also provides reports of your completed tax transactions. Go to
[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations) to access these
reports. Learn more about [the different types of
reports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports).
