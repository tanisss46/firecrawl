Use it to let your customers\nmanage their billing information, subscriptions, and invoices as your business\nscales.\n\nStripe hosts the customer portal, which means you can use it even if you don’t\nhave a website. You can also link users to it from an existing site or Stripe\nintegration.\n\nFirst, you need a Stripe account. [Register\nnow](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register/).\n\n[Create a\nproduct](https://docs.stripe.com/no-code/customer-portal#create-product)\nTo create a product in the Dashboard:\n\n- Go to **More** > **Product catalog**.\n- Click **+Add product**.\n- Enter the **Name** of your product.\n- *(Optional)* Add a **Description**. The description appears at checkout, on\nthe [customer portal](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management), and in\n[quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/quotes).\n- *(Optional)* Add an **Image** of your product. Use a JPEG, PNG, or WEBP file\nthat’s smaller than 2MB. The image appears at checkout.\n- *(Optional)* If you’re using [Stripe Tax](https://docs.stripe.com/tax), select\na **Tax code** for your product. See [tax\ncodes](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes) for more information about the\nappropriate category for your product.\n- *(Optional)* Enter a **Statement descriptor**. This descriptor overrides any\naccount descriptors for recurring payments. Choose something that your customers\nwould recognize on a bank statement.\n- *(Optional)* Enter a **Unit label**. This describes how you sell your product.\nFor example, if you charge by the seat, enter “seat” so the line item includes\n“per seat” for the price. Unit labels appear at checkout, and in invoices,\nreceipts, and the [customer\nportal](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/customer-portal).\n\nFor more details about [get started with products and\nprices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/getting-started).\n\n[Set up the customer\nportal](https://docs.stripe.com/no-code/customer-portal#set-up-customer-portal)-\n**Activate a customer portal link** On the [customer portal\nconfiguration](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/portal) page, click\n**Activate link** in the **Ways to get started** section.\n- **Configure the portal** Go to the [customer portal\nconfiguration](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/portal) page and\nselect your configuration options. Learn more about [configuration\noptions](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management/configure-portal).\n- **Share the portal login link** Add the link you activated to your site, or\nsend it directly to your customers. They can log in to the portal with their\nemail address and a one-time passcode.\n\nMake sure your customers have an\n[email](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-email) set.\nIf multiple customers have the same email address, Stripe selects the most\nrecently created customer that has both that email and an active subscription.\n\nFor security purposes:\n\n- Customers can’t update their email address through this link.\n- If a customer doesn’t receive a one-time passcode after clicking the login\nlink, make sure their email address matches the email address of an existing\ncustomer. To check, enter the email address in the search bar of your [Stripe\ndashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/).\n[OptionalCustomize\nbranding](https://docs.stripe.com/no-code/customer-portal#branding)[OptionalPrefill\ncustomer email](https://docs.stripe.com/no-code/customer-portal#url-parameters)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Stripe Billing pricing](https://stripe.com/billing/pricing)\n- [Invoicing pricing](https://stripe.com/invoicing/pricing)\n- [Register now](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register/)\n- [customer portal](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management)\n- [quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/quotes)\n- [Stripe Tax](https://docs.stripe.com/tax)\n- [tax codes](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes)\n- [customer\nportal](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/customer-portal)\n- [get started with products and\nprices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/getting-started)\n- [customer portal\nconfiguration](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/portal)\n- [configuration\noptions](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management/configure-portal)\n- [email](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-email)\n- [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/)",
