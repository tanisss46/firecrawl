[Register\nnow](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register).\n\nAccess the Stripe API from your application using our official libraries:\n\n```\n# Available as a gem\nsudo gem install stripe\n```\n\n```\n# If you use bundler, you can add this line to your Gemfile\ngem 'stripe'\n```\n\n[Getting permission to save a South Korean\ncardServer-side](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/kr-card/set-up-future-payments#web-permissions)\nYou need permission to save your customer’s payment method for future use.\nCreating an agreement (sometimes called a mandate) up front allows you to save\nyour customer’s payment details and charge them when they’re not actively using\nyour website or app.\n\nAdd terms to your website or app that state how you plan to save your customer’s\npayment method details, and let them opt in. If you plan to charge your customer\nwhen they’re offline, make sure that your terms also include the following:\n\n- The customer’s permission for you to initiate a payment or a series of\npayments on their behalf for specified transactions\n- The anticipated frequency (one-time or recurring) and timing of payments\n- How you determine the payment amount\n- Your cancellation policy (if you’re setting up the payment method for a\nsubscription service)\n\nMake sure that you keep a record of your customer’s written agreement to these\nterms, and only submit charges in accordance with the agreed terms.\n\n[Create or retrieve a\nCustomerServer-side](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/kr-card/set-up-future-payments#web-create-customer)\nTo save a South Korean card for future payments, attach it to a\n[Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers).\n\nCreate a [Customer object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers) when your\ncustomer creates an account with your business, and associate the ID of the\nCustomer object with your own internal representation of that customer.\nAlternatively, you can create a new Customer before saving a payment method for\nfuture payments.\n\nCreate a new Customer or retrieve an existing Customer to associate with this\npayment. Include the following code on your server to create a new Customer:\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n --data-urlencode description=\"My First Test Customer (created for API docs)\"\n```\n\n[Create a Checkout\nSessionServer-side](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/kr-card/set-up-future-payments#web-create-checkout-session)\nAdd a checkout button to your website that calls a server-side endpoint to\ncreate a [Checkout Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions).\n\n```\n<html>\n <head>\n <title>Checkout</title>\n </head>\n <body>\n <form action=\"/create-checkout-session\" method=\"POST\">\n <button type=\"submit\">Checkout</button>\n </form>\n </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nCreate a Checkout Session in `setup` mode to collect the required information.\nAfter creating the Checkout Session, redirect your customer to the\n[URL](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object#checkout_session_object-url)\nthat the response returns.\n\n```\nStripe::Checkout::Session.create({\n mode: 'setup',\n payment_method_types: ['card'],\n payment_method_types: ['card', 'kr_card'],\n customer: customer.id,\n success_url: 'https://example.com/success',\n cancel_url: 'https://example.com/cancel',\n})\n```\n\n[Test your\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/kr-card/set-up-future-payments#web-test-integration)\nWhen testing your Checkout integration, select **Local card** and click Pay. You\nwill be redirected to a Stripe-hosted page where you can choose to authorize or\nfail the payment.
