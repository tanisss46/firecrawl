# Removes the tax_percent attributeBreaking changes

## What’s new

Removes `tax_percent` from objects and requests in favor of [tax
rates](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_rates).

## Impact

Lets you manage taxation more flexibly by using the dedicated Tax Rates API
instead of the previously available `tax_percent` property.
