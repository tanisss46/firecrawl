Read more about registering for\n[sales tax in the US in our\nguide](https://stripe.com/guides/sales-tax-registration-process-us). You can\nalso use [Stripe to\nregister](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/use-stripe-to-register) on your behalf.\n\nAfter you’ve registered to collect tax in Illinois, go to\n[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations?location=us-il)\nto add your registrations to Stripe in the Dashboard. This turns on tax\ncalculation and collection in Stripe for your transactions in Illinois.\n\nLearn [how to add your\nregistration](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/registering#track-your-registrations-in-the-tax-dashboard)\nin the Dashboard.\n\n## How we calculate taxes\n\nIf your [origin address](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/set-up#origin-address) is\nin the US and differs from your customer’s state, Stripe always calculates tax\nbased on your customer’s location.\n\nIf your customer is in Illinois and your origin address is also in Illinois,\nStripe applies tax based on your origin address, depending on the type of\nproduct or service you sell.\n\nStripe still applies tax based on your origin address, if the following are all\ntrue:\n\n- Your customer is in Illinois\n- Your origin address is in Illinois\n- Your goods [ship\nfrom](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/calculating#how-to-use-ship-from-addresses) a\nlocation outside Illinois\n\nEven if the origin address in Illinois doesn’t perform selling activities, as\ndefined by Illinois tax law, Stripe can’t determine the activities performed at\neach address. This means Stripe defaults to the Illinois address as\nparticipating in the sale.\n\n## Report and file your taxes\n\nStripe provides reports of your completed tax transactions. Go to\n[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations) to access these\nreports.\n\n### Exports\n\nThe tax transaction data export provides a comprehensive and aggregated view of\ntransactions by location, including a breakdown of individual tax amounts. Learn\nmore about [tax reporting exports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports#exports).\n\n### Location reports\n\n[Location reports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports#us-location-reports)\noffer a summary of transaction and refund data for specific US locations and\nalign with Illinois filing requirements. You have the option to report on an\nannual, quarterly, or monthly basis.\n\nReporting-specific considerations:\n\n- The location reports don’t include transactions with Bloomington Amusement\ntax, Chicago Lease Tax, Chicago Amusement tax, East Dundee Amusement tax,\nEvanston Amusement tax, or Schiller Park Streaming Surcharge as these are filed\nto the local jurisdiction using a different report. To see transactions with\nthese taxes, you can use the\n[exports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports#exports).\n\n### Filing\n\nStripe Tax has filing partners—Taxually, Marosa, and Hands-off Sales Tax\n(HOST)—to help automate your tax filing.
