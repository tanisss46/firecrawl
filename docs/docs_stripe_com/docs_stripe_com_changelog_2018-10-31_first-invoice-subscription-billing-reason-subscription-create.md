# The billing_reason of the first invoice of a subscription is now subscription_createBreaking changes

## What’s new

The `billing_reason` attribute of the `Invoice` object can now take the value of
`subscription_create`, indicating that it’s the first invoice of a subscription.
For older API versions, `billing_reason=subscription_create` is represented as
`subscription_update`.

## Impact

This change introduces a new value, `subscription_create`, for the
`billing_reason` attribute of `Invoice` objects, specifically identifying
first-time subscription invoices. You can now distinguish between initial
subscription invoices and regular updates, enabling more precise tracking and
reporting of subscription lifecycles.
