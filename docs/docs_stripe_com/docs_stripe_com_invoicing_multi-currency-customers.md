# Multi-currency customers

## Change the billable currency for any customer to accept multiple currencies.

Use the Invoicing API to issue an invoice to a customer in a different currency.
With the multi-currency customers feature, you can bill the same
[Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers) using a different currency
than what’s set as their default currency, and change the currency for a
customer’s subscriptions. You can’t have two active subscriptions with different
currencies.

This guide also explains how to create a credit note and inspect a customer’s
credit balance in all assigned currencies. For illustrative purposes, we use the
Canadian Dollar (CAD).

## Create an invoice

Before you invoice a customer, create an invoice item by passing in the customer
`id`, `amount`, and `currency`. Only add invoice items to a single customer at a
time to avoid adding them to the wrong one.

The maximum number of invoice items is 250. Creating an invoice adds up to 250
pending invoice items with the remainder to be added on the next invoice. To see
your customer’s pending invoice items, see the **Customer details** page or set
the
[pending](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoiceitems/list#list_invoiceitems-pending)
attribute to `true` when you use the API to list all of the invoice items.

#### Note

A CAD invoice doesn’t apply a customer credit balance denominated in USD or any
other currency other than CAD. Additionally, any amount-off coupons you applied
to the customer that are denominated in non-CAD currency are ignored.

```
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/invoiceitems \
 -u "sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:" \
 -d customer={{CUSTOMER_ID}} \
 -d amount=1000 \
 -d currency=cad
```

You must pass in the `currency` parameter when you issue a multi-currency
invoice. The `currency` parameter dictates which invoice items get pulled into
the invoice. For example, if you were to create two invoice items—one in USD and
the other in CAD—for the same customer, setting the currency to CAD would only
pull in the CAD invoice item (ignoring the USD invoice item).

```
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/invoices \
 -u "sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:" \
 -d customer={{CUSTOMER_ID}} \
 -d collection_method=send_invoice \
 -d days_until_due=30 \
 -d pending_invoice_items_behavior=include \
 -d currency=cad
```

## Create a credit note

If there’s an issue with the invoice, you can create a credit note. If you need
to apply the credit to the customer’s credit balance (as opposed to back to the
original payment method), Stripe allocates the credit amount to the CAD-specific
credit balance.

```
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/credit_notes \
 -u "sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:" \
 -d invoice={{INVOICE_ID}} \
 -d reason=duplicate \
 -d amount=1000 \
 -d credit_amount=1000
```

## Inspect the credit balance

To see how much credit a customer has in each currency, use the
`invoice_credit_balance` parameter:

```
curl -G https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers/{{CUSTOMER_ID}} \
 -u "sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:" \
 -d "expand[]"=invoice_credit_balance
```

The customer’s credit balance is drawn down from the next CAD invoice created
for this customer. It won’t, however, be drawn down for invoices created in
different currencies.
