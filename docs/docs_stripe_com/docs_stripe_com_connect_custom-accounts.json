  "content": "# Using Connect with Custom connected accounts\n\n## Use Custom connected accounts with Connect to control your connected accounts' entire experience.\n\n#### Note\n\nIdentity verification requirements are updated as laws and regulations change\naround the world. If you’re building your own onboarding flow to onboard\naccounts, you must plan on reviewing and updating onboarding requirements at\nleast every six months. To avoid this maintenance obligation, use [Connect\nOnboarding for Custom\nAccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding).\n\nA *Custom* connected account is almost completely invisible to the account\nholder. You, the platform, are responsible for all interactions with your\nconnected accounts and for collecting all the information needed to verify each\naccount.\n\nWith Custom connected accounts, you can modify the connected account’s details\nand settings through the API, including managing their bank accounts and\n[payout](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts) schedule. Since Custom connected\naccount holders can’t log into Stripe, it’s up to you to build the onboarding\nflow, connected account dashboard, reporting functionality, and communication\nchannels.\n\nCreating a Custom connected account involves the following steps:\n\n- Make sure you meet the [minimum\nrequirements](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom-accounts#requirements).\n- Properly identify the\n[country](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom-accounts#country) and any\nrelated requirements.\n- [Create](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom-accounts#create) the account.\n- Complete the [identity\nverification](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom-accounts#identity-verification)\nprocess.\n\n#### Note\n\nTo comply with French PSD2 regulations, platforms in France [must use account\ntokens](https://stripe.com/guides/frequently-asked-questions-about-stripe-connect-and-psd2#regulatory-status-of-connect).\nAn additional benefit of tokens is that the platform doesn’t have to store PII\ndata, which is transferred from the connected account directly to Stripe. For\nplatforms in other countries, we recommend using account tokens, but they aren’t\nrequired.\n\n## Requirements for creating Custom connected accounts\n\nTo use Custom connected accounts, you must meet all of these requirements:\n\n- **Minimum API version**: You must be using an API version at least as recent\nas 2014-12-17. You can [view and\nupgrade](https://dashboard.stripe.com/workbench) your API version in the\nDashboard if needed.\n- **Terms of Service update**: Creating Custom connected accounts requires an\n[update to your terms of\nservice](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/updating-service-agreements#tos-acceptance),\nas it must include a reference to Stripe’s services agreement. Stripe recommends\nthat you consult with your attorneys on whether you should update your terms\nacceptance language to include reference to Stripe’s terms.\n- **Handling information requests**: Instead of requesting information—such as a\nSocial Security Number or passport scan—directly from your connected account\nuser, Stripe requests the information it needs from you. You must collect that\ninformation from your connected account and provide it to Stripe. Otherwise,\nStripe might disable payouts to the connected account.\n- **Platform in a supported country**: Platforms in Australia, Austria, Belgium,\nBrazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland,\nFrance, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan,\nLatvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand,\nNorway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden,\nSwitzerland, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United States can create\nCustom accounts for any country [Stripe supports](https://stripe.com/global).\n[Contact us](mailto:connect@stripe.com) to be notified when platforms in your\ncountry can use Custom connected accounts.\n- **Countries that don’t support self-serve**: Due to restrictions that apply\nwhen using Connect in the [United Arab\nEmirates](https://support.stripe.com/questions/connect-availability-in-the-uae),\n[India](https://support.stripe.com/questions/stripe-india-support-for-marketplaces),\nand\n[Thailand](https://support.stripe.com/questions/stripe-thailand-support-for-marketplace),\nplatform users in these countries can’t self-serve Custom connected accounts. To\nbegin onboarding for Custom connected accounts in these countries, [contact\nus](https://stripe.com/contact/sales).\n- **Platforms in the UAE**: Platforms in the UAE can only use Custom connected\naccounts based in the UAE with the following charge types:\n[destination_charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges) and\n[separate charges and\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers).\nDestination charges using the\n[on_behalf_of](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-on_behalf_of)\nattribute are not yet supported for UAE platforms.\n\n#### Caution\n\nPlatforms outside of Mexico that want to create Custom connected accounts in\nMexico and make them [settlement\nmerchants](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities#card-payments)\nrequire further review. [Contact us](https://support.stripe.com/contact) to\nstart the process.\n\n- **Vetting for fraud**: Because your platform is responsible for losses\nincurred by Custom connected accounts, you must scrutinize all accounts that\nsign up via your platform for potential fraud. Refer to our [risk management\nbest practices\nguide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/risk-management/best-practices) for more\ninformation.\n\nNote there’s an [additional cost](https://stripe.com/connect/pricing) for active\nCustom connected accounts. A Custom connected account is considered active if it\nhas received at least one successful payout in a given month.\n\n[Identify the country to\nuse](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom-accounts#country)\nThe only piece of information you need to create a Custom connected account is\nthe country where the individual or business primarily operates. You can collect\neverything else at a later time.\n\nFor example, if you’re in the United States and the business or individual\nyou’re creating a connected account for is legally represented in Canada, assign\n`CA` as the country.\n\nThe country value also determines the [required verification\ninformation](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information)\nfor the connected account.\n\n[Create a Custom connected\naccount](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom-accounts#create)\nThe basic process to create and connect a Custom connected account is to call\nthe account creation endpoint, setting `type` to `custom` and providing a\ncountry and the [appropriate\ncapabilities](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities#supported-capabilities).\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d country=US \\\n -d type=custom \\\n -d \"capabilities[card_payments][requested]\"=true \\\n -d \"capabilities[transfers][requested]\"=true\n```\n\n#### Caution\n\nUS platforms can create accounts for [cross-border\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities#transfers-cross-border)\nby [specifying the recipient service\nagreement](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/service-agreement-types#choosing-type-with-api).\n\nThe result of a successful API call is the connected account information:\n\n```\n{\n ...\n \"id\": \"{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}\",\n \"type\": \"custom\"\n ...\n}\n```\n\nStore the `id` in your database—it’s the account ID. You’ll provide this value\nto [authenticate](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/authentication) as the\nconnected account by passing it into requests in the `Stripe-Account` header.\n\n#### Note\n\nStore the received account ID. You need this information to perform requests on\nthe connected account’s behalf.\n\n[Start the identity verification\nprocess](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom-accounts#identity-verification)\nAn account created with only a country is fairly limited: it can only receive a\nsmall amount of funds. If you wish to enable payouts and keep the account in\ngood standing, you need to [provide more\ninformation](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/identity-verification) about the\naccount holder. The [required verification\ninformation](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information)\npage lists the minimum and likely identity verification requirements.\n\nThe easiest way to collect this information is to integrate [Connect\nOnboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding), which\nlets Stripe take care of the verification complexity. Otherwise, you must not\nonly write your own API calls for initial integration, but also continue to\ncheck for changing onboarding requirements because of changing regulations\naround the world.\n\nYou can collect required information when you [create the\naccount](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_account) or by [updating the\naccount](https://docs.stripe.com/api#update_account) later. At the very least,\nwe recommend collecting and providing the connected account user’s name and date\nof birth up front. If you collect [address\ninformation](https://support.stripe.com/questions/connect-address-validation)\nupfront, make sure to validate the state value for US, CA, and AU connected\naccounts in your onboarding flow.\n\n#### Note\n\nFor accounts with\n[business_type](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-business_type)\nset to `individual`, provide at least one `individual` property (for example,\n`individual.first_name`) and a\n[Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/object) object is created\nautomatically. If you don’t, or for accounts with the `business_type` set to\n`company`, you need to [create each\nPerson](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create) for the account.\n\n## Webhooks\n\nAfter an account is created, all notifications about changes to the account are\nsent to your [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/webhooks) as\n`account.updated` events. Provide your\n[Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)\n[webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) URL in your [account\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/webhooks) and then watch for\nthese events and respond to them as needed.\n\n## See also\n\nLearn more about working with Custom connected accounts.\n\n- [Onboarding custom\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/onboarding)\n- [Updating service\nagreements](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/updating-service-agreements)\n- [Identity verification](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/identity-verification)\n- [Authentication](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/authentication)\n- [Creating charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges)\n- [API reference](https://docs.stripe.com/api)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Connect Onboarding for Custom\nAccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding)\n- [payout](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts)\n- [must use account\ntokens](https://stripe.com/guides/frequently-asked-questions-about-stripe-connect-and-psd2#regulatory-status-of-connect)\n- [view and upgrade](https://dashboard.stripe.com/workbench)\n- [update to your terms of\nservice](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/updating-service-agreements#tos-acceptance)\n- [Stripe supports](https://stripe.com/global)\n- [United Arab\nEmirates](https://support.stripe.com/questions/connect-availability-in-the-uae)\n-\n[India](https://support.stripe.com/questions/stripe-india-support-for-marketplaces)\n-\n[Thailand](https://support.stripe.com/questions/stripe-thailand-support-for-marketplace)\n- [contact us](https://stripe.com/contact/sales)\n- [destination_charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges)\n- [separate charges and\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n-\n[on_behalf_of](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-on_behalf_of)\n- [settlement\nmerchants](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities#card-payments)\n- [Contact us](https://support.stripe.com/contact)\n- [risk management best practices\nguide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/risk-management/best-practices)\n- [additional cost](https://stripe.com/connect/pricing)\n- [required verification\ninformation](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information)\n- [appropriate\ncapabilities](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities#supported-capabilities)\n- [cross-border\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities#transfers-cross-border)\n- [specifying the recipient service\nagreement](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/service-agreement-types#choosing-type-with-api)\n- [authenticate](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/authentication)\n- [provide more\ninformation](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/identity-verification)\n- [create the account](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_account)\n- [updating the account](https://docs.stripe.com/api#update_account)\n- [address\ninformation](https://support.stripe.com/questions/connect-address-validation)\n-\n[business_type](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-business_type)\n- [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/object)\n- [create each Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)\n- [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/webhooks)\n- [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)\n- [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks)\n- [account settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/webhooks)\n- [Onboarding custom\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/onboarding)\n- [Updating service\nagreements](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/updating-service-agreements)\n- [Creating charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges)\n- [API reference](https://docs.stripe.com/api)",
