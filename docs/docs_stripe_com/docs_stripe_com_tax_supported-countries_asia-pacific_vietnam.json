This tax\nconsists of VAT and income tax. Stripe only supports collecting VAT for digital\nservices, which Stripe refers to as digital products. Stripe doesn’t calculate\nthe income tax component of the FCT.\n\n## When to register for tax collection\n\nSee [Thresholds](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/thresholds) to get insights\nabout your potential tax registration obligations in Vietnam. Stripe also\nnotifies you with email and Dashboard alerts when you need to register to\ncollect tax. Learn more about how the [monitoring tool\nworks](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/monitoring).\n\nRemote sellers providing digital goods or electronically supplied services\n(digital products) must register for tax from their first sale there. Sales to\nbusiness customers don’t trigger any tax registration obligations as remote\nsellers aren’t required to collect tax on those sales.\n\n- **Threshold**: 1 transaction\n- **Included transactions**: Sales of digital goods and services\n\n## Register to collect tax\n\nYou must be a remote seller with no physical presence in Vietnam to collect this\ntax on Stripe.\n\nFind more information on how to register for VAT in Vietnam on the [government\nwebsite](https://etaxvn.gdt.gov.vn/nccnn/Request).\n\nAfter you’ve registered to collect tax in Vietnam, go to\n[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations?location=vn) to\nadd your registrations to Stripe in the Dashboard.
