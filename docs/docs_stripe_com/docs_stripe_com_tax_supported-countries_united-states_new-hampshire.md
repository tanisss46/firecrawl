# Collect tax from New Hampshire

## Learn how to use Stripe Tax to calculate, collect, and report tax from New Hampshire.

## When to register for tax collection

New Hampshire doesn’t have a general state or local sales tax. This means you
won’t see an option to add your registration for New Hampshire to Stripe and
collect taxes from your customers based in New Hampshire.

However New Hampshire does impose other taxes on businesses, including a
business profits tax. Learn more about the taxes that apply in New Hampshire at
the [tax authority](https://www.revenue.nh.gov/assistance/tax-overview.htm).

If you’re a business based in New Hampshire you could still have tax obligations
based on sales to customers in other locations. See
[Thresholds](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/thresholds) to get insights about
your potential tax registration obligations. Stripe also notifies you with email
and Dashboard alerts when you need to register to collect tax. Learn more about
how the [monitoring tool works](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/monitoring).

## Register to collect tax

Read more about registering for [sales tax in the US in our
guide](https://stripe.com/guides/sales-tax-registration-process-us). You may
need to register to collect tax on your sales in other states or countries.

After you’ve registered to collect tax in a location, go to
[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations?location=us-nh)
to add your registrations to Stripe in the Dashboard. This turns on tax
calculation and collection in Stripe for your transactions in that location.

## Report and file your taxes

(HOST)—to help automate your tax filing. These partners automatically sync your
tax transaction data in real time, eliminating the need for manual data entry or
file transfers. Learn more about [tax
filing](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/filing).
