We automatically apply state thresholds when generating 1099 tax forms,\nso you can easily determine which forms need state filing based on the addresses\nof your connected accounts.\n\n#### Note\n\nStripe supports e-filing in all states but won’t transmit forms to states on\nyour behalf that have backup or state withholding amounts. Review [1099 form\nrequirements by\nstate](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/tax-forms-state-requirements#check-1099-form-requirements-by-state)\nand work with your tax advisor to make sure you understand the tax requirements\nspecific to your business.\n\n## Prepare to file with the states\n\nBefore filing forms in your Dashboard, do the following to make sure forms are\nfiled correctly with both the IRS and states:\n\n[Choose the tax form type in the\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/tax-forms-state-requirements#choose-form-type)\n[Configure your tax forms\nsettings](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-tax-reporting#set-tax-form-default-settings)\nto choose the tax form type (or types) you’ll file: 1099-K, 1099-NEC, or\n1099-MISC. Each state has different requirements for each form type.\n\n[Determine the states where your connected accounts are\nbased](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/tax-forms-state-requirements#determine-location)\nIn the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/taxes/forms), you can\neither [export](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/modify-tax-forms?method=csv) a\nCSV file with state information (reported in the **payee_region** column) or\nfilter by **Payee state**.\n\n![Filter by payee\nstate](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/payee_state.f077495dfbceb3bba62b27c5aee2bb9f.png)\n\n[Determine which states to file\nwith](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/tax-forms-state-requirements#determine-states)\nSome state 1099 filings also require a state tax registration or withholding ID.\nRefer to the tables in the [Check 1099 form requirements by\nstate](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/tax-forms-state-requirements#check-1099-form-requirements-by-state)\nsection to determine where you might need state online accounts and IDs.\n\n[Add the state tax Registration or withholding\nID](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/tax-forms-state-requirements#add-state-reg)\nAfter you obtain the registration or withholding ID, add the states in which\nyou’ll file and the corresponding IDs on the [Tax forms\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/tax_forms) page. In the\nDashboard, click **Settings**. On **Product settings**, under **Connect**, click\n**Tax form settings**.\n\n![Add the state tax registration or withholding ID for each state you'll\nfile](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/state_tax_registration_id.b61e81338146c94a3e98ee995cd866ce.png)\n\nRefer to the tables in the [Check 1099 form requirements by\nstate](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/tax-forms-state-requirements#check-1099-form-requirements-by-state)\nsection to determine where you might need state online accounts and IDs. If\nprompted that some state registration or withholding IDs were missing during\nfiling, you must add the missing IDs on the Connect [Tax forms\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/tax_forms) page, and\nthen go through the filing flow again. Delaware and Pennsylvania typically\nreject state filings if state IDs are missing and a state ID was issued.\n\n## State-by-state breakdown\n\nWhen you’re ready to [file forms in your\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/file-tax-forms), the forms for IRS\nand state reporting agencies will be filed at the same time. To understand the\nnumber of forms being filed in each state, click **Show state-by-state\nbreakdown** on the **File Federal and state tax forms** window in the filing\nflow. This page also indicates whether the state’s registration or withholding\nID is missing or has already been provided. A yellow informational banner\ndisplays at the top of every page in the filing flow if state IDs are missing\nfrom states that are being filed.\n\n![Review filing details page displaying a banner to indicate a missing Tax\nID.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/tax-forms-review-filing-missing-ID.40d5902778ca845d5190d1679d9f4ee8.png)\n\n## Withholding\n\nStripe can’t file tax forms with the state authorities if state withholding is\npresent. If you have forms with state withholding, Stripe won’t file those with\nthe states but will make the files available as an export and file with the IRS.\nPlease check the **Exports & Imports** section in the Dashboard for the\ndownloaded file. Please consult a tax advisor on how/whether to file these forms\nwith state agencies.\n\n## Check 1099 form requirements by state\n\nChoose the form type to view state filing requirements:\n\n- [1099-K](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/1099-K)\n- [1099-NEC](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/1099-NEC)\n- [1099-MISC](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/1099-MISC)\n\n## Correct 1099 reports with the states\n\nWhen you file a correction with the IRS, the state correction is filed at the\nsame time. To file a\n[correction](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/correct-tax-forms) with a state for\na form that was already filed, you must create a correction.\n\n## Frequently asked questions\n\nThe following section provides answers to common questions about filing tax\nforms through Connect.\n\n### What happens if a connected account needs their form filed in multiple states?\n\nStripe does not support this at the moment. Stripe only checks eligibility and\nfiles in the state where the connected account’s address is registered.\n\n### When we click “File”, does Stripe file with the IRS and the States at the same time, or do we have the ability to make changes if one has a later deadline?\n\nStripe files with the IRS and the State right away when you file the submission\nand you can’t make changes to that. But platforms are always able to make\n“corrections” and then file them and Stripe takes care of processing those\ncorrections to the IRS and the State.\n\n### How do I know if a particular form will be filed with the state?\n\nWe’ve introduced a new State filing status. For more information, see\n[Understand tax form\nstatus](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-tax-reporting#understand-tax-form-status).\n\n### Can I override the filing requirement for State filing without overriding the filing requirement for Federal filing?\n\nNo. If you override the filing requirements, it applies to both federal and\nstate filing.\n\n### Why wasn’t the state filing status overridden when I selected “File even if incomplete”?\n\nWhen you choose to override the filing status and select **File even if\nincomplete**, there are still certain edge cases where your form might still\nhave a state filing status of `Needs Attention`. This is done to minimize the\nrisk of rejections from the state. Take note of the following state-specific\nrules:\n\n- Pennsylvania: The form must have a non-zero Taxpayer Identification Number\n(TIN) and pass a basic address validation check, which requires at least one\ndigit and one number in the address.\n- Illinois: The form must have a non-zero TIN and a valid payee name.\n- Oregon: The form must have a non-zero TIN.\n- District of Columbia: The form cannot have a TIN with all digits being the\nsame number.\n\n## Links\n\n- [file](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/file-tax-forms)\n- [Tax reporting](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/taxes/forms)\n- [1099 form requirements by\nstate](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/tax-forms-state-requirements#check-1099-form-requirements-by-state)\n- [Configure your tax forms\nsettings](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-tax-reporting#set-tax-form-default-settings)\n- [export](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/modify-tax-forms?method=csv)\n- [Tax forms settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/tax_forms)\n- [1099-K](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/1099-K)\n- [1099-NEC](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/1099-NEC)\n- [1099-MISC](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/1099-MISC)\n- [correction](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/correct-tax-forms)\n- [Understand tax form\nstatus](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-tax-reporting#understand-tax-form-status)",
