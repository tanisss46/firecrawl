A fraudster might do this by purchasing stolen credit card\ninformation, and then attempting to validate or make purchases with those cards\nto determine which cards are still valid. Other common terms for card testing\nare “carding”, “account testing”, “enumeration”, and “card checking.”\n\nFraudulent activity such as card testing is an unavoidable part of online\ncommerce. Card testing, however, has consequences for the entire payments\necosystem, so merchants, card networks, and Stripe share responsibility to\nprevent it. At Stripe, we’re constantly improving our tools and systems to\ndetect and reduce fraud, but you must remain vigilant with respect to fraud.\n\n## How card testing works\n\nCard testers use both card setup and payments to determine whether the stolen or\nenumerated card information they have is valid or not. To quickly validate many\ncard numbers, fraudsters use scripts to test a large amount of card information\nat once, and collect 3DS or issuer responses to validate which card information\nis valid. After they have identified the valid cards, they can cash them with\nmerchants or resell confirmed cards on the dark web.\n\n- **Card Setup**—This is a method preferred by fraudsters, as card validation\nand authorizations during card setup don’t typically show up on cardholder\nstatements. This reduces the likelihood of card holders noticing and reporting\nthe fraudulent activity.\n- **Payments**—Card testers create small amount payments, which are cardholders\nare less likely to notice and reported as fraudulent.\n\n## Card testing consequences\n\nCard testing has many negative outcomes, some of which get worse over time as\ncard testing continues:\n\n- **Disputes**— Many types of card testing involve payments, some of which\nsucceed.
