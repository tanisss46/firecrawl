If you’re a Connect\nplatform, see [Connect\nsupport](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/pay-with-crypto#connect-support).\n\nWhen integrated, the option to pay with crypto appears in your checkout page,\nredirecting customers to a page hosted by *crypto.link.com* for payment\ncompletion. There, your customers can connect their wallet, and save and reuse\ntheir account using [Link](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link). You’re\n[immediately\nnotified](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#payment-notification)\nif the payment succeeds or fails. Before you get started, see our Pay with\nCrypto [demo](https://buy.stripe.com/test_28o4ig0SY9Xq8co3cc).\n\n![Let your users pay with\ncrypto](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/integrate-pay-with-crypto.9c892006170bb95a93c6a94411c3bff9.png)\n\nLet your users pay with crypto\n\nWebMobileStripe-hosted pageAdvanced integrationDirect APIStripe-hosted\npageAdvanced integrationDirect APIiOSAndroid\nBefore you can enable crypto as a payment method within the prebuilt checkout\npage, go to your [payment methods\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and request the\n**Crypto**. After we review your information and approve you as a user, the\n**Crypto** payment method appears as active in the Stripe Dashboard.\n\nWhen creating a new [Checkout\nSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions), you need to:\n\n- Add `crypto` to the list of `payment_method_types`.\n- Make sure all `line_items` use `usd`.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/checkout/sessions \\\n -u sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2: \\\n -d mode=payment \\\n -d \"payment_method_types[0]\"=crypto \\\n -d \"line_items[0][price_data][currency]\"=usd \\\n -d \"line_items[0][price_data][product_data][name]\"=T-shirt \\\n -d \"line_items[0][price_data][unit_amount]\"=2000 \\\n -d \"line_items[0][quantity]\"=1 \\\n --data-urlencode success_url=\"https://example.com/success\"\n```\n\n## Test your integration\n\nTest your Pay with Crypto integration with your test API keys by viewing the\nredirect page. You can test the successful payment case by authenticating the\npayment on the redirect page. The\n[PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object) transitions\nfrom `requires_action` to `succeeded`.\n\n- In test mode, you’re redirected to a payment page where you can pay with\ntestnet crypto assets.\n- Make sure that your wallet is configured to the test network you intend to pay\nover. For example, if you want to pay with USDC on Ethereum, make sure your\nwallet is set to Ethereum’s Sepolia test network.\n\n#### Fund your wallet with test assets\n\nYou can use testnet “faucets” to top up your wallet. Here are a few:\n\n- [Circle USDC](https://faucet.circle.com/)\n- [Paxos USDP](https://faucet.paxos.com/)\n- [Devnet SOL](https://faucet.solana.com/)\n- [Sepolia ETH](https://faucets.chain.link/sepolia)\n- [Amoy POL](https://faucet.polygon.technology/)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Pay with Crypto](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/pay-with-crypto)\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout)\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements)\n- [Payment Intents API](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents)\n- [Connect\nsupport](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/pay-with-crypto#connect-support)\n- [Link](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link)\n- [immediately\nnotified](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#payment-notification)\n- [demo](https://buy.stripe.com/test_28o4ig0SY9Xq8co3cc)\n- [payment methods\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods)\n- [Checkout Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions)\n- [https://example.com/success](https://example.com/success)\n- [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object)\n- [Circle USDC](https://faucet.circle.com/)\n- [Paxos USDP](https://faucet.paxos.com/)\n- [Devnet SOL](https://faucet.solana.com/)\n- [Sepolia ETH](https://faucets.chain.link/sepolia)\n- [Amoy POL](https://faucet.polygon.technology/)",
