# Subscriptions now default to not defining their trial periods depending on a planBreaking changes

## What’s new

When creating or updating subscriptions, the default value of `trial_from_plan`
is now `false`, meaning that a subscription no longer automatically inherits a
plan’s `trial_period_days`. If a subscription is already trialing, switching to
a new plan without specifying `trial_from_plan` maintains the trial. We
recommend setting an explicit trial per subscription instead of setting trials
on plans.

## Impact

This change alters the default behavior for subscription trials, no longer
automatically inheriting trial periods from plans. You must now explicitly set
`trial_from_plan` to `true` if they want to use a plan’s trial period, or set
trial periods directly on subscriptions.
