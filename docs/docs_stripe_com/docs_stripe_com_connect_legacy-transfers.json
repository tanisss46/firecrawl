  "content": "# Controlling bank and debit card transfers\n\n## Stripe allows platforms to entirely control the transfers for its Custom Connect accounts.\n\n#### Caution\n\nThis page describes an older version of\n[Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect). In the latest version of Connect,\nthe legacy `transfers` endpoint has been deprecated in favor of `payouts`. The\nDashboard’s user interface reflects this change, using the term\n“[payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts)” instead of transfers, regardless of\nyour Stripe API version. Refer to [bank and debit card\npayouts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/payouts-connected-accounts) for\ninformation about the latest version of the Connect API.\n\nBy default, any charge you make on behalf of a connected account accumulates in\nthe connected account’s [Stripe\nbalance](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-balances) and is paid out on a\ndaily rolling basis. However, Stripe offers fine-grained control over this\nbehavior for Custom accounts.\n\nYou can:\n\n- Set the destination [bank accounts and debit\ncards](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/legacy-transfers#bank-accounts)\n- Control [how\nfrequently](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/legacy-transfers#payout-information)\nfunds are automatically paid out\n- Perform [manual\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/legacy-transfers#using-manual-transfers)\n- Send funds\n[instantly](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/legacy-transfers#instant-payouts)\n\n## Managing bank accounts and debit cards\n\nCustom accounts have an `external_accounts` property: a list of all bank\naccounts and debit cards associated with the Stripe account. Any external\naccount is a possible destination for funds.\n\n```\n{\n \"id\": \"{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}\",\n \"object\": \"account\",\n \"external_accounts\": {\n \"object\": \"list\",\n \"has_more\": false,\n \"url\": \"/v1/accounts/acct_14qyt6Alijdnw0EA/external_accounts\",\n \"data\": [\n {\n \"id\": \"{{BANK_ACCOUNT_ID}}\",\n \"object\": \"bank_account\",\n \"account\": \"acct_14qyt6Alijdnw0EA\",\n \"account_holder_name\": \"Jane Austen\",\n \"account_holder_type\": \"individual\",\n \"bank_name\": \"STRIPE TEST BANK\",\n \"country\": \"US\",\n \"currency\": \"usd\",\n \"default_for_currency\": false,\n \"fingerprint\": \"sSZ2yLp0EZTH17cF\",\n \"last4\": \"6789\",\n \"metadata\": {\n },\n \"routing_number\": \"110000000\",\n \"status\": \"new\"\n },\n {...},\n {...},\n ],\n ...\n}\n```\n\nDestination accounts are added via the `external_accounts` parameter when\n[creating](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom-accounts#create) or\n[updating](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/updating-service-agreements) Stripe\naccounts. The value should be a bank account or debit card token returned from\n[Stripe.js](https://docs.stripe.com/js). Alternatively, you can provide a hash\nof the bank account details, but using Stripe.js is preferred as it prevents\nsensitive data from hitting your server.\n\nWhen using debit cards as a transfer destination, the following restrictions\napply:\n\n- Must be a non-prepaid US Visa, Mastercard, or Discover\n- Limited to 9,999 USD per transfer on [Instant\nPayouts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/legacy-transfers#instant-payouts)\n- Generally limited to 3,000 USD per transfer otherwise\n\n## Managing multiple bank and debit accounts\n\nBy default, providing a new value for `external_accounts` while updating a\nCustom account *replaces* the existing account with the new one. To *add*\nadditional bank accounts or debit cards to a connected account, use the [Bank\nAccount](https://docs.stripe.com/api#account_create_bank_account) and\n[Card](https://docs.stripe.com/api#account_create_card) creation API endpoints.\n\n```\ncurl\nhttps://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts/{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}/external_accounts \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d external_account={{BANK_ACCOUNT_TOKEN_ID}}\n```\n\nWhen working with multiple currencies, Stripe automatically sends transfers to\nan associated bank account or debit card for its currency, thereby avoiding\nexchange fees. When there are multiple accounts available for a given currency,\nStripe uses the one set as `default_for_currency`.\n\nStripe maintains a list of [available country/currency\ncombinations](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/payouts-connected-accounts) for\nyour reference and to help your users choose from the supported options.\n\n## Payout information\n\nWhen using automatic transfers, the `transfer_schedule` property on an account\nindicates how often the Stripe account’s balance is automatically paid out:\n\n```\n{\n ...\n \"transfer_schedule\": {\n \"delay_days\": 7,\n \"interval\": \"daily\"\n },\n ...\n}\n```\n\nThe `delay_days` property reflects how long it takes charges (or linked\ntransfers) to become available for payout. This field is useful for controlling\nautomatic payouts. For example, if you want your Custom accounts to receive\ntheir funds 2 weeks after the charge is made, set `interval` to `daily` and\n`delay_days` to **14**. The default is the lowest permitted value for the\naccount, determined by the connected account’s country. When setting or updating\nthis field, you may pass the string **minimum** to choose the lowest permitted\nvalue.\n\nThere are four possible settings for the `interval` property:\n\n- **manual** prevents automatic payouts. You will have to manually pay out the\naccount’s balance using the [Transfers\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_transfer) (acting as the connected\naccount). Also set an account to `manual` to use [Instant\nPayouts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/legacy-transfers#instant-payouts).\n- **daily** automatically pays out charges `delay_days` days after they’re\ncreated. The `delay_days` value cannot be less than your own transfer schedule\nor less than the default transfer schedule for the account.\n- **weekly** automatically pays out the balance once a week, specified by the\n`weekly_anchor` parameter (a lower-case weekday such as **monday**).\n- **monthly** automatically pays out the balance once a month, specified by the\n`monthly_anchor` parameter (a number from 1 to 31).\n\n## Using manual transfers\n\nIf you set `transfer_schedule[interval]` to `manual` using the [Accounts\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api#account_object-transfer_schedule), Stripe will\nhold funds in the account holder’s balance until told to pay them out (or until\na maximum of 90 days have passed). To trigger a payout of these funds, use the\n[Transfers API](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_transfer).\n\nThe Transfers API is only for moving funds from a connected Stripe account’s\nbalance into their external account. To move funds between Stripe accounts, see\ncreating [separate charges and\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers) or\n[creating destination charges through the\nplatform](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges).\n\n#### Note\n\n*Escrow* has a precise legal definition and Stripe does not support escrow\naccounts. However, we do provide escrow-like behavior through manual transfers.\nThis gives you control over transfer timing, with the ability to delay payouts\nto Custom accounts for up to 90 days.\n\nManual transfers can be used as an alternative to escrow when there may be a\nrisk of a delayed delivery, or if there’s the possibility of a refund being\nneeded.\n\n### Standard transfers\n\nAs a basic transfer example, to have 10 USD sent from a Custom account’s Stripe\nbalance to their external account:\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/transfers \\\n -u sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2: \\\n -H \"Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTED_STRIPE_ACCOUNT_ID}}\" \\\n -d \"amount\"=1000 \\\n -d \"currency\"=\"usd\" \\\n -d \"destination\"=\"default_for_currency\"\n```\n\nSetting `destination=default_for_currency` tells Stripe to transfer to the\naccount’s default bank account or debit card for the given currency.\n\nWith a standard transfer, you can payout up to the user’s available balance. To\nfind that amount, perform a [retrieve\nbalance](https://docs.stripe.com/api#retrieve_balance) call on their behalf.\n\nStripe tracks balance contributions from different payment sources in separate\nbalances. The retrieve balance response breaks down the components of each\nbalance by source type. For example, if you want to create a transfer\nspecifically for a non-credit-card balance, specify the `source_type` in your\nrequest.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/transfers \\\n -u sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2: \\\n -d \"amount\"=24784 \\\n -d \"currency\"=\"usd\" \\\n -d \"destination\"=\"default_for_currency\" \\\n -d \"source_type\"=\"bank_account\"\n```\n\nNote that it is possible for any source’s balance component to go negative\n(through refunds or chargebacks), and transfers can’t be created for greater\nthan the aggregate available balance.\n\n### Using Instant Payouts\n\nWith Instant Payouts, you can immediately send funds to a Custom account’s debit\ncard. Funds typically appear in the associated bank account within 30 minutes,\nmaking it possible to go from charge to payout in mere moments.\n\nTo use Instant Payouts, specify **instant** for the `method` property when\ncreating the transfer:\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/transfers \\\n -u sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2: \\\n -H \"Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTED_STRIPE_ACCOUNT_ID}}\" \\\n -d \"amount\"=1000 \\\n -d \"currency\"=\"usd\" \\\n -d \"method\"=\"instant\"\n```\n\nInstant Payouts differ from other manual transfers in a couple of ways:\n\n- You can transfer an account’s available balance plus its *pending* balance\n- Instant Payouts can be requested on weekends and holidays\n\nInitially, platforms can transfer up to 500 USD per day—in total, across all\nconnected accounts—through Instant Payouts. [Contact\nus](https://support.stripe.com/contact) if you need this threshold increased.\n\nInstant Payouts is available for all of the largest US banks, but a small\npercentage of banks do not yet support it. For those banks, you will have to\nfall back to standard payouts.\n\nWhen you add a card to an account, Stripe returns a property\n`available_payout_methods` in the response, which will be a set containing the\npayout methods Stripe supports for that card. Only values in this set should be\npassed as the `method` when creating a transfer.\n\n```\n{\n \"id\": \"{{CARD_ID}}\",\n \"object\": \"card\",\n ...\n \"account\": \"acct_1032D82eZvKYlo2C\",\n \"available_payout_methods\": [\"standard\", \"instant\"],\n}\n```\n\nIf a Custom account’s card does not support Instant Payouts, you should clearly\ncommunicate to the owner of that account that they will not receive their\npayouts instantly.\n\n### Using webhooks with transfers\n\nAll transfer activity on connected accounts can be tracked using\n[webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks). (When using Connect, you should\nalways be using webhooks.) Specific to transfers, you’ll see these events:\n\n- `transfer.created`\n- `transfer.updated`\n- `transfer.paid`\n- `transfer.failed`\n\nFor most transfers, these event notifications occur over a series of days.\nInstant Payouts typically send `transfer.paid` within 30 minutes.\n\nIf a transfer cannot be completed, a `transfer.failed` event occurs. The event’s\n`failure_reason` property indicates why.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Custom accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom-accounts)\n- [Updating\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/updating-service-agreements)\n- [Understanding Connect account\nbalances](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-balances)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)\n- [payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts)\n- [bank and debit card\npayouts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/payouts-connected-accounts)\n- [Standard accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/standard-accounts)\n- [Stripe balance](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-balances)\n- [creating](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom-accounts#create)\n- [updating](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/updating-service-agreements)\n- [Stripe.js](https://docs.stripe.com/js)\n- [Bank Account](https://docs.stripe.com/api#account_create_bank_account)\n- [Card](https://docs.stripe.com/api#account_create_card)\n- [Transfers API](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_transfer)\n- [Accounts API](https://docs.stripe.com/api#account_object-transfer_schedule)\n- [separate charges and\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n- [creating destination charges through the\nplatform](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges)\n- [retrieve balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api#retrieve_balance)\n- [Contact us](https://support.stripe.com/contact)\n- [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks)\n- [Custom accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom-accounts)",
