started more quickly, this guide presents no-code options where available.

## Product modeling

Set up pricing structures for different products. Stripe Billing supports many
types of pricing models, including:

- Flat rate-Good-better-best
- Per-seat
- Usage-based pricing
- Tiered pricing
- Multiple prices
- Multiple products in a subscription

Learn more about [product
modeling](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models).

## Display pricing information

The pricing table is an embeddable UI component that displays pricing models for
different subscription options. With pricing tables, customers can view pricing
information and select a subscription. After selecting a subscription, they can
complete the purchase with Stripe Checkout. Learn more about [pricing tables for
SaaS businesses](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/pricing-table).

Embed a pricing table on your website to display pricing details and convert
customers to checkout.

## Enable discounts

Use discounts to acquire new subscribers. You can create coupons and apply them
to a subscription or create a customer-facing promotion code that customers can
apply at checkout. Learn more about [discounts for
subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/coupons).

## Offer trials

Let customers try your product before subscribing. With Stripe Checkout, they
can sign up for a trial without submitting payment information. You can
configure a subscription to automatically send a reminder email when the trial
is about to expire. Learn more about
[trials](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/free-trials).

## Manage subscriptions

The customer portal lets customers manage their subscriptions in a self-serve
environment where they can:

- Update their subscription plan
- Cancel their subscription plan
- Add or update a payment method
- Update billing and shipping information
- Review their invoice history

Learn more about [integrating the customer
portal](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management).

## Set up invoices

Invoices represent how much money a customer owes, and Stripe automatically
generates one for every period in a subscription billing cycle. You can also
create an invoice manually for custom deals or one-time payments. When an
invoice is due, Stripe tries to collect payment by either automatically charging
the payment method on file, or emailing the invoice. Learn more about
[invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing).

[Monitor subscription activity](https://docs.stripe.com/saas#monitor)
Monitor subscriptions in the Dashboard or set up webhook endpoints and listen
for events. Learn more about [subscriptions and
webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/webhooks).

You can also use [Affiliate and referral Stripe
Apps](https://marketplace.stripe.com/categories/affiliate_and_referrals) to set
up and manage referral and affiliate programs with Stripe, get customer
information, and automate commission adjustments from the Stripe Dashboard.

## Reduce involuntary churn

Use recovery tools like Smart Retries and reminder emails to recover revenue
that would be lost to involuntary churn. Learn more about [revenue recovery
tools](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/revenue-recovery).

## Manage sales tax

After you register to collect taxes, Stripe Tax determines your customerâ€™s
location, and automatically calculates and collects the correct amount of tax at
checkout. Stripe Tax supports sales tax, VAT, and GST. Learn more about [Stripe
Tax](https://docs.stripe.com/tax).

## Automate revenue recognition

Use Stripe Revenue Recognition to automate revenue reporting and stay compliant
with rules for accrual accounting. Stripe Revenue Recognition automates revenue
accounting based on your payments and billing transactions.

Learn more about [Revenue
Recognition](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition).

## Test your integration

Test your integration to make sure it behaves as you expect. With test clocks,
you can simulate how a subscription integration would handle events such as
trials and payment failures over a billing cycle. Learn more about [testing
subscriptions integrations](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/testing).
