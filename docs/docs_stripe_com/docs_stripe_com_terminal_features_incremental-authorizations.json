  "content": "# Incremental authorizations\n\n## Increase the authorized amount before capturing a payment.\n\nIncremental authorizations allow you to increase the authorized\n[amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-amount)\non a confirmed [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents)\nbefore you capture it. This is helpful if the total price changes or the\ncustomer adds goods or services and you need to update the amount on the\npayment.\n\nDepending on the issuing bank, cardholders might see the amount of the original\npending authorization increase in place, or they might see each increment as an\nadditional pending authorization. After capture, the total captured amount\nappears as one entry.\n\n## Availability\n\nWhen using incremental authorizations, be aware of the following restrictions:\n\n- They’re only available with Visa, Mastercard, or Discover.\n- Certain card brands have merchant category restrictions (see below).\n- You can only increment a transaction made with the POS and reader fully\nonline.\n- You have a maximum of 10 attempts per payment.\n\n#### Availability by card network and merchant category\n\nUse incremental authorizations on payments that fulfill the criteria below. You\ncan find your user category in the\n[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/update/company/update).\n\nAttempting to perform an incremental authorization on a payment that doesn’t\nfulfill the below criteria results in an error.\n\nCard brandMerchant categoryVisaAll user categoriesMastercardAll user\ncategoriesDiscoverCar rental, hotels, local/suburban commuter, passenger\ntransportation, including ferries, passenger railways, bus lines-charter, tour,\nsteamship/cruise lines, boat rentals & lease, grocery stores and supermarkets,\nelectric vehicle charging, eating places and restaurants, drinking places\n(alcoholic beverages), hotels, motels, resorts, trailer parks & campgrounds,\nequip/tool/furn/appl rental & leasing, automobile rental agency, truck and\nutility trailer rentals, motor home and rec vehicle rentals, parking lots,\nparking meters, and garages, amusement parks, circuses, fortune tell, recreation\nservices (not classified)[Request incremental authorization\nsupportServer-sideClient-side](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/incremental-authorizations#request-incremental-authorization-support)\nWhen you create a `PaymentIntent`, you can request the ability to capture\nincrements of the payment. Set the\n[request_incremental_authorization_support](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-payment_method_options-card_present-request_incremental_authorization_support)\nfield to `true` and the\n[capture_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-capture_method)\nto `manual`.

This\nattempts to authorize for the difference between the previous amount and the\nincremented amount.
