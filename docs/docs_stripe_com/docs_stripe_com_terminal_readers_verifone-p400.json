If you’re getting started with\nStripe Terminal, we recommend [viewing our current reader\nofferings](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/setup-reader).\n\n!\n\nThe [Verifone\nP400](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/setup-reader/verifone-p400) is a\ncountertop reader for Stripe Terminal apps. It\n[connects](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/connect-reader?reader-type=internet)\nto the Stripe Terminal SDK over the internet.\n\nThis reader is compatible with JavaScript, iOS, Android, and React Native SDKs.\nTo view the reader’s parts and features, see the [product\nsheet](https://www.verifone.com/sites/default/files/2018-01/p400_datasheet_ltr_013018.pdf).\n\n## Troubleshoot the reader\n\nMake sure your network meets all of our [network\nrequirements](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/network-requirements), and try\nthe steps in the [network\ntroubleshooting](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/network-requirements#troubleshooting)\nsection.\n\nTo begin troubleshooting, use the following common scenarios to help diagnose\nwhat’s broken.\n\n### Reader is unable to connect\n\nStripe provides two debug screens on the reader. Use these screens to help\ndiagnose common connectivity and network issues. To access a debug screen, enter\nthe following key sequences while on the splash screen:\n\nKey SequenceDebug ScreenDescription0-4-2-6-8Device StatusShows the device’s IP\naddress, account ID, location, gateway, network mask, and connectivity\nstatus.0-8-6-2-4ConnectivityStarts a network test, by attempting to connect to\nthe required endpoints.\nTo exit a debug screen, press **0** on the keypad. You can also program your app\nto re-render the screen by calling any of these functions:\n\n- `connectReader()`\n- `collectPayment()`\n- `setReaderDisplay()`\n\n#### Note\n\nDebug screens overlay the reader’s normal screen display, and can trigger only\nwhile on the [reader\nscreens](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/readers/verifone-p400#reader-screens)\nshown above.\n\n### Reader is unable to update\n\nIf your reader isn’t updating, it’s possible that it can’t connect to Stripe.\nMake sure the network it’s connected to meets our [network\nrequirements](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/network-requirements).\n\n### Reader doesn’t have IP address\n\nThe **Device Status** [debug\nscreen](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/readers/verifone-p400#checking-connectivity)\nshows the reader’s IP address, or **No ETH** if the device doesn’t have an IP\naddress. Use the following steps to debug a **No ETH** condition.\n\n**Other IP-address**\n\nIf the above steps don’t reveal an IP address on the reader, try these\nadditional steps:\n\n- Unplug and reconnect the Ethernet connection to the network source (that is,\nthe modem for router networking, or your computer for bridged networking).\n- Restart the reader with the network source attached to it. You can restart the\nreader by unplugging and reconnecting the power cable from the connector cable.\n- Check the connectors for any broken hardware (such as bent pins).\n\n#### Note\n\nRemember to connect *production* deployments to the merchant network through\nrouter networking.\n\n### Reader has IP address, but is unable to communicate with Stripe\n\nThe **Connectivity** [debug\nscreen](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/readers/verifone-p400#checking-connectivity)\nindicates the connection status between the P400 and Stripe. Refer to our\n[network requirements](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/network-requirements)\nfor details and further troubleshooting steps.\n\n## Stripe reader software\n\nStripe maintains the software that controls the Verifone P400. The reader\nreceives updates automatically from Stripe when not in use. Read about [reader\nsoftware\nupdates](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/setup-reader#reader-software-updates)\nfor details. These can include improvements and required security updates from\nStripe and our hardware partners. As reader software updates are made available,\nupdate your readers to the latest available version to continue using Stripe\nTerminal. Failing to install a required update can prevent a reader from\naccepting payments.\n\nThe reader restarts every day at midnight for PCI compliance, and disconnects\nfrom the POS app every morning. Leave your reader connected to power to receive\nautomatic software updates. This ensures that updates happen at midnight (in the\ntimezone of the [assigned\nlocation](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/fleet/locations-and-zones)) to avoid\ninterruption to sales. If you unplug the reader at night, an update could start\nwhen you turn it back on. To manually check for an update, reboot the reader.\n\nYou can always check the current reader version by pressing **0-4-2-6-8**.\n\n### Verifone P400 software releases\n\nVersionDescription`3.0.2.5`Bug fixes and performance improvements.`3.0.2.3`Fixed\n`cardholder_name` for contactless transactions.`3.0.2.1`Updated server on-device\nto now host a unique PQDN per device.`3.0.1.18`Improved reader\nreliability.`3.0.1.16`Updated messaging to more strongly advocate for the use of\ncontactless payment methods.`3.0.1.15`Added automatic handling of soft\ndeclines.`3.0.1.14`Added support for `cardholder_name` in payment method\ndetails.`3.0.1.13`Added support for additional integration methods, fixed some\nlocalization issues.`3.0.1.12`Fixed some international refunds issues, improved\nWiFi disconnection handling and retries.`3.0.1.10`Added regional support for\nCanadian merchants.`3.0.1.8`Added improved triaging tools, bug fixes, and\nprerequisite work for future features.`3.0.1.6`Implemented WiFi upgrades\nimproving re-connection of cached networks, bug fixes.`3.0.1.5`Added support for\nregional EMV configurations, bug fixes.`3.0.1.2`Changed red `X` button behavior\nin testmode (now clears a transaction’s payment method instead of canceling that\ntransaction; this mirrors livemode behavior), added MAC address to Device Status\ndebug screen, bug fixes.`3.0.1.0`Added new reader screens for better UX,\ndisabled contactless sources during `readReusableCard`, fixed bugs.\nFor additional instruction on maintaining [PCI\ncompliance](https://docs.stripe.com/security/guide#validating-pci-compliance)\nwhen installing updates to your Verifone P400 device, refer to the reader PCI\n[implementation\nguide](https://d37ugbyn3rpeym.cloudfront.net/docs/files/terminal/terminal_implementation_guide.pdf).\n\n## See also\n\n- [Set up Verifone\nP400](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/setup-reader/verifone-p400)\n- [Set up your\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/setup-integration)\n- [Connect to a\nreader](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/connect-reader)\n- [Collect\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/collect-card-payment)\n\nThe BBPOS and Chipper™ name and logo are trademarks or registered trademarks of\nBBPOS Limited in the United States and/or other countries.
