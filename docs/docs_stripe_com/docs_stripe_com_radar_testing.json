You can\ninspect that list of payments to verify the criterion’s intended behavior, and\nwe also summarize those search results to help you estimate its future impact.\n\nFor each rule you test, the summary includes the volume and number of payments\nthat fall into the following categories:\n\n- **Disputes and early fraud warnings**: Payments that received a dispute or an\n[early fraud warning\n(EFW)](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/how-disputes-work#early-fraud-warnings).\n- **Refunded payments**: Payments that were refunded.\n- **Blocked and failed payments**: Payments that were either blocked by Radar,\nblocked by Stripe, or declined by issuers.\n- **Succeeded payments**: Payments that are successfully processed and haven’t\nyet been identified as fraudulent nor refunded.\n\nAdditionally, when you test allow rules, you can also see **Overrides**. This\nrefers to payments that Radar blocks due to high risk of fraud or a custom block\nrule, but now will be allowed by your proposed rule. In the Dashboard, you can\nsee further breakdowns of these summary metrics. For example, you can see\nrefunds that are classified as fraudulent.\n\n![Screenshot that shows the potential impact a custom rule could\nhave](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/backtesting-review-new-rule.6f8037bd10a5877e60a6237ebdbd414d.png)\n\nReview the sample questions in the following table to help you decide if you can\nimplement your rule.\n\n#### Caution\n\nIt’s uncommon to find a perfect rule that only blocks fraudulent payments or\nonly allows good payments. Thus, your decision to implement a rule is typically\nbased on a trade-off. Consider if this rule will block enough fraudulent\npayments to be worthwhile compared to any valid payments it might incorrectly\nblock. The trade-off that’s right for you depends on the particulars of your\nbusiness. For more information, see our [fraud detection\nprimer](https://stripe.com/radar/guide#fraud-prevention-performance).\n\nRule type Implement this rule if…Block- It matches payments that were disputed,\nreceived an EFW, or refunded as fraud at the cost of an acceptable amount of\nlegitimate payments for your business.\n- It matches refunds and you’re trying to save operational burden and prevent\nrefund abuse.\n- It matches payments that failed because issuers declined the payment.\nSometimes, issuers might decrease auth rates for you if you send a [high number\nof transactions that\nfail](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/card-testing#consequences)\n(For example, if a business experiences a large amount of Card Testing).\nReview- It matches payments that were disputed, received an EFW, or refunded as\nfraud. It prompts your team to closely evaluate potential fraudulent\ntransactions or other suspicious payment activities.\nRequest 3DS- It matches payments that were disputed, received an EFW, or\nrefunded as fraud at the cost of an acceptable amount of legitimate payments for\nyour business. Note: 3DS does not always guarantee that your user will receive a\nchallenge. This means while you might get liability shift if a fraudster passes\nfrictionless 3DS and commits fraud, you might still receive an EFW (which\nultimately can lead to identification in VFMP).\nAllow- It matches an acceptable amount of previously blocked payments that you\nhave a high degree of certainty should be safe for your business. Allow rules\nare somewhat trickier to evaluate because there’s no way of knowing which\npreviously-blocked charges would, if allowed, have turned out to be fraudulent.\nSo, with these rules, it’s particularly important to review the list of matching\nhistorical payments to ensure these are payments you’d like to allow.\n- It doesn’t match a lot of Overrides. This indicates that you are letting\nthrough high risk payments.\n\n## Links\n\n- [test mode](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes)\n- [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payments)\n- [create a charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_charge)\n- [test API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys)\n- [add or update a rule](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules)\n- [early fraud warning\n(EFW)](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/how-disputes-work#early-fraud-warnings)\n- [fraud detection\nprimer](https://stripe.com/radar/guide#fraud-prevention-performance)\n- [high number of transactions that\nfail](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/card-testing#consequences)",
