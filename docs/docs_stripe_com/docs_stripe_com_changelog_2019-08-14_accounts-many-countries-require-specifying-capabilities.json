  "content": "# Configuring a person as an account opener no longer automatically sets them as an executiveBreaking changes\n\n## What’s new\n\nThe `relationship[executive]` field on a `Person` object is no longer\nautomatically set to `true` when you create a `Person` object with\n`relationship[account_opener]`. The `requirements` hash on an `Account` object\nmight require that you explicitly indicate that the `account_opener` is also an\n`executive`. If this is the case, you need to indicate it by setting\n`relationship[executive]=true`.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis change removes the automatic setting of `relationship[executive]` to `true`\nwhen creating a `Person` object with `relationship[account_opener]`. You now\nneed to explicitly set `relationship[executive]=true` if required by the\naccount’s `requirements` hash. This modification provides more precise control\nover person relationships in account management.\n\n## Upgrade\n\n- [View your current API\nversion](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#view-your-api-version-and-the-latest-available-upgrade-in-workbench)\nin Workbench.\n- If you use an SDK, upgrade to the corresponding SDK version for this API\nversion.- If you don’t use an SDK, update your [API\nrequests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/versioning) to include `Stripe-Version:\n2019-08-14`\n- Upgrade the API version used for [webhook\nendpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks/versioning).\n- [Test your integration](https://docs.stripe.com/testing) against the new\nversion.\n- If you use Connect, [test your Connect\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/testing).\n- In Workbench, [perform the\nupgrade](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#perform-the-upgrade).
