Customers then bring the\ninformation to a convenience store to make a cash payment. You will receive\npayment confirmation instantly, and funds will be available for\n[payout](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts) after 4 business days.\n\nCustomers can pay at FamilyMart, Lawson, Ministop, and Seicomart stores across\nJapan.\n\nPayment method propertiesBusiness locationsProduct support- **Customer\nlocations**\n\nJapan\n- **Payment method family**\n\nCash-based payment method\n- **Connect support**\n\nPartial: [request an\ninvite](https://support.stripe.com/contact/email?topic=payment_apis) to create\ncharges [on behalf of](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges#on_behalf_of)\nother accounts.\n- **Billing support**\n\n[Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/konbini#billing)\n- **Presentment currency**\n\nJPY\n- **Dispute support**\n\n[No](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/konbini#disputed-payments)\n- **Manual capture support**\n\nNo\n- **Payment confirmation**\n\nCustomer-initiated\n- **Payout timing**\n\nStandard payout timing applies\n- **Refunds / Partial refunds**\n\n[Yes / Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/konbini#refunds)\n- **Minimum charge amount**\n\n120 JPY\n- **Maximum charge amount**\n\n300,000 JPY\n\n## Payment flow\n\n!\n\n1.

If\nyou use our front-end products, Stripe automatically determines the most\nrelevant payment methods to display. Go to the [Stripe\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and enable\nKonbini. To get started with one of our hosted UIs, follow a quickstart:\n\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart): Our prebuilt, hosted\ncheckout page.\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart): Our drop-in UI\ncomponents.\n\n### Other payment products\n\nThe following Stripe products also let you add Konbini from the Dashboard:\n\n- [Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/no-code-guide)\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n- [Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview)\n\nIf you prefer to manually list payment methods, learn how to [manually configure\nKonbini as a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/konbini/accept-a-payment).\n\n## Disputes\n\nKonbini payments have a low risk of fraud or unrecognized payments because the\ncustomer must provide cash payment in person at a convenience store. Generally\nKonbini payments can’t be disputed by the customer. However, in some instances\nirregularities similar to disputes (by the convenience store) might occur, (for\nexample, due to mishandling). In these cases, Stripe will need to reach out to\nyou for next steps.\n\n## Refunds\n\nKonbini payments can be refunded either through the\n[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments) or\n[API](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_refund). To complete a refund, your\ncustomer must provide account information where funds should be returned to.\nStripe automatically contacts the customer at the email address provided at time\nof PaymentIntent confirmation and requests this information from them, after\nwhich the refund is processed automatically.\n\n## Billing\n\nUse [Stripe Billing](https://stripe.com/billing) to create Konbini supported\n[subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating) and\n[invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices).\n\nDue to the in-person nature of Konbini payments, [automatically\ncharged](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/automatic-charging) invoices are not\nsupported.\n\nInvoices and subscriptions need to be configured with a\n[collection_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-collection_method)\nof `send_invoice`.\n\n## Prohibited business categories\n\nOn top of the categories of [businesses restricted from using Stripe\noverall](https://stripe.com/restricted-businesses), the following categories are\nspecifically prohibited from using Konbini.\n\n- Sole proprietors who have been doing business for less than 3 years\n- Real Money Trading (RMT), that is, sale of virtual (in-game) characters,\ncurrency, and so on.\n- Gambling\n- Information selling, in particular:- Money making schemes\n- Investment related information\n- Gambling strategies for horse racing, pachinko, slot machines, and so on\n- Multi-level marketing and pyramid schemes\n- Gore content or products\n- Unscientific and superstition-based content or products\n- Prohibited medical products (per the Japanese Pharmaceutical Affairs Act)\n- Content or products offensive to public order or moral\n- Personal import facilitation (forwarding)\n- Foreign money transfer\n- Loans\n- Dating sites\n- E-cigarettes (vaping), waterpipes (shisha, hookah), and so on\n- Fortune-telling\n\nOur financial partner and convenience store chains might reject businesses at\ntheir discretion regardless of category.\n\n## Links\n\n- [payout](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts)\n- [request an\ninvite](https://support.stripe.com/contact/email?topic=payment_apis)\n- [on behalf of](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges#on_behalf_of)\n- [Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/konbini#billing)\n- [No](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/konbini#disputed-payments)\n- [Yes / Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/konbini#refunds)\n- [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods)\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart)\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart)\n- [Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/no-code-guide)\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n- [Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview)\n- [manually configure Konbini as a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/konbini/accept-a-payment)\n- [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments)\n- [API](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_refund)\n- [Stripe Billing](https://stripe.com/billing)\n- [subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating)\n- [invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n- [automatically charged](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/automatic-charging)\n-\n[collection_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-collection_method)\n- [businesses restricted from using Stripe\noverall](https://stripe.com/restricted-businesses)",
