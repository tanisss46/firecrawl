# Stripe Dashboard for connected accounts

## Learn about the features of the Stripe Dashboard for connected accounts.

The Stripe Dashboard is available to your platform’s connected accounts.

## Stripe Dashboard features

Connected accounts can use the Dashboard to:

- See analytics and charts about business performance
- View payments, balances, customers, billing, and other products
- Manage their business information and account settings
- Handle disputes, refunds, and chargebacks
- Download reports

## Accessing the Stripe Dashboard

Your connected accounts have access to the Stripe Dashboard after they’ve
completed onboarding. Consider linking to the
[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/) from your application.

## Platform controls

If you have [platform
controls](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/platform-controls-for-stripe-dashboard-accounts)
for a connected account, you can co-brand the Stripe Dashboard. Your platform
name is displayed in the bottom left corner of the user interface.
