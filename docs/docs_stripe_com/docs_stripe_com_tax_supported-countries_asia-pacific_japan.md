# Collect tax in Japan

## Learn how to use Stripe Tax to calculate, collect, and report tax in Japan.

In Japan, Stripe Tax supports calculation and collection of [Consumption Tax
(CT)](https://www.nta.go.jp/english/taxes/consumption_tax/index.htm).

## When to register for tax collection

See [Thresholds](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/thresholds) to get insights
about your potential tax registration obligations in Japan. Stripe also notifies
you with email and Dashboard alerts when you need to register to collect tax.

works](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/monitoring).

Remote sellers must register in Japan in either of the following cases:

- Their taxable sales in Japan exceed the registration threshold of 10 million
JPY in the base period.
- Their taxable sales exceed 10 million JPY in the specified period.

The base period refers to:

- The calendar year two years prior to the current one (for example, the base
period for the year of 2021 is 2019). This applies to sole proprietors.
- The business year two years prior to the current one. This applies to
corporations.

The specified period refers to the first 6 months of the previous calendar year
(for sole proprietors) or the first 6 months of a fiscal year (for
corporations).

Registered remote sellers must have an office located in Japan or have a tax
representative in Japan. Remote sellers that provide electronic services to
Japanese consumers can use a simplified registration procedure.

- **Threshold**: 10 million JPY
- **Time frame**: Japanese base period and specified period as defined above.
- **Included transactions**: Any taxable transactions that reverse charge
doesn’t apply to.

## Register to collect tax

To collect Consumption Tax, any business must either have an office located in

of electronic services, however there is a simplified registration process for
these businesses.

## How we calculate taxes

Stripe calculates CT for your transactions in Japan. Stripe assumes most sales
to be taxable unless specifically exempt. If you’re a remote seller and sell
services to Japanese customers, CT is typically collected on sales to
individuals. No tax is charged on sales to business customers who provide their
tax registration number.

## Report and file your taxes

Stripe provides reports of your completed tax transactions. Go to
[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations) to access these
reports. Learn more about [the different types of
reports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports).

You’re responsible for filing and remitting your taxes to Japan. Stripe doesn’t
file taxes on your behalf. However, we do have trusted partners who can help
manage your filing and remittance.
