# Regulatory compliance guidelinesPrivate preview

## Learn about the requirements and guidelines for regulatory compliance.

To offer and promote Stripe Capital to your users, your platform’s marketing and
user interfaces must adhere to the following regulatory compliance guidelines.
These guidelines can help your platform and users (connected accounts) navigate
the financial regulations applicable to Capital.

#### Caution

These guidelines aren’t legal advice. Platforms using Capital must seek their
own legal advice in respect to product branding and use of the product to offer
financial services.

## Compliance checklist

Ensure you’ve completed the following checklist prior to launching your program:

- Read the requirements for managing complaints
- Read the CAN-SPAM Act
- Read the UDAP guidelines
- Create a mandatory recordkeeping process

## Managing complaints

To create a responsive and equitable complaints handling process, you must
detail and distribute clear pathways to where your customers can report
complaints. Complaints are an important and mandatory part of the compliance
system for financial services products. We regard complaints as *any expressions
of dissatisfaction about our organization, products and services, policies,
employees, and contracted partners*.

If your customer contacts your support team with a complaint regarding the
Stripe Capital product, direct them to Stripe Servicing
([capital-support@stripe.com](mailto:capital-support@stripe.com)). Stripe
Servicing will handle any complaints received by your customers, and you must
forward any Stripe Capital complaints your platform directly receives back to
Stripe ([capital-support@stripe.com](mailto:capital-support@stripe.com)).

### Complaints reporting template

In summary:

- A complaint is *any expression of dissatisfaction about our organization,
products and services, policies, employees, and contracted partners*.
- An executive complaint is *(i) any Complaint from a regulatory authority (such
as a federal agency, a state agency, or a court with jurisdiction over Stripe or
the relevant Bank Partner) and (ii) any other person (including individuals and
legal entities) threatening material litigation.*
- You must provide a clear pathway for your customers to file a complaint
- You must report all Stripe Capital complaints your platform receives directly
to Stripe

## CAN-SPAM Act

The CAN-SPAM Act regulates marketing activity conducted by email.

- An email is deemed a commercial message, subject to the CAN-SPAM act, if the
primary purpose of the email is to convey a commercial advertisement, or to
promote a product or service.
- A transactional email is an email sent to a customer that has a primary
purpose relating to a particular transaction or relationship between you and the
customer (e.g. loan terms and conditions). The CAN-SPAM Act imposes more
rigorous requirements on commercial email messages, as compared with
transactional messages. Transactional messages are not subject to most of the
requirements of the CAN-SPAM Act. If a message contains both transactional
content and commercial content, the CAN-SPAM Act’s commercial email requirements
may apply, if the message’s primary purpose may be considered to be commercial.

To facilitate compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act, any employee or staff utilizing
or having access to your email systems and resources for marketing must adhere
to the following requirements:

- **Misleading Header Information**: Any email message, whether commercial or
transactional, must not contain: (i) false or misleading header information;
(ii) a “from” line that does not accurately identify any person (individual or
business) who initiated the message; and (iii) inaccurate or misleading
identification of a protected computer used to initiate the message for purposes
of disguising its origin.
- **Deceptive Subject Headings**: Any commercial email message must not contain
deceptive subject headings. For example, a deceptive subject heading is one that
would be likely to mislead the recipient about a material fact regarding the
message’s contents or subject matter.
- **Opt-out Mechanism**: You must provide your customers with the ability to
opt-out of receiving future commercial messages, and you must honor customer
requests to opt-out within ten days. You cannot require a user to pay a fee or
provide information other than an email address to opt-out.
- **Advertisement Identification**: Any commercial email message must contain
clear and conspicuous identification that the message is an advertisement or
solicitation.
- **Physical Address Disclosure**: Any commercial email message must disclose a
valid physical address of the sender.

#### Caution

Failure to comply with CAN-SPAM could result in hefty fines for every single
violation.

In summary:

- Subject lines must not contradict email body copy
- The sender or “from” email address can’t be confusing or misleading
- Email disclosures MUST include a physical business address
- Email disclosures must clearly identify the message as an advertisement
- There MUST be a clear and conspicuous opt-out link
- Email opt-outs must be honored within 10 days

## Testimonials

If you use a testimonial or endorsement to advertise Stripe products to your
customers, you must consider the following:

- The person giving a testimonial must be a real person and a real user of the
service or product they’re talking about.
- You must have their written permission to use their quote, and save this
written documentation in a place that can be easily accessed during audits. You
must also update this permission every 24 months.
- Product benefits, costs, or features in any quotes must be verifiable and true
to what most users can expect to experience when using the product or service.
- If you have paid someone for their quote, or given them anything of value, you
must put a disclaimer near the quote that says the following:- “This includes
even paid actors, if their scripting makes it sound like they’re giving a
personal testimonial.”

## UDAP and correct messaging

Federal regulation prohibits unfair and deceptive acts or practices (UDAP). To
avoid UDAP violations, you must think of the end user first when developing and
deploying any marketing materials.

Make sure that marketing materials use clear messaging that fully explains
product features, costs, benefits, and limitations. Don’t leave out key terms or
fees, and don’t advertise product uses or features that aren’t true.

DoDon’tOnly use statements about products that are true, accurate, and aligned
with how users engage with the products.Don’t leave out key information from
marketing content. If the information is likely to affect whether someone uses
the product, then it’s “key."If you make claims that require additional data to
support them, or if an end user needs to know more details to know how a certain
claim is true, you must:- Provide documented evidence.
- Disclose that information.
Make exaggerated claims that are hard to prove. Don’t make absolute statements
that are disproved by a single exception. For example, “number 1," “every,"
“only," “all," “never," “always."Clearly explain all qualifying limitations and
requirements needed by end users to get the product or features that you’ve
advertised.Don’t advertise features or programs that only a few applicants
actually qualify for.All disclosures must meet a “clear and conspicuous”
standard:- Font size must be large enough to read.
- Font color must visibly contrast with the background.
- Dynamic or video ads must have the disclosure on screen long enough to read.
Don’t make disclosures hard to read.Disclosures used to explain or modify a
claim must be ‘tied’ to the claim they’re explaining.- Use a hyperlink directly
linking to the disclosure, or include the disclosure next to the claim in the
copy itself.
- Use reference text or symbols (for example, an asterisk) directly after the
claim and before the disclosure language.
Don’t bury disclosures in other non-key disclosures or footnotes.Disclose all
account fees, costs, benefits, and terms as part of onboarding before your end
users take out a product.Don’t advertise products as “free” if you’re charging
fees.Make sure all images used are properly licensed and that you can document
this fact.Don’t use images, formatting, or copy that implies products are
endorsed by, or affiliated with, government entities or celebrities.
