In\naddition, make sure all your relevant cards have PINs set up by following our\n[PIN management guide](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/cards/pin-management).\n\n## Treatment of ATM transactions\n\nStripe Issuing treats ATM withdrawals as standard transactions, but a few\ncharacteristics of the authorization signal that it’s an ATM withdrawal:\n\n- The [merchant category\ncode](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/object#issuing_authorization_object-merchant_data-category_code)\nis set to 6011—`Automated Cash Disburse`.\n- An ATM [fee\nvalue](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/object#issuing_authorization_object-amount_details-atm_fee)\nmight be present.\n- The [PIN\ncheck](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/object#issuing_authorization_object-verification_data-pin_check)\nis a `match`.\n\nYou can approve or decline them using the same [webhook\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/controls/real-time-authorizations)\nas other authorizations.\n\n## Restrictions\n\n- **Limits**: ATM withdrawals are subject to a daily maximum limit. Your support\nrepresentative can share your limit with you and work to increase it if it’s not\nsufficient for your use case.\n- **Cash Deposits**: Stripe-issued cards aren’t enrolled in any ATM cash deposit\nprograms and don’t have the ability to accept cash deposits. Cash\ndeposit-enabled ATMs won’t trigger prompts for deposits when a Stripe-issued\ncard is used.\n\n## Availability\n\nUsers in the US can [contact support](https://support.stripe.com/?contact=true)\nto request ATM cash withdrawals on issued cards. Withdrawals are not yet\navailable in the UK or EU, but users can [contact\nsupport](https://support.stripe.com/?contact=true) for more information about\nfuture availability in these regions.\n\n## Fees\n\nStripe does not assess any fees of its own for ATM withdrawals, but ATM\noperators often do. These fees are generally:\n\n- **ATM use surcharge**: Added to the total transaction amount (this is the [atm\nfee](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/object#issuing_authorization_object-amount_details-atm_fee)\namount a cardholder sees at the ATM.)\n- **Dynamic Currency Conversion (DCC)**: When the cardholder is given the option\nbetween a local currency and the card’s default currency (for example, using a\nUS issued card in the EU), ATMs generally apply a markup on conversion rates\nwhen a cardholder picks the card’s default currency. While this isn’t an\nexplicit fee, the conversion rates functionally behave as a tax on ATM\ntransactions.\n\nNeither the ATM provider nor Stripe apply any cash advance fees or annual\npercentage rate (APR) to an ATM withdrawal.\n\nDifferent markets have different ATM rules and fee structures that influence the\nfrequency and intensity of the fees charged, but the way we describe the fees\nabove generally applies regardless of the country. If an ATM charges a fee to a\ncardholder, we’ll pass it on as part of the amount for a given authorization.\nOtherwise, cardholders and issuing users won’t see any impact.\n\n## Links\n\n- [through support](https://support.stripe.com/?contact=true)\n- [PIN management guide](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/cards/pin-management)\n- [merchant category\ncode](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/object#issuing_authorization_object-merchant_data-category_code)\n- [fee\nvalue](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/object#issuing_authorization_object-amount_details-atm_fee)\n- [PIN\ncheck](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/object#issuing_authorization_object-verification_data-pin_check)\n- [webhook\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/controls/real-time-authorizations)",
