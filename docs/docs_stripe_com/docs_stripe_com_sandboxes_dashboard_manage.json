Join [Stripe\nInsiders](https://insiders.stripe.dev/c/sandboxes/6), our new early access\nprogram, to register your interest in joining the Sandboxes preview.\n\nYou can use sandboxes for many common development needs. For example, you can:\n\n- Create a sandbox development environment for each member of your team.\n- Create a sandbox for a team within your organization.\n- Create a sandbox specifically for testing a new Stripe feature or a Stripe API\nupgrade.\n- Create a sandbox that mirrors live mode, so you can test and stage changes to\nyour integration before you go live.\n\nUse the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/) or the Stripe CLI to\nmanage your sandbox.\n\n## Create a sandbox\n\nIf you have the [Sandbox Administrator, Administrator, Developer, or Sandbox\nUser role](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/teams/roles), you can\ncreate a new sandbox. Your account can have up to five sandboxes.\n\nTo create a sandbox:\n\n- Click the account picker > **Sandboxes** > **Create sandbox** in the\nDashboard.\n- Enter a unique name that reflects the purpose of the sandbox (for example,\n“Staging”) in the **Name** field.\n- Decide if you want to adjust the toggle that [copies selected\nsettings](https://docs.stripe.com/sandboxes/dashboard/sandbox-settings) you\nalready have configured in your live account. Stripe copies these settings by\ndefault.\n- Click **Create**.\n\nStripe automatically assigns the Super Administrator role to any user that\ncreates a sandbox. This role allows them to carry out all operations within that\nparticular sandbox.\n\n## View a sandbox\n\nIf you have the Sandbox Administrator role, you can view all sandboxes. If you\nhave a Developer role, you can only view the sandboxes you’ve created. The roles\nassociated with a sandbox won’t change your access to test mode, allowing all\nteam members to continue accessing test mode.\n\n- Click the account picker > **Sandboxes** in the Dashboard.\n- Click **Open** to enter the sandbox.\n\nThe banner at the top of the Dashboard indicates that you’re in a sandbox. You\ncan navigate to any other part of the Dashboard.\n\n### View your current sandbox in the CLI\n\nTo display the sandbox you’re currently using, run the following command:\n\n```\nstripe preview whoami\n```\n\n```\n Default Sandbox {{SANDBOX_ID}}\n\n```\n\n## Update a sandbox\n\nAny member of your team with the Sandbox Administrator role can update the name\nand details of any sandbox. Developers can only update the name and details of a\nsandbox that they’ve created.\n\n- Click the account picker > **Sandboxes** in the Dashboard, then select a\nsandbox.\n- Click **Settings** in the top right corner.\n- Update the name or additional details about your sandbox’s account (for\nexample, the branding).\n\n## Delete a sandbox\n\nIf you have the Administrator or Sandbox Administrator role, you can delete a\nsandbox. Otherwise, only the sandbox’s owner can delete it.\n\n- Click the account picker > **Sandboxes** in the Dashboard.\n- Click the trash can icon associated with the sandbox.\n- Confirm that you want to delete this sandbox as this action can’t be undone.\nAfter deletion, we remove all data associated with the sandbox and revoke\naccess.\n\n#### Note\n\nDeleting a sandbox deletes all the data associated with the sandbox and removes\naccess for any other team members who had access to the sandbox.\n\n## Switch to a sandbox in the CLI\n\nYou can switch the sandbox you’re operating on in your CLI. To switch to a\ndifferent sandbox, run the following command:\n\n```\nstripe preview use\n```\n\n```\nYou are currently operating on Default Sandbox ({{SANDBOX_ID}})\n\n* indicates your active workspace. Use the arrow keys to navigate: ↓ ↑ → ←\n? Select the sandbox you'd like to use:\n ▸ * Default Sandbox {{SANDBOX_ID}}\n QA Team Sandbox {{SANDBOX_ID}}\n Developer Sandbox {{SANDBOX_ID}}\n\n```\n\nNext, select the sandbox you want to switch to.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Stripe Insiders](https://insiders.stripe.dev/c/sandboxes/6)\n- [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/)\n- [Sandbox Administrator, Administrator, Developer, or Sandbox User\nrole](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/teams/roles)\n- [copies selected\nsettings](https://docs.stripe.com/sandboxes/dashboard/sandbox-settings)",
