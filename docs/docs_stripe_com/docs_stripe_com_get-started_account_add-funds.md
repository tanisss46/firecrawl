# Add funds to your Stripe balance

## Cover increased refunds and chargebacks by adding funds to your balance.

To keep your business healthy when your account has a negative balance or when
you expect an increase in customer refunds, you can add funds directly to your
Stripe balance using a wire or bank transfer.

You can proactively add funds to use for future refunds or chargebacks. These
funds are held separately from your earnings,
[payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts), and funds from other Stripe
products.

## Add funds

To add funds to your balance using the Dashboard:

- Determine how much you want to add to your balance.
- Go to the [Balances](https://dashboard.stripe.com/balance/overview) page in
the Dashboard, and click **Add to balance**.
- Select whether you want to use a wire or local bank transfer, review Stripe’s
bank information, and click **Done**.
- Initiate the transfer from your bank account.
- After your bank has sent the funds, return to
[Balances](https://dashboard.stripe.com/balance/overview), and click **Add to
balance**.
- *(Optional)* If the dialog prompts you for a receipt, upload a screenshot or
the file that proves that your bank transferred the funds.

- To fund your Stripe balance faster, we might ask you to include a screenshot
or PDF of your bank’s transfer or wire confirmation.
- Click **Confirm Transfer**.

## View and use your funds

To see the total amount of funds set aside for future refunds, disputes, or
negative balances, go to **Future refunds or disputes or negative balance** in
the [Balances](https://dashboard.stripe.com/balance/overview) page. Stripe uses
these funds first when it processes a refund or a customer disputes a payment.
If no funds remain, we process refunds and disputes from your available balance.
If you receive an email from Stripe about debiting your bank account, first
check your balance.

#### Payouts

If you don’t need to have extra funds set aside, you can pay them out to your
bank.

## Settlement timing

Funds typically show up in your balance within 1 to 7 business days, depending
on the method used to add funds. For ACH transfers, it usually takes 1 to 5
business days.

To have funds settle to your account without delay, make sure the wire or
transfer from your bank includes your Stripe unique reference code in the
transfer memo. Find this unique reference code on the
[Balances](https://dashboard.stripe.com/balance/overview) page in the Dashboard.
