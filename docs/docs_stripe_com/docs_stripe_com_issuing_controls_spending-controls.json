  "content": "# Issuing spending controls\n\n## Learn how to use Issuing to set rules on cards and cardholders to control spending.\n\nYou can use spending controls to block [merchant\ncategories](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/categories) (for example, bakeries),\n[countries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/object#issuing_authorization_object-merchant_data-country),\nor [merchant\nIDs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/object#issuing_authorization_object-merchant_data-network_id),\nand to set spending limits such as 100 USD per authorization or 3000 USD per\nmonth. You can apply them to both\n[Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/object#issuing_card_object-spending_controls)\nand\n[Cardholders](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cardholders/object#issuing_cardholder_object-spending_controls)\neither by setting their `spending_controls` fields when you create them or by\nupdating them later.\n\nThe `spending_controls` object has the following structure:\n\nField TypeDescription`allowed_categories` arrayList of\n[categories](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/categories) of authorizations to\nallow. All other categories will be blocked.`blocked_categories` arrayList of\n[categories](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/categories) of authorizations to\ndecline. All other categories will be allowed.`spending_limits` arrayList of\n[objects](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/controls/spending-controls#spending-limits)\nthat specify amount-based rules.`allowed_merchant_countries` arrayList of\nmerchant\n[countries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/object#issuing_authorization_object-merchant_data-country)\nto allow authorizations from. Authorizations from all other countries are\nblocked.`blocked_merchant_countries` arrayList of merchant\n[countries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/object#issuing_authorization_object-merchant_data-country)\nto block authorizations from. Authorizations from all other countries are\nallowed.\nSpending controls run before [real-time\nauthorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/controls/real-time-authorizations)\nand can decline a purchase before the `issuing_authorization.request` is sent,\nresulting in a declined `issuing_authorization.created` event.\n\n#### Note\n\nMerchant ID spend controls are currently limited to beta users. You must be an\nIssuing customer to join the beta. To request access to the beta, Contact Stripe\nfor more information.\n\n## Spending limits\n\nSpending limit rules limit the total amount of spending for categories over\nintervals of time.\n\nThe `spending_limits` field within `spending_controls` is a list of objects that\nhave the following structure:\n\nFieldTypeDescription`amount`integerMaximum spend, in the currency of the card.\nAmounts in other currencies are converted to the card’s currency when evaluating\nthis control. This amount is in the card’s currency and in the [smallest\ncurrency\nunit](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#zero-decimal).`interval`enumTime\ninterval that the amount applies to. See the [Card\nspending_controls](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/object#issuing_card_object-spending_controls-spending_limits-interval)\nfor the possible values. All date-based intervals start at midnight\nUTC.`categories`array (optional)List of\n[categories](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/categories) this limit applies to.\nOmitting this field will apply the limit to all categories.\n#### Note\n\nIf you don’t set `spending_limits`, a default spending limit is applied to the\nnewly created card in the amount of 500 USD per day. [Contact\nSupport](https://support.stripe.com/contact/login) to disable this behavior.\n\n#### Note\n\nIn addition to the `spending_limits` configured on card, a default spending\nlimit in the amount of 10000 USD is also applied to each authorization. This\nisn’t configurable. [Contact Support](https://support.stripe.com/contact/login)\nto disable this behavior.\n\nA card’s spending limits apply across any cards it replaces (that is, its\n[replacement_for](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/object#issuing_card_object-replacement_for)\ncard and *that* card’s\n[replacement_for](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/object#issuing_card_object-replacement_for)\ncard, up the chain). A cardholder’s spending limits apply across all of their\ncards.\n\nEach spending limit only applies to its own categories. Spending limits alone do\nnot block categories and should be used with either `allowed_categories` or\n`blocked_categories` to restrict spending to specific business types.\n\nIf a cardholder has overlapping spending limits (for example, 100 USD per\nauthorization and 50 USD per authorization for their card), the most restrictive\nspending control applies.\n\nAdditional tips and fees can be [posted at a later\ntime](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/purchases/transactions?issuing-capture-type=over_capture),\ncausing a spending limit to be exceeded.\n\n## Examples\n\nThe following examples demonstrate different uses of spending controls for cards\nand cardholders.\n\nAPIDashboard\n### Limit a cardholder's monthly spend across all of their cards\n\n### Limit the spend and allowed categories for a cardholder\n\n### Limit a cardholder's weekly spend for specific categories\n\n## Links\n\n- [merchant categories](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/categories)\n-\n[countries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/object#issuing_authorization_object-merchant_data-country)\n- [merchant\nIDs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/object#issuing_authorization_object-merchant_data-network_id)\n-\n[Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/object#issuing_card_object-spending_controls)\n-\n[Cardholders](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cardholders/object#issuing_cardholder_object-spending_controls)\n-\n[objects](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/controls/spending-controls#spending-limits)\n- [real-time\nauthorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/controls/real-time-authorizations)\n- [smallest currency unit](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#zero-decimal)\n- [Card\nspending_controls](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/object#issuing_card_object-spending_controls-spending_limits-interval)\n- [Contact Support](https://support.stripe.com/contact/login)\n-\n[replacement_for](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/object#issuing_card_object-replacement_for)\n- [posted at a later\ntime](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/purchases/transactions?issuing-capture-type=over_capture)",
