  "content": "# Instant Bank Payments\n\n## Accept low cost bank payments with instant confirmation.\n\nAvailable in: \nInstant Bank Payments let your customers pay with a US bank account using Link.\nUnlike [ACH Direct Debit](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ach-direct-debit),\nInstant Bank Payments deliver instant confirmation and faster settlement,\nprotection from common ACH failures, and accelerated checkout.\n\nInstant Bank Payments are automatically enabled when you turn on\n[Link](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link), subject to\n[eligibility](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/instant-bank-payments#eligibility)\nrequirements. Go to your [payment method\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) to manage Link\nin your payment integrations. Not all businesses or transactions are eligible\nfor Instant Bank Payments.\n\nFor information about how your payment integration affects Link, see [Link in\ndifferent payment\nintegrations](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/link-payment-integrations).\n\n## Payment flow\n\nAt checkout, the Instant Bank Payment flow depends on whether the customer has a\nLink account.\n\n### Flow for new Link customers\n\n![Payment\npage](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/bank-tab.f68600e3dfe858e077d044c193e249c4.png)\n\nUnder **Payment details**, they select **Bank**, then search for and select\ntheir bank.\n\n![Link agreement\npage](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/consent.706738ec6793f218792313c32a2c08de.png)\n\nThey click **Agree and continue**.\n\n![Link login or sign up\npage](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/sign-up.1fac9f2a7f8ce0b02d6a00af60373dab.png)\n\nThey enter their email and click **Continue with Link**.\n\n![Bank login\npage](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/oauth.c007a2dbaa3206e732d4dd0b6c374af0.png)\n\nThey enter their bank login credentials and click **Submit**.\n\n![Link success\npage](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/success.cb45bc1cb44c0f1d8f8d8156497d5d64.png)\n\nThey click **Back to Powdur**.\n\nThe customer then returns to the payment details page and continues with their\nnew Link account.\n\n### Flow for existing Link customers\n\nWhen a customer with a Link account encounters Link at checkout, they have the\noption to pay with their saved bank account.\n\n![Payment\npage](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/bank-tab.f68600e3dfe858e077d044c193e249c4.png)\n\nUnder **Payment details**, they select **Bank**, then search for and select\ntheir bank.\n\n![Link Welcome Back\npage](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/returning.db06671ab9ed4b881e90398d52654d9a.png)\n\nThey enter their email and click **Continue with Link**.\n\n![2FA confirmation\npage](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/otp.16c215fdabb2443944f785b063cd4536.png)\n\nThey enter their 2FA confirmation code.\n\n![Link select account\npage](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/saved.b60f46f0013d166a37868d6b6ea3e011.png)\n\nThey select their saved bank account and click **Connect account**.\n\n![Link success\npage](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/success.cb45bc1cb44c0f1d8f8d8156497d5d64.png)\n\nThey click **Back to Powdur**.\n\nThe customer then completes the transaction.\n\n## Timing and guaranteed settlement\n\nConfirmation of Instant Bank Payments is immediate, and authorized payments\nsettle to your Stripe balance on the same timeline as card payments. Stripe\nguarantees that authorized payments settle to your account unless the customer\ninitiates a dispute with their bank.\n\n![2 day settlement\ntimeline](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/settlement-timing.be2862d8a51f4d6c1cc339371c7bc0d2.png)\n\nInstant Bank Payments are subject to two types of returns:\n\n- **Bank-initiated ACH returns**: Stripe still guarantees settlement and doesn’t\ndebit any funds from your balance.\n- **Customer-initiated disputes**: When your customer initiates a dispute with\ntheir bank, Stripe debits your balance for the payment amount and dispute fee.\nTo respond and provide supporting text and images, follow the same [guided\nprocess in your Stripe Dashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/responding)\nas for cardholder disputes.\n\n## Availability of Instant Bank Payments\n\nInstant Bank Payments are built into Link for users in the US. For eligible\ntransactions, your customers see Instant Bank Payments as a payment option.\n\nTo learn about using Link with dynamic payment methods and other integrations,\nsee [Link payment\nintegrations](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/link-payment-integrations).\nThe following payment integrations support Instant Bank Payments:\n\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout)\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n- [Hosted Invoice Page](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/hosted-invoice-page)\n- [Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements)\n- [Mobile Payment\nElement](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=ios&mobile-ui=payment-element)\n\n### Eligibility\n\nSome businesses and transactions aren’t eligible for Instant Bank Payments. In a\ngiven session, Instant Bank Payments appear as a payment option only when\ncertain risk criteria are met. Some examples include:\n\n- **Two-step authentication**: You must enable [two-step\nauthentication](https://support.stripe.com/questions/enable-two-step-authentication)\non your Stripe account.\n- **Onboarding criteria**: You must satisfy certain onboarding criteria,\nincluding, but not limited to, being a US business and having a history of\nStripe usage.\n- **Transaction limits**: Eligible transactions must be below an amount\ndynamically set by our risk systems. By default, Instant Bank Payments are\npresented only for transactions under $500.\n- **ACH Direct Debit**: If you have enabled ACH Direct Debit for a transaction,\nthen Link doesn’t present Instant Bank Payments as a payment option.\n\n### Interaction with ACH Direct Debit\n\nYou can’t present both [ACH Direct\nDebit](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ach-direct-debit) and Instant Bank\nPayments as payment options for the same transaction. If you enable both ACH\nDirect Debit and Instant Bank Payments, ACH Direct Debit takes precedence at\ncheckout:\n\n- When creating a [Checkout\nSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object#checkout_session_object-payment_method_types),\n[PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-payment_method_types),\nor\n[SetupIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents/create#create_setup_intent-payment_method_types),\nif you explicitly offer ACH Direct Debit by including `us_bank_account` in\n`payment_method_types`, Link never presents Instant Bank Payments as a payment\noption.\n- When using [dynamic payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/dynamic-payment-methods),\nfor any transaction that’s eligible for ACH Direct Debit, Link doesn’t present\nInstant Bank Payments as a payment option. However, you can restrict ACH Direct\nDebit eligibility by configuring a [payment method\nrule](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-method-rules). For all\ntransactions that don’t meet the ACH rule criteria but that are eligible for\nInstant Bank Payments, Link presents Instant Bank Payments as a payment option.\n\nWe recommend ACH Direct Debit for businesses that don’t immediately fulfill\ngoods and services, and that can wait up to 4 business days to confirm a\npayment.\n\n## Testing\n\nStripe provides a set of test institutions and bank accounts to simulate various\nsuccess and failure scenarios.\n\n### Simulate successful bank account connection\n\n- **Payment Success**: Simulates a successful bank account connection and an\nauthorized payment.\n- **Success (Later Disputed)**: Simulates a successful bank account connection\nand an authorized payment, then generates a customer-initiated dispute. You can\nview the dispute in the Dashboard.\n- **Payment Blocked**: Simulates a successful bank account connection and a\npayment that Stripe declines due to elevated risk.\n\n### Simulate failed bank account connection\n\n- **Down Bank (Scheduled)**: The institution’s login API is unavailable for a\nknown time period that the institution communicated to Stripe.\n- **Down Bank (Unscheduled)**: The institution’s login API is unavailable\nwithout any information about the downtime communicated to Stripe.\n- **Down Bank (Error)**: Stripe is experiencing an unknown error communicating\nwith the institution.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Link with Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/checkout-link)\n- [Link with Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/elements-link)\n- [Link with Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/invoicing)\n\n## Links\n\n- [ACH Direct Debit](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ach-direct-debit)\n- [Link](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link)\n- [payment method\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods)\n- [Link in different payment\nintegrations](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/link-payment-integrations)\n- [guided process in your Stripe\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/responding)\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout)\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n- [Hosted Invoice Page](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/hosted-invoice-page)\n- [Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements)\n- [Mobile Payment\nElement](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=ios&mobile-ui=payment-element)\n- [two-step\nauthentication](https://support.stripe.com/questions/enable-two-step-authentication)\n- [Checkout\nSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object#checkout_session_object-payment_method_types)\n-\n[PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-payment_method_types)\n-\n[SetupIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents/create#create_setup_intent-payment_method_types)\n- [dynamic payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/dynamic-payment-methods)\n- [payment method rule](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-method-rules)\n- [Link with Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/checkout-link)\n- [Link with Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/elements-link)\n- [Link with Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/invoicing)",
