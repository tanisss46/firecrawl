  "content": "# OAuth changes for platform-controlled Standard accounts\n\n## Learn about the changes Stripe has made to OAuth for Connect.\n\nWe’ve updated OAuth to isolate platforms’ processing activity on\nplatform-controlled Standard accounts. Platforms using OAuth with `read_write`\nscope can’t connect to Standard accounts that are controlled by another\nplatform. Prior to June 2021, multiple platforms could connect to the same\nStandard account.\n\nThis change ensures that in the rare case that a\n[Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect) user with access to the Stripe\nDashboard interacts with two platforms, each platform’s activity is kept\ndistinct in separate Standard accounts.\n\nWhen a user of a Standard account controlled by another platform connects to\nyour platform, the Connect onboarding flow directs them to create a separate\nStandard account to use with your platform. The new account automatically\nconnects to your platform.\n\nIf you registered your Connect application as an [Extension\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/building-extensions), it can still connect\nto accounts that are connected to another platform. Extensions need to connect\nto existing Standard accounts that might also be connected to another Platform\nor Extension. Only Extensions can use `read_only`, which ensures that platforms\ncan’t read other applications’ data.\n\nHowever, if you previously selected `Platform` for your Connect application and\nyou now need Extension functionality, you must [contact\nus](https://support.stripe.com/contact/email?topic=connect) to modify your\nintegration selection. You can find your selection in the [Connect\nSettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/platform-profile) under\n**Availability**.\n\n## Links\n\n- [configured with\nproperties](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/update-to-typeless-connect)\n- [platform\ncontrols](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/platform-controls-for-standard-accounts)\n- [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)\n- [Extension integration](https://docs.stripe.com/building-extensions)\n- [contact us](https://support.stripe.com/contact/email?topic=connect)\n- [Connect\nSettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/platform-profile)",
