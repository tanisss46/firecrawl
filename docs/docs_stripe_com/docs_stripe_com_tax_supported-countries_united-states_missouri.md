# Collect tax in Missouri

## Learn how to use Stripe Tax to calculate, collect, and report tax in Missouri.

## When to register for tax collection

See [Thresholds](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/thresholds) to get insights
about your potential tax registration obligations in Missouri. Stripe also
notifies you with email and Dashboard alerts when you need to register to
collect tax. Learn more about how the [monitoring tool
works](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/monitoring).

Remote sellers must register to collect and remit tax in Missouri when, in the
previous or current calendar year, they exceed a sales threshold of 100,000 USD.

The threshold includes taxable sales of tangible personal property. The
threshold excludes sales of services, nontaxable sales of tangible personal
property, wholesale sales (sales for resale), and marketplace sales.

## How we calculate taxes

If your [origin address](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/set-up#origin-address) is
in the US and differs from your customer’s state, Stripe always calculates tax
based on your customer’s location.

If your customer is in Missouri and your origin address is also in Missouri,
Stripe applies tax based on your origin address, depending on the type of
product or service you sell.

## Report and file your taxes

Stripe provides reports of your completed tax transactions. Go to
[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations) to access these
reports.

### Exports

The tax transaction data export provides a comprehensive and aggregated view of
transactions by location, including a breakdown of individual tax amounts. Learn
more about [tax reporting exports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports#exports).

### Location reports

[Location reports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports#us-location-reports)
offer a summary of transaction and refund data for specific US locations and
align with Missouri filing requirements. You have the option to report on an
annual, quarterly, or monthly basis.

### Filing

Stripe Tax has filing partners—Taxually, Marosa, and Hands-off Sales Tax
(HOST)—to help automate your tax filing. These partners automatically sync your
tax transaction data in real time, eliminating the need for manual data entry or
file transfers. Learn more about [tax
filing](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/filing).
