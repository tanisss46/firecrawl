  "content": "# Send events to Amazon EventBridge\n\n## Consume Stripe events in your AWS infrastructure.\n\n#### Enable Workbench\n\nTo send events to Amazon EventBridge, enable Workbench in your [Developer\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/developers) in the Dashboard.\n\n[Amazon\nEventBridge](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-what-is.html)\nis a serverless, event-driven service provided by AWS that helps connect your\napplications together by ingesting, transforming, and delivering events.\nIntegrating with EventBridge using an event destination allows you to receive\nevent data from Stripe directly in your AWS account, instead of handling the\ntraffic and managing integration code logic yourself. When events are received,\nEventBridge can route them to [20 supported\ntargets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-targets.html)\nto process or trigger business automations.\n\n## Send events to Amazon EventBridge\n\nComplete the steps below to receive events in EventBridge. This involves\ncreating a new event destination in Workbench and setting up EventBridge\nconfiguration in the [AWS Management\nConsole](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/gsg/learn-whats-new.html).\n\n#### Warning\n\nYou won’t receive any event data in your Amazon EventBridge until you complete\neach step.\n\n[Add a new event\ndestinationWorkbench](https://docs.stripe.com/event-destinations/eventbridge#add-eventbridge-destination)\n#### Send events in your sandbox\n\nUse your live account or [sandboxes](https://docs.stripe.com/sandboxes) to send\nevents to Amazon EventBridge.\n\nCreate an event destination using Workbench in the Dashboard or programmatically\nwith the [API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/v2/event-destinations).\n\nDashboardAPI\nTo create an event destination in the Dashboard:\n\n- Open the [Webhooks](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks) tab in Workbench.\n- Click **Create new destination**.\n- Select where you want to receive events from. Stripe supports two types of\nconfigurations: **Your account** and [Connected\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect). Select **Account** to listen to\nevents from your own account. If you created a [Connect\napplication](https://docs.stripe.com/connect) and want to listen to events from\nyour connected accounts, select **Connected accounts**.\n- Select the [event types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types) that you\nwant this destination to receive. Then, click **Continue**.\n- Select **Amazon EventBridge** as your destination type, then click\n**Continue**.\n- Enter the following information:- [AWS account\nID](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/manage-acct-identifiers.html):\nThe AWS account that hosts your EventBridge instance for receiving events.\n- [AWS\nregion](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/): The\nAWS region that hosts your EventBridge instance for receiving events.\n- *(Optional)* **Destination name**: A unique name of this event destination\nresource in Stripe. If you don’t provide one, we generate a random name for you.\nYou can change it later.\n- *(Optional)* **Description**: A description that distinguishes your event\ndestination instance. You can modify this later.\n- Click **Create destination**.\n\n![Register a new webhook using the Webhooks\ntab](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/create-webhook.f728025897e9e4ca2ba623abe34995a0.png)\n\nRegister a new webhook in the **Webhooks** tab\n\n[Associate the partner event sourceAWS\nConsole](https://docs.stripe.com/event-destinations/eventbridge#associate-partner-event-source)\nAfter you set up an event destination, Stripe creates a [partner event\nsource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/APIReference/API_EventSource.html)\nin the AWS account and region you provided during configuration. To start\nreceiving events, you need to associate this event source with an [event\nbus](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-event-bus.html)\nwithin 7 days of the event destination’s creation. If you don’t associate it\nwithin this time frame, Amazon automatically deletes the pending event source.\nAfter an event source is deleted, your Stripe event destination is automatically\ndisabled and you must create a new destination to receive events.\n\n- Under **EventBridge** in your [AWS\nconsole](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/gsg/learn-whats-new.html),\nnavigate to the [Partner event sources\npage](https://console.aws.amazon.com/events/home#/partners) that’s listed in the\n**Integration** section of the left-hand panel.\n\n![Navigate to **Partner event\nsources**](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/aws-select-partner-event-source.14ff917248eeb4f333195e6b3a431447.png)\n\n- Use the **Region** dropdown list located at the top of the console to select\nthe region you chose when configuring your [event destination in\nWorkbench](https://docs.stripe.com/event-destinations/eventbridge#add-eventbridge-destination).\n\n![Select your AWS\nregion](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/aws-region.6a68960287ba6356f8e856501295a039.png)\n\n- Choose the newly created partner event source in the dropdown. To find the\nEvent Source ARN field in Workbench, select your event destination. Your partner\nsource matches the part of the ARN that reads\n`event-source/aws.partner/stripe.com/{UNIQUE_ID}`. Then, click **Associate with\nevent bus**.\n\n![Associate the partner event source with event\nbus](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/aws-associate-partner-event-source.c89d540961356ff06e3fb095956ba80f.png)\n\n- Select permissions you want to grant for this event bus as needed, then click\n**Associate**.\n\n![Select permissions and finalize\nassociation](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/aws-associate-event-bus.28dcbc4781d814799076258c8f1b9a04.png)\n\n[Create EventBridge rulesAWS\nConsole](https://docs.stripe.com/event-destinations/eventbridge#create-evenbridge-rule)\nEventBridge groups and routes events based on\n[rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-rules.html)\nyou define. After you create an event destination and associate its partner\nevent source to an event bus, you must define rules to make sure that\nEventBridge knows how to handle the events it receives on the event bus. You can\nrepeat these steps multiple times to define multiple rules.\n\n- Navigate to the AWS management console, then click\n[Rules](https://console.aws.amazon.com/events/home#/events).\n\n![Navigate to\n**Rules**](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/aws-select-rules.f385d0e668caafc9614584e2ae635138.png)\n\n- Click **Create Rule**, then provide a rule name and description.\n\n![Provide rule name and\ndescription](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/aws-define-rule.ce885bcbea4d7492f082eba2f38fd840.png)\n\n- Select your event bus from the dropdown. To find your event bus, navigate to\nWorkbench, select your destination in the **Webhooks** tab, then view the\n**Event source ARN** field, which shares the same name as your event source ARN.\nThen, click **Next**.\n- Under **Event source**, select **AWS events or EventBridge partner events**\nbecause Stripe events are partner events.\n\n![Select event\nsource](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/aws-event-source.29ee4d4e795b0f7d89db7163ab7b9ac5.png)\n\n- *(Optional)* Include a sample Stripe event.\n- Under **Creation Method**, choose **Use pattern form** to use a predefined\npattern. Alternatively, you can create a custom event pattern.\n\n![Use a predefined rule\npatter](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/aws-create-rule-pattern.3246a6c5a409b1b0571f56acc6e7b91b.png)\n\n- Under **Event Pattern**, select **EventBridge partners** as the **Event\nSource**.\n- Under **Event Pattern**, select **Stripe** as the **Partner**.\n- Select the appropriate event type you want to create a rule for or select\n**All events** to match this rule to all event types, then click **Next**.\n- Select the\n[target](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-targets.html)\nyou want this rule to send events to, then click **Next**.\n\n#### Recommendation\n\nWe recommend you [create a CloudWatch Logs\ntarget](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/cloudwatch-log-group-eventbridge)\nfor each event bus to enable monitoring for your event destination. Consider\nusing other [common architecture\npatterns](https://docs.stripe.com/event-destinations/eventbridge#common-architecture)\nwith EventBridge and Stripe events.\n\n![Select rule\ntarget](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/aws-select-target.d9da569a26cf0d6fcc81f753b16d0e60.png)\n\n- Add optional tags, then click **Next**.\n- Review your rule and make changes as needed, then click **Create Rule**.\n\nYour Stripe events are now successfully delivered to EventBridge and its\ncorresponding targets defined in your rule.\n\n## Trigger test events\n\nTo send test events, trigger an event type that your webhook is subscribed to by\nmanually creating an object in the Stripe Dashboard. Alternatively, you can use\nthe following command in either [Stripe\nShell](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-shell/overview) or [Stripe\nCLI](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli).\n\nThis example triggers a `payment_intent.succeeded` event:\n\n```\nstripe trigger payment_intent.succeeded\nRunning fixture for: payment_intent\nTrigger succeeded! Check dashboard for event details.\n```\n\nLearn how to trigger events with [Stripe for VS\nCode](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-vscode).\n\n## Event delivery behaviors\n\nThis section helps you understand different behaviors to expect regarding how\nStripe sends events to Amazon EventBridge.\n\n### Automatic retries\n\nStripe attempts to deliver events to your destination for up to three days with\nan exponential back off in live mode. View when the next retry will occur, if\napplicable, in your event destination’s **Event deliveries** tab. We retry event\ndeliveries created in a sandbox three times over the course of a few hours. If\nyour destination has been disabled or deleted when we attempt a retry, we\nprevent future retries of that event. However, if you disable and then re-enable\nthe event destination before we’re able to retry, you still see future retry\nattempts.\n\n### Manual retries\n\nThere are two ways to manually retry events:\n\n- In the Stripe Dashboard, click **Resend** when looking at a specific event.\nThis works for up to 15 days after the event creation.\n- With the [Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/cli/events/resend), run the\n`stripe events resend <event_id> --webhook-endpoint=<endpoint_id>` command. This\nworks for up to 30 days after the event creation.\n\n### Event ordering\n\nStripe doesn’t guarantee the delivery of events in the order that they’re\ngenerated. For example, creating a subscription might generate the following\nevents:\n\n- `customer.subscription.created`\n- `invoice.created`\n- `invoice.paid`\n- `charge.created` (if there’s a charge)\n\nMake sure that your event destination isn’t dependent on receiving events in a\nspecific order. Be prepared to manage their delivery appropriately. You can also\nuse the API to retrieve any missing objects. For example, you can retrieve the\ninvoice, charge, and subscription objects with the information from\n`invoice.paid` if you receive this event first.\n\n### API versioning\n\nThe API version in your account settings when the event occurs dictates the API\nversion, and therefore the structure of an\n[Event](https://docs.stripe.com/api/v1/events) sent to your destination. For\nexample, if your account is set to an older API version, such as 2015-02-16, and\nyou change the API version for a specific request with\n[versioning](https://docs.stripe.com/api#versioning), the\n[Event](https://docs.stripe.com/api/v1/events) object generated and sent to your\ndestination is still based on the 2015-02-16 API version. You can’t change\n[Event](https://docs.stripe.com/api/v1/events) objects after creation. For\nexample, if you update a charge, the original charge event remains unchanged. As\na result, subsequent updates to your account’s API version don’t retroactively\nalter existing [Event](https://docs.stripe.com/api/v1/events) objects.\nRetrieving an older [Event](https://docs.stripe.com/api/v1/events) by calling\n`/v1/events` using a newer API version also has no impact on the structure of\nthe received event. You can set test event destinations to either your default\nAPI version or the latest API version. The\n[Event](https://docs.stripe.com/api/v1/events) sent to the destination is\nstructured for the event destination’s specified version.\n\n## Event destination status\n\nAmazon EventBridge destinations have several statuses that describe their\nreadiness to receive events:\n\n- **Active**: You have successfully associated the event destination with an\nevent bus. If you configure an EventBridge rule correctly, you receive the\nevents in your chosen event consumers.\n- **Disabled**: Stripe isn’t sending events to Amazon EventBridge. Your\ndestination will be in this status either because you manually disabled it or\nStripe automatically disabled it due to an AWS misconfiguration.\n- **Pending**: After the event destination successfully creates a partner event\nsource in AWS, you need to associate that event source with an event bus. The\ndestination remains in a pending state and won’t receive any events until you\nmake this association, at which point the status of the destination changes to\nactive.\n\n## Event structure\n\nEventBridge uses its own [event\nstructure](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-events-structure.html)\nthat wraps the Stripe `event` JSON object within a top-level `detail` field.\n\nThis example is a `customer.created` event payload from EventBridge:\n\n```\n{\n \"version\":\"0\",\n \"id\":\"17e8dff5-d6cd-3770-ace9-aeac02b6ac3f\",\n \"detail-type\":\"customer.created\",\n\n\"source\":\"aws.partner/stripe.com/ed_61PgtRTG5aTCIz98516PLsRGLISQK0Otk6FWKjBrcDia\",\n \"account\":\"506417113029\",\n \"time\":\"2024-03-07T18:27:56Z\",\n \"region\":\"us-west-2\",\n \"resources\":[\n```\n\nSee all 60 lines\n## Support events types where Stripe waits for a response\n\nStripe sends most event types asynchronously; however, for certain event types,\nStripe waits for a response. The presence or absence of a response from the\nevent destination directly influences Stripe’s actions regarding these specific\nevent types.\n\nAmazon EventBridge destinations offer limited support for event types that\nrequire a response:\n\n- You can’t subscribe to the `issuing_authorization.request` event type for\nAmazon EventBridge destinations. Instead, set up a [webhook\nendpoint](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) to subscribe to this event type. Use\n`issuing_authorization.request` to authorize purchase requests in real-time.\nThis requires your destination to approve or decline requests by responding to\nthe event. EventBridge handles the response to Stripe before sending it to your\nconsumers. As a result, this destination type can’t use this event type to\nauthorize any payments.\n- You can subscribe to `checkout_sessions.completed` when using Amazon\nEventBridge. However, this doesn’t [handle redirect\nbehavior](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/fulfillment#redirect-hosted-checkout)\nwhen you embed [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout) directly in\nyour website or redirect customers to a Stripe-hosted payment page. Delivering a\n`checkout_sessions.completed` event to Amazon EventBridge won’t affect redirect\nbehavior. To influence Checkout redirect behavior, process this event type with\na [webhook endpoint](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks).\n\n## Common architecture patterns with EventBridge and Stripe events\n\nConsider the following architectural patterns when you use Amazon EventBridge\nwith Stripe:\n\n- **Trigger serverless functions with Lambda to define business automations**:\nSend Stripe events from EventBridge to Lambda to trigger serverless compute\nfunctions, such as creating a shipping label after a payment succeeds.\n- **Enable event monitoring with CloudWatch**: Send events from EventBridge to\nCloudWatch Logs to store events as log data that you can interactively search\nand analyze. Monitor usage patterns and errors with CloudWatch. Consider setting\nup alerts for errors (for example, when an EventBridge rule is broken).\n- **Trigger low and no code workflows with Step Functions**: Send events to a\nStepFunction workflow that trigger your business scenarios, such as notifying\nyour customers that their trial is about to end.\n- **Fan out events to internal systems with Simple Notification Service (SNS) or\nSimple Queue Service (SQS)**: Send Stripe events to SNS or SQS to fan out Stripe\nevent data to your internal teams to make sure that they can own and process\nthem.\n\n## See also\n\n- [List of thin event\ntypes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/v2/core/events/event-types)\n- [List of snapshot event types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/)\n- [Event destinations overview](https://docs.stripe.com/event-destinations)\n- [Send events to webhook endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Developer settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/developers)\n- [Amazon\nEventBridge](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-what-is.html)\n- [20 supported\ntargets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-targets.html)\n- [AWS Management\nConsole](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/gsg/learn-whats-new.html)\n- [sandboxes](https://docs.stripe.com/sandboxes)\n- [API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/v2/event-destinations)\n- [Webhooks](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)\n- [Connected accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)\n- [event types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types)\n- [AWS account\nID](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/manage-acct-identifiers.html)\n- [AWS\nregion](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/)\n- [partner event\nsource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/APIReference/API_EventSource.html)\n- [event\nbus](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-event-bus.html)\n- [Partner event sources\npage](https://console.aws.amazon.com/events/home#/partners)\n- [event destination in\nWorkbench](https://docs.stripe.com/event-destinations/eventbridge#add-eventbridge-destination)\n-\n[rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-rules.html)\n- [Rules](https://console.aws.amazon.com/events/home#/events)\n- [create a CloudWatch Logs\ntarget](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/cloudwatch-log-group-eventbridge)\n- [common architecture\npatterns](https://docs.stripe.com/event-destinations/eventbridge#common-architecture)\n- [Stripe Shell](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-shell/overview)\n- [Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli)\n- [Stripe for VS Code](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-vscode)\n- [Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/cli/events/resend)\n- [Event](https://docs.stripe.com/api/v1/events)\n- [versioning](https://docs.stripe.com/api#versioning)\n- [event\nstructure](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-events-structure.html)\n- [webhook endpoint](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks)\n- [handle redirect\nbehavior](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/fulfillment#redirect-hosted-checkout)\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout)\n- [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)\n- [CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)\n- [Step Functions](https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/)\n- [Simple Notification Service (SNS)](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/)\n- [Simple Queue Service (SQS)](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/)\n- [List of thin event\ntypes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/v2/core/events/event-types)\n- [List of snapshot event types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/)\n- [Event destinations overview](https://docs.stripe.com/event-destinations)",
