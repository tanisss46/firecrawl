It provides transactional reports to help with tax\nreporting and filing for your platform or your connected accounts.\n\nThe first step for using Stripe Tax with Connect requires you to **determine\nwhich entity has the obligation to collect and report taxes**. The entity that’s\nliable for tax might be you or your connected account, depending on your\nbusiness model, regulations (for example, [marketplace laws in the US and\nEU](https://stripe.com/en-nl/guides/guide-to-sales-tax-and-vat-for-marketplace-sellers)),\nor the transaction details, such as the order amount or the type of goods being\nsold.\n\n## Use cases\n\nStripe Tax is designed to support different multi-party use cases:\n\nUse caseUse whenExamples[Tax for software\nplatforms](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-for-platforms)- You’re a SaaS\nplatform that enables other businesses with software services to reach their\ncustomers.\n- Your *connected accounts* assume responsibility for collecting and remitting\ntaxes.\n- An e-commerce platform like Shopify or Squarespace that enables businesses to\nbuild their own online stores to sell directly to customers.\n[Tax for marketplaces](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-for-marketplaces)- You’re\na marketplace that connects buyers and sellers on a single platform, typically\nthrough websites or apps where products are listed by various third-party\nvendors.\n- Your *platform* assumes responsibility for collecting and remitting taxes.\n- An e-commerce marketplace like Etsy or Amazon that allows a single shopping\ncart for goods sold by multiple businesses.\n\n[Stripe Connect’s distinction between SaaS platforms and\nmarketplaces](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/how-connect-works#use-cases)\ndoesn’t strictly correspond to the tax definition of marketplaces that are\nresponsible for tax collection.
