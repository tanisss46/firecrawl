# Standalone Tax Connector for Adobe CommercePublic preview

## Automate tax collection and reporting on Adobe Commerce with non-Stripe payment solutions.

#### Public preview

The standalone Stripe Tax connector for Adobe Commerce is currently available as
a public preview and works with any payments provider. Please [Reach out to
us](mailto:adobe-commerce-stripe-tax-rc@stripe.com) if you’re interested in
joining the beta.

Use the Stripe Tax module for Adobe Commerce to calculate, collect, and report
taxes on payments made through any supported Adobe Commerce payment method.

Compared to the native Adobe Commerce tax engine, Stripe Tax provides a simpler
configuration and activation process. Because Stripe Tax is dynamic, you don’t
need to reconfigure Adobe Commerce when tax rates change for specific product
types, locations, or time periods. Stripe continuously updates your local tax
rules and automatically calculates the correct tax amount.

## Availability

To use Stripe Tax with Adobe Commerce, your business must be based in one of the
[supported countries](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries).

Minimum system requirements include PHP 7.4, and at least version 2.3.7 or later
of Magento 2 and Adobe Commerce.

## Configuration

You can configure the general settings for Stripe Tax in Adobe Commerce on the
Tax configuration page.

### General settings

To access your general settings in the admin panel of your Adobe Commerce store:

- Navigate to **Stores** > **Settings** > **Configuration**.
- In the Sales section, select **Stripe Tax**.

The following settings are available for configuration:

- **Enabled**: Set to `Yes` to activate Stripe Tax for your store. This enables
the module to start calculating, collecting, and reporting taxes.
- **Mode**: Select **Test** to use test credentials for testing the integration
without affecting real transactions. Switch to **Live** when you’re ready to
calculate taxes in a production environment.
- **Publishable API key**: Enter your publishable API key obtained from your
[Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys).
- **Secret API key**: Enter your secret API key from your [Stripe
Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys).
- **Product prices and promotions**: Configure how to calculate product price
taxes and discount amount taxes. Set this to either `Tax exclusive` or `Tax
inclusive` depending on your store’s pricing strategy. If you select **Tax
exclusive**, product prices configured from the admin panel, or discounts
applied on the cart don’t include tax. If you select **Tax inclusive**, the
product prices and discounts already include tax.
- **Shipping is**: Determine how shipping is taxed. Select either **Tax free**,
**Tax exclusive**, or **Tax inclusive** based on whether and how you want
shipping costs to include tax.

### Product tax classes

You can manage product tax classes to make sure that your products are
categorized correctly for tax calculation purposes.

To add, edit, or remove product tax classes in your Adobe Commerce store:

- From the admin panel, navigate to **Stores** > **Taxes** > **Stripe Tax
Classes** to open the Stripe Tax Classes page where you can manage your tax
classes.
- To add a new tax class, click **Add a new tax class** at the bottom of the
Stripe Tax Classes page. This opens a modal where you can select a tax category.
Each category represents a specific product tax code. Select the one you want to
use for your products, then click **Add**.
- You can edit an existing Tax Class if your products are already assigned to
tax classes from before you installed Stripe Tax. This allows you to keep those
existing tax classes, and assign a product tax code to them. To do so, click
**Select** in the **Actions** column next to the tax class you want to edit.
Choose **Set category** to assign a new category to the tax class.
- To rename a tax class, click its name. This opens a modal where you can set a
new tax class name. Alternatively, you can expand the **Select** options list
from the **Actions** column and click **Rename** or **Delete**.
- Changes to the tax classes aren’t saved automatically. To save your changes,
click **Save Changes**.
- After you configure your tax classes, you can use them to apply tax classes on
products:
- From any product edit page, you can configure the product’s tax class using
the **Tax Class** dropdown. The tax classes you’ve added appear on the product
edit page.
- Alternatively, you can use the Tax configuration page to set the default tax
classes for products when they haven’t been assigned a tax class, or when their
tax class has been deleted.

### Tax registrations

Before you can perform live tax calculations, you need to add tax registrations
in your Stripe Dashboard. You can add tax registrations manually in the [Tax
registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/tax/registrations) section, or
through the [Tax thresholds](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/tax/thresholds)
section. During the tax registration steps, you can choose between immediate
registration, or schedule the registration to begin at a date in the future if
you’re planning to register. Stripe Tax only calculates and collects tax on
transactions in these locations.

If you start selling to a new country or tax jurisdiction, Stripe can
automatically let you know if you need to register for tax in that jurisdiction.
This typically happens when your sales volume exceeds the tax threshold of that
tax authority. If you have existing transactions on Stripe, you can use our
[monitoring tool](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/thresholds) to understand
where you might need to register.

## Refunds and tax reversals

A tax reversal is triggered when you create a credit memo from the admin area of
Adobe Commerce. The tax reversal will be triggered in both cases of creating an
Online credit memo or an Offline credit memo.

- **Refund Offline**: This creates a tax reversal without refunding the payment.
- **Refund**: This creates a tax reversal and refunds the payment online via
Stripe.

In cases where the credit memo does not include all of the order items (partial
credit memos), then the tax reversal will be triggered only for the items on the
partial credit memo.

#### Caution

Please be advised that the credit memo’s “Adjustment Fee” and “Adjustment
Refund” fields are never taken into consideration during tax reversals.

## Export tax transactions

If you are in a country where automatic tax reporting is not yet supported, you
can export your tax transactions from [Tax
registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations)

- Click on the country for which you’d like to export tax transactions.
- Click the “Export transactions” button at the top right of the registration
page.
- Select the date range and columns you’d like to export.
- Click the “Export” button to download the transactions in CSV format.
