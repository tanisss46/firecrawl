After the connected account’s service agreement is\naccepted, the type of service agreement can’t be modified.\n\n### Full service agreement\n\nA `full` service agreement creates a service relationship between Stripe and the\nconnected account holder. Connected accounts under the `full` service agreement\ncan process card payments and request the\n[card_payments](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities#card-payments)\ncapability.\n\nFor the legal language, see the [Stripe Connected Account\nAgreement](https://stripe.com/connect-account/legal/full).\n\n### Recipient service agreement\n\nA `recipient` service agreement clarifies that there is no service relationship\nbetween Stripe and the recipient, and that the recipient’s relationship is with\nthe platform. Connected accounts under the recipient service agreement can’t\nprocess payments or request the `card_payments` capability.\n\nTransfers to `recipient` accounts take an extra 24 hours to become available in\nthe connected account’s balance. To learn more about `pending` balances, see the\n[account balances](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-balances) page.\n\n[Cross-border payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/cross-border-payouts)\nonly work with accounts under the `recipient` service agreement. You must\nexplicitly pass in the country code if it differs from the platform country.\n\nStripe isn’t responsible for providing direct support for accounts on the\n`recipient` service agreement. However, the platform can reach out to Stripe for\nsupport for these accounts.\n\nFor the legal language, see the [Stripe Recipient\nAgreement](https://stripe.com/connect-account/legal/recipient).\n\n## Choosing the agreement type\n\nYou can specify the agreement type through the\n[Accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts) API.\n\n### Accounts API\n\nTo choose a `recipient` service agreement when [creating an\naccount](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_account), specify the agreement type\nwith\n[tos_acceptance[service_agreement]](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-tos_acceptance):\n\nWith controller propertiesWith account type\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d country=US \\\n -d \"controller[stripe_dashboard][type]\"=none \\\n -d \"controller[fees][payer]\"=application \\\n -d \"controller[losses][payments]\"=application \\\n -d \"controller[requirement_collection]\"=application \\\n -d \"capabilities[transfers][requested]\"=true \\\n -d \"tos_acceptance[service_agreement]\"=recipient\n```\n\nThe same principle applies when [updating an\naccount](https://docs.stripe.com/api#update_account):\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts/{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}} \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d \"tos_acceptance[service_agreement]\"=recipient\n```\n\n#### Caution\n\nChanging the service agreement type fails if the service agreement has already\nbeen accepted; in those cases, create a new account with the desired service\nagreement.\n\n### Connect Configuration settings\n\nTo choose a `recipient` service agreement for connected accounts with access to\nthe Express Dashboard, select the **Transfers** option with the **Restricted\nCapability Access** icon in the [Configuration\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/applications/settings/express)\nsection of the Stripe Dashboard.\n\nYou can override the Configuration settings for an individual account by\nspecifying its capabilities and service agreement type with the Accounts API.\n\n## Accepting the correct agreement\n\nStripe handles the service agreement acceptance if you use [Stripe-hosted\nonboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/hosted-onboarding) or [Embedded\nonboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/embedded-onboarding). For [API\nonboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/api-onboarding), the platform must\nattest that their user has seen and accepted the service agreement. See [service\nagreement\nacceptance](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/updating-service-agreements#tos-acceptance)\nfor more information.\n\n## Links\n\n- [service agreement\ntype](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-tos_acceptance)\n- [capabilities](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities)\n-\n[card_payments](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities#card-payments)\n- [Stripe Connected Account\nAgreement](https://stripe.com/connect-account/legal/full)\n- [account balances](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-balances)\n- [Cross-border payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/cross-border-payouts)\n- [Stripe Recipient\nAgreement](https://stripe.com/connect-account/legal/recipient)\n- [Accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts)\n- [creating an account](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_account)\n- [updating an account](https://docs.stripe.com/api#update_account)\n- [Configuration\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/applications/settings/express)\n- [Stripe-hosted onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/hosted-onboarding)\n- [Embedded onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/embedded-onboarding)\n- [API onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/api-onboarding)\n- [service agreement\nacceptance](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/updating-service-agreements#tos-acceptance)",
