# By default, coupons no longer apply to invoice items with negative amountsBreaking changes

## What’s new

Updates coupons so they no longer apply to negative invoice items by default.
Previously, coupons applied to all non-proration invoice items. To allow a
coupon to apply to a negative invoice item, pass `discountable=true` when
creating or updating the invoice item.

## Impact

Coupons no longer apply to negative invoice items by default, preventing
unexpected discounts.
