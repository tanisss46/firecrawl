  "content": "# Data reconciliation with Stripe reports\n\n## Learn how to reconcile Revenue Recognition data with other financial reports.\n\nYou can reconcile the cash account from Revenue Recognition and the **Balance\nchange from activity** report within the same month. Because Revenue Recognition\nfocuses on revenue-generating activities, you must exclude fees, network costs,\ncontributions, and financing paydowns from the **Balance change from activity**\nreport before reconciling. To get the cash amount in Revenue Recognition,\ndownload the balance sheet report in the summary format.\n\n#### Note\n\nThe balance sheet report doesn’t take corrections into account. If there were\ncorrections issued for the month for which you’re attempting to reconcile\nreports, you must also consider the Revenue Recognition corrections summary\nreports for all subsequent months. Any corrections that would have been booked\nto the `original_accounting_period` of the reconciliation month must be factored\ninto the Revenue Recognition cash amount.\n\n## Example\n\nAs an example, the balance sheet report might look like the following, with a\n100 USD amount:\n\naccountcurrencynet changeCashusd+100.00Casheur+15.00\nTo get the cash amount in the **Balance change from activity** report, set the\ncurrency to USD, and the report timezone to UTC.\n\nAfter downloading the report in the summary format, it might look like the\nfollowing:\n\nreporting\ncategorycurrencygross`charge`usd+140.00`refund`usd-40.00`refund_failure`usd+20.00`partial_capture_reversal`usd-20.00`fee`usd-10.00`network_cost`usd-10.00`contribution`usd-10.00`financing_paydown`usd-10.00`total`usd+60.00\nThe total gross amount excludes some Stripe fees. After deducting rows for\nadditional Stripe fees, network costs, contributions, and financing paydowns,\nthe calculated cash amount is 100 USD.\n\n## Journal entries\n\nThe journal entries in the **Debits and credits** report don’t consider fees,\nnetwork costs, contributions, and financing paydowns. However, you can use\nStripe fees in your Revenue Recognition reporting to create journal entries for\nthese items.\n\n#### Note\n\nTo enable Stripe fees support in Revenue Recognition, [create a\nticket](https://support.stripe.com/contact/email?topic=financial_reports) on our\nsupport page. When you enable this feature, the journal entries in the **Debits\nand credits** report automatically incorporate fees, network costs, and\ncontributions.\n\nWith Stripe fees enabled, you can do the following to reconcile Revenue\nRecognition fees with the [Balance change from\nactivity](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/balance) report:\n\n- Download the **Balance change from activity** report in the summary format.\nMake sure you select these columns: **Reporting Category**, **Gross**, and\n**Fee**.\n- Calculate the total fee by summing the values in these columns:- **Gross**\ncolumn: fee, network cost, and contribution\n- **Fee** column: total\n\nIn the following example, you calculate the total fees: `-1000.00 + -0.50 +\n-0.40 + -1.00` to get the sum: `-1001.90`.\n\nreporting categorygrossfee`charge`100.00-4.00`refund`-100.003.00`platform\nearning refund`-0.100.00`fee`-1000.000.00`network\ncost`-0.500.00`contribution`-0.400.00`total`-1001.00-1.00\nIf you download the **Debits and credits** report in the summary format, you can\nsee `1001.90` debited from the Fees expense account and credited to the Cash\naccount.\n\ndebitcreditamountFeesCash1001.90\n#### Note\n\nThe debits and credits report doesn’t take corrections into account.
