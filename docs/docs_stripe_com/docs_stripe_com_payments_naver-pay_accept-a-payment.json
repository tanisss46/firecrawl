We\nrecommend that you configure your payment methods from the Stripe Dashboard\nusing the instructions in [Accept a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web&ui=stripe-hosted).\n\nIf you want to continue manually configuring the payment methods you present to\nyour customers with Checkout, use this guide. Otherwise, update your integration\nto [configure payment methods in the\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/dashboard-payment-methods).\n\nIntegrating with [Naver Pay](https://pay.naver.com/) enables South Korea-based\ncustomers to pay using this popular local payment method.\n\nWhen a customer makes a payment, we redirect them to our local processor partner\nto authenticate and authorize the payment. After the customer authorizes the\npayment, we redirect them back to your site.\n\nCustomers can optionally use their Naver Pay points to pay for their purchase.\n\n[Determine\ncompatibility](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/naver-pay/accept-a-payment#compatibility)\n[A Checkout\nSession](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/how-checkout-works) must\nsatisfy all of the following conditions to support South Korean payment methods:\n\n- [Prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices) for all line items must be\nexpressed in Korean won (currency code `krw`).\n- The minimum amount accepted is 100 KRW, and the maximum amount accepted is\n2,000,000 KRW.\n[Accept a Naver Pay\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/naver-pay/accept-a-payment#accept-a-naver-pay-payment)\nEnable Naver Pay by making the following updates to your integration.\n\nWhen creating a [Checkout\nSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions), you must do the\nfollowing:\n\n- Add `naver_pay` to the list of `payment_method_types`.\n- Make sure all `line_items` use the `krw` currency.\n\n```\nStripe::Checkout::Session.create({\n mode: 'payment',\n payment_method_types: ['card'],\n payment_method_types: ['card', 'naver_pay'],\n line_items: [{\n price_data: {\n currency: 'usd',\n # To accept `naver_pay`, all line items must have currency: krw\n currency: 'krw',\n product_data: {\n name: 'T-shirt',\n },\n unit_amount: 2000,\n },\n quantity: 1,\n }],\n success_url: 'https://example.com/success',\n cancel_url: 'https://example.com/cancel',\n})\n```\n\n[Test your\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/naver-pay/accept-a-payment#test-integration)\nWhile testing your Checkout integration, select **Naver Pay** and click **Pay**.\nThis redirects you to a Stripe-hosted page where you have the choice to\nauthorize or fail the payment. If you authorize the payment, the PaymentIntent\nswitches from `requires_action` to `succeeded`. Failing the test payment makes\nthe PaymentIntent switch from `requires_action` to `requires_payment_method`.\nLearn more about how to [test](https://docs.stripe.com/testing#redirects)\nredirect-based payment methods.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Accept a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web&ui=stripe-hosted)\n- [configure payment methods in the\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/dashboard-payment-methods)\n- [Naver Pay](https://pay.naver.com/)\n- [A Checkout\nSession](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/how-checkout-works)\n- [Prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices)\n- [Checkout Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions)\n- [https://example.com/success](https://example.com/success)\n- [https://example.com/cancel](https://example.com/cancel)\n- [test](https://docs.stripe.com/testing#redirects)",
