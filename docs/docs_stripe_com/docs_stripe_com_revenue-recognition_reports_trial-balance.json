Running a trial balance is an important step when book\nclosing because it helps summarize all the transactions for the period, showing\nthe balances in each account. It ensures that the total debits and credits are\nequal, which confirms that the books are balanced.\n\n![Trial\nbalance](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/trial-balance.7dcb7429b24b35ebc1d1300cb8b93d56.png)\n\n## Trial balance report\n\nThe trial balance report lets you review the starting balance, net change, and\nending balance for each account. In the report, positive numbers represent\ndebits, and negative numbers shown in parentheses `()` represent credits.\n\nColumns Description General ledger accountYour general ledger account if it’s\nmapped in Stripe using the [map to your chart of\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/chart-of-accounts)\nfeature, or default [Stripe\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/methodology)Starting\nbalanceBalance at the start of the selected accounting periodNet changeNet\nchange due to the activity in the selected accounting periodEnding\nbalanceBalance at the end of the selected accounting periodGL codeThe number\ncorresponding to the GL accounts\nThe Account Balance changes shown in the Trial Balance report will reconcile\nwith other Revenue Recognition reports like Income Statement, Balance sheet\nreport, Debits and Credits report for the same time period and currency.
