You can provide missing\ninformation by [updating the connected\naccount](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/accounts/overview) or [updating\nthe tax form](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/modify-tax-forms).\n\nForms with federal filing status or state filing status of `Will not file` are\nbelow either the IRS or State thresholds. When a form doesn’t meet the threshold\nset at the federal or state level it’s not filed with that respective tax\nauthority. You can file tax forms that are below the threshold or are incomplete\nby specifying [filing\nrequirements](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/modify-tax-forms?method=csv#tax-form-status)\nin a CSV import. You can also use filing requirements to omit a tax form from\nfiling.\n\n## “Ready” or “Needs Attention” forms that appear to be below threshold\n\nSome forms with totals that might seem below the [federal\nthreshold](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/tax-reporting#1099-nec) can also show\nup as `Ready` or `Needs Attention` for two reasons:\n\n- Grouped TIN\n- The state threshold is lower than the IRS threshold\n\n### Grouped TIN\n\nPer IRS regulations, when multiple forms share the same Tax Identification\nNumber (TIN), Stripe calculates each form’s filing eligibility based on the\naggregate total of all those forms. As a result, an individual form that appears\nto be below the IRS threshold can still require filing because the total amount\nof all forms sharing its TIN exceeds the threshold.\n\nWhen Stripe calculates the aggregate total of forms that share the same TIN, it\nincludes a maximum of 100 forms. If you have more than 100 forms that share the\nsame TIN, manually verify their filing eligibility.\n\nStripe files each form separately, regardless of whether it shares a TIN with\nother forms.\n\nIf an account is grouped, you will see this in the Dashboard:\n\n![Tooltip showing a message about aggregating forms that use the same\nTIN](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/tax-forms-tin-aggregation.071bd2d810202ff9fc51490a8e9cd95e.png)\n\nTo determine which forms share the same TIN, enter the ID of the form in the\n**Forms grouped with** filter and apply the filter.\n\n### The state threshold is lower than the IRS threshold\n\nAnother reason why a form might appear as `Ready` or `Needs attention` for the\nIRS is that the form needs to be filed to a state that is part of the Combined\nFederal and State Filing (CFSF) program. For CFSF states, forms filed to the IRS\nare automatically forwarded to the appropriate state, eliminating the need to\nfile separately to the state. Check the [1099 form requirements by\nstate](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/tax-forms-state-requirements#check-1099-form-requirements-by-state)\nsection to determine which states are part of the CFSF program and have lower\nstate filing thresholds than the IRS.\n\n## Confirm tax form settings\n\nConfirm the accuracy of your payer information and [tax form\nsettings](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/tax-form-settings) before filing.\nYou’ll reconfirm some tax form settings in the filing process, but you should\nalso confirm the tax form settings before filing.\n\n## File your tax forms\n\nWhen you’re ready to file, perform one final check of the forms that are in a\n`Ready` state. Clicking the **File** button automatically pulls forms in a\n`Ready` state (or `Ready!` If you applied filing requirements) into the filing\nprocess.\n\nIf needed, you can complete the filing process more than once and file forms in\nbatches as they become `Ready`. The forms for the IRS and the States will be\nfiled at the same time. Currently, there’s no option to file forms with the IRS\nand States separately.\n\n#### Caution\n\nIf you have forms in a `Needs Attention` state and want to file them as they\nare, you can override the form status by [explicitly updating the filing\nrequirement](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/modify-tax-forms?method=csv#tax-form-status).\n\nFrom the [Tax reporting](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/taxes/forms) view\nin the Dashboard, click the **File** button to begin the filing process.\n\nConfirm your payer information. To change any payer information, close the\nfiling process and go to your tax form settings. If you file forms with\nincorrect payer information, the IRS requires you to mail a letter with the\ncorrections.\n\n![Confirm payer\ninformation](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/file_confirm_payer_information_2022.19cfdfa5e374ca6b01578335169fd11a.png)\n\nNext, confirm the settings for specific tax form types. To change the settings,\nclose the filing process and go to your tax form settings.\n\n![Confirm settings for tax form\ntypes](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/file_confirm_filing_details_2022.df239dbc219060ae9b125c98c8da27ce.png)\n\nFinally, accept a standard IRS penalty of perjury statement. Click the **File\ntax forms** button to queue your tax forms for automatic filing with the IRS.\n\nIf you aren’t filing any 1099 tax form corrections, you can disregard delivery\npreferences for form corrections. Choose either **Mail** or **None** and proceed\nwith filing your forms. Tax forms will be delivered according to your [delivery\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/tax_forms).\n\n![Accept an IRS penalty of perjury\nstatement](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/review_and_file_corrections.ee91133e774d4310dcd1593071260f21.png)\n\nAccept an IRS penalty of perjury statement\n\nAfter you click **File tax forms**, a **Success** message displays.\n\n![Accept an IRS penalty of perjury\nstatement](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/file_success_2022.ff8bfe09b578986397dcd9b3a6cbd690.png)\n\n## After filing your 1099 tax forms\n\nAfter you submit your filing request, Stripe collects and transmits your forms\nto the IRS and applicable state reporting agencies, and delivers forms to your\nconnected accounts based on your delivery settings.\n\nIf you’ve enabled e-delivery, Stripe immediately emails your connected accounts\nso they can access forms in the Stripe Express Dashboard. For postal delivery,\nUSPS first class mail can take up to 10 business days.\n\nIf you need to file a form with both the IRS and the state, the form is sent\nonly one time to the connected account user. For more information, see [Deliver\ntax forms](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/deliver-tax-forms).\n\n## Understand tax form status\n\nTo help you determine if you need to take action on any forms, the status of\nfiled tax forms updates automatically.\n\n### Federal Filing Status:\n\nThe IRS typically responds to us within 5 business days. At that point, you can\nexpect to see the **Federal filing status** change from `Filed` to either\n`Accepted` or `Rejected`. Learn more about common [rejection\nreasons](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/correct-tax-forms#rejection-reasons).\n\n### State filing Status\n\nStates have varied timelines for submission results. In most cases, state\nfilings can take up to 14 days for the **State filing status** to move from\n`Filed` to either `Accepted` or `Rejected`. Learn more about common [rejection\nreasons](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/correct-tax-forms#rejection-reasons).\n\n#### Note\n\nThe `Rejected` status implies that the form was either rejected by the State\nafter submission, or that the State refused to accept the information during\nsubmission.\n\n### Delivery status\n\nFor electronic delivery, the delivery status changes to `Delivered` a few\nminutes after the email is delivered.\n\nFor postal mail, the delivery status changes to `Delivered` after Stripe’s\npostal delivery partner confirms that the mailing is delivered. That can take\nseveral days.\n\nA delivery status of `Failed` means that an issue prevented the mailing from\nbeing completed. This typically occurs when the mailing address on file contains\nerrors.\n\n## Links\n\n- [1099 tax forms](https://support.stripe.com/express/topics/1099-tax-forms)\n- [Will not\nfile](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-tax-reporting#understand-tax-form-status)\n- [updating the connected\naccount](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/accounts/overview)\n- [updating the tax form](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/modify-tax-forms)\n- [filing\nrequirements](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/modify-tax-forms?method=csv#tax-form-status)\n- [federal threshold](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/tax-reporting#1099-nec)\n- [1099 form requirements by\nstate](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/tax-forms-state-requirements#check-1099-form-requirements-by-state)\n- [tax form settings](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/tax-form-settings)\n- [Tax reporting](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/taxes/forms)\n- [delivery settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/tax_forms)\n- [Deliver tax forms](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/deliver-tax-forms)\n- [rejection\nreasons](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/correct-tax-forms#rejection-reasons)",
