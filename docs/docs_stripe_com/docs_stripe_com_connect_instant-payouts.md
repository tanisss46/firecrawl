# Instant Payouts for Connect

## Offer connected accounts immediate access to their funds with instant payouts.

Available in: 
With Instant Payouts, Connect platforms and marketplaces can allow their users
to access their balances immediately following a successful charge. Instant
Payouts are available at any day or time, including weekends and holidays, and
funds typically settle in the associated bank account within 30 minutes.

You can use Instant Payouts to:

- Attract and retain new users
- Realize additional revenue by [assessing a
fee](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/instant-payouts#monetization-and-fees)

Funds acquired from card payments are available for Instant Payouts as soon as
the charge is complete. ACH or bank debits are only available for Instant
Payouts after the payment has settled.

## Eligible connected accounts

Instant Payouts are only available for connected accounts that are in the same
country as the platform and must use the local currency.

### External Account eligibility

To receive Instant Payouts, a user must have an eligible external account. An
external account in the context of Stripe Connect refers to a bank account or
debit card associated with a connected account, and eligiblity varies by
country.

If you’re responsible for connected accounts (including Custom and Express
accounts), that might not be able to refund negative balances, enable
Stripe-hosted onboarding and dashboard interfaces to collect debit card details.
To enable this, navigate to your [External Account
settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/payouts/external_accounts),
and under **Allow debit cards?**, select **Yes**.

You can verify Instant Payout eligibility for your user by calling the [External
Accounts API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/external_account_bank_accounts/list)
with the Connected Account ID. The response returns the account’s 10 most
recently active External Accounts, and those with `instant` in the
`available_payout_methods` parameter are eligible for Instant Payouts. You can
paginate through the results if you need to review more than the default display
of 10.

 "object": "list",
 "data": [
 {
 "object": "bank_account",
 "available_payout_methods": [
 "standard",
 "instant"
 ],
 ...
 }
 ],
}
```

### Invite users to add eligible accounts

If your user doesn’t have an External Account eligible for Instant Payouts, you
can prompt them to add an eligible account through the [Account
API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/update#update_account-external_account).

```
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts/{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}} \
 -u "sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:" \
 -d external_account={{BANK_ACCOUNT_TOKEN_ID}}
```

## Monetization and fees

Some marketplaces and platforms choose to monetize Instant Payouts, offering the
convenience for a fee. If you monetize Instant Payouts, Stripe supports two
methods of fee collection: Application Fees and account debits

### Application Fees

With [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees), Stripe
collects the fee you determine and initiates the Instant Payout synchronously.
Stripe recommends applying an application fee because it’s a single, seamless
transaction:

- Users can’t pay out more than their available balance
- Fees can be refunded through the API or the Dashboard
- Monetization options include fixed or variable fees with minimums and maximums
- Fees are paired to your Instant Payouts revenue with the [Payout
Object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payouts/object), helping with reporting and
reconciliation. You can view your collected fees in the [Payments
tab](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/application_fees) on the Dashboard

To use Application Fees, set your pricing structure using the
[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/payouts/instant-payouts).

#### Caution

Application Fees for Instant Payouts rely on the [Balance API
net-of-fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/balance/balance_object#balance_object-instant_available-net_available)
field. Turning this on without using the new field could break your API
integration.

### Account Debits

You can [directly debit](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-debits) your
connected account’s Stripe balance and credit your platform account’s Stripe
balance to collect fees. After the Instant Payout, call the [Charge
API](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_charge), specifying the connected
account ID as the `source` parameter. Consider the following limitations when
using account debits to collect Instant Payout fees:

- You must get legally binding consent from your connected accounts.
- Account debits carry an [additional cost](https://stripe.com/connect/pricing).
- Debiting an account can’t make the connected account balance become negative
unless you have [reserves
enabled](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-balances#understanding-connected-reserve-balances)
(on by default for all new platforms created after January 31, 2017) and have a
bank account in the same currency as the debit.
- If the connected account has already paid out their available balance in full,
you might be delayed in collecting the fee.
- Reconciliation requires maintaining an internal database of debits and related
payouts.

## Initiate an Instant Payout

You can initiate Instant Payouts either manually on your users’ behalf or you
can use the Stripe APIs to compose user interfaces to allow your users to
initiate an Instant Payout. In circumstances where you initiate Instant Payouts
on your users’ behalf, you may only do so in accordance with instructions and
authorizations given by your users.

APIEmbedded ComponentsDashboard- Call [retrieve
balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/balance/balance_retrieve), expanding
[instant_available-net_available](https://docs.stripe.com/api/balance/balance_object#balance_object-instant_available-net_available).

The property `instant_available.net_available` is the connected account’s
instant balance net of platform fees for each instantly available destination.
You must use this field if you’re monetizing with [Application
Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/instant-payouts#application-fees). This
amount is calculated from the platform’s Application Fee pricing structure set
in the Dashboard.

The property `instant_available.amount` is the connected account’s gross
balance, not including any platform fees.

The following example shows a platform setting 2% pricing for any USD Instant
Payout:

```
curl -G https://api.stripe.com/v1/balance \
 -u "sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:" \
 -H "Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}" \
 -d "expand[]"="instant_available.net_available"
```

```
{
 "object": "balance",
 "available": [
 {
 "amount": 500,
 "currency": "usd",
 "source_types": {
 "card": 500
 }
 }
 ],
 "instant_available": [
 {
 "amount": 500,
 "currency": "usd",
 "net_available": [
 {
 "amount": 490,
 "destination": "ba_abc123",
 "source_types": {
 "card": 490
 }
 }
 ],
 "source_types": {
 "card": 500
 }
 }
 ],
 ...
}
```

#### Note

Funds from card charges are available immediately, but funds from bank debits
(such as ACH) aren’t available immediately.

Key considerations:

- `net_available` only appears when included as an [expanded
parameter](https://docs.stripe.com/expand).
- `net_available` only appears for connected accounts. You’ll receive an error
expanding this for your platform.
- A hash in `net_available` only appears for instantly-available external
accounts. External accounts that aren’t valid instant payouts destinations won’t
appear.
- External accounts can have different `net_available` balances based on
external account properties and platform-set pricing rules.
- Call [create payout](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payouts/create) with
`method=instant`. Use the amount field corresponding with your monetization
strategy, either `instant_available.amount` or
`instant_available.net_available[0].amount`. Use the `destination` from the
balance endpoint to pay out to an intended external account.

```
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payouts \
 -u "sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:" \
 -H "Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}" \
 -d amount=490 \
 -d currency=usd \
 -d method=instant \
 -d destination={{BANK_ACCOUNT_TOKEN_ID}}
```

#### Caution

Instant payouts to ineligible external accounts will fail, so [confirm
eligibility](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/instant-payouts#external-account-eligibility)
before surfacing the capability to your connected accounts.

- View your [application
fee](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fee/retrieve) that was created by
the payout.

```
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/application_fees/{{APPLICATION_FEE_ID}} \
 -u "sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:"
```

## Eligibility and daily volume limits

Your account has a maximum amount it can pay out instantly per day across all
connected accounts. Your users can’t initiate Instant Payouts after you reach
your daily limit. Daily limits reset at midnight US Central Time (CT).

## Pricing

Irrespective of your monetization decisions, Stripe charges marketplaces and
platforms a 1% fee for all Instant Payouts. Each Instant Payout transaction has
a minimum and maximum amount dependent on the currency. These fees are assessed
as part of your overall Connect fees.

## Manage risk and eligibility

When platforms and marketplaces are liable for losses, you’re liable for
uncovered negative balances due to refunds or disputes.

Stripe recommends setting risk parameters to protect your platform from
unintended losses. We provide a number of [best practices for managing fraud and
risk](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/risk-management/best-practices#fraud),
such as setting trust thresholds like the following:

- Minimum processing volume
- Days active
- Chargeback rate

## Marketing

Your marketing of Instant Payouts to Connected Accounts must clearly and
conspicuously disclose any fees you intend to apply for Instant Payouts.

Make sure your marketing is consistent with Stripe’s marketing of the product,
which states that: “You can request Instant Payouts 24/7, including weekends and
holidays, and funds typically appear in the associated bank account within 30
minutes”. Some Instant Payouts might not settle within 30 minutes, and instead
might take longer to be credited to the relevant bank account.
