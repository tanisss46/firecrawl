# Connect platforms can identify reused card or bank accounts across connected accounts as they now will share the same fingerprintBreaking changes

## What’s new

When viewed by a platform, cards and bank accounts created on behalf of
connected accounts now have a fingerprint that’s universal across all connected
accounts. For accounts that aren’t connect platforms, there is no change.

## Impact

This change provides platform users with a consistent fingerprint for cards and
bank accounts across all connected accounts. It allows platforms to more easily
identify and track unique payment methods across their entire ecosystem of
connected accounts.
