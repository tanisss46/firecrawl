  "content": "# Standalone Tax Connector for Adobe CommercePublic preview\n\n## Automate tax collection and reporting on Adobe Commerce with non-Stripe payment solutions.\n\n#### Public preview\n\nThe standalone Stripe Tax connector for Adobe Commerce is currently available as\na public preview and works with any payments provider. Please [Reach out to\nus](mailto:adobe-commerce-stripe-tax-rc@stripe.com) if you’re interested in\njoining the beta.\n\nUse the Stripe Tax module for Adobe Commerce to calculate, collect, and report\ntaxes on payments made through any supported Adobe Commerce payment method.\n\nCompared to the native Adobe Commerce tax engine, Stripe Tax provides a simpler\nconfiguration and activation process. Because Stripe Tax is dynamic, you don’t\nneed to reconfigure Adobe Commerce when tax rates change for specific product\ntypes, locations, or time periods. Stripe continuously updates your local tax\nrules and automatically calculates the correct tax amount.\n\n## Availability\n\nTo use Stripe Tax with Adobe Commerce, your business must be based in one of the\n[supported countries](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries).\n\nMinimum system requirements include PHP 7.4, and at least version 2.3.7 or later\nof Magento 2 and Adobe Commerce.\n\n[Contact support](https://support.stripe.com/contact/) for questions related to\nsetting up Stripe Tax for Adobe Commerce.\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install Stripe Tax for Adobe Commerce:\n\n- Place an order for the module through the [Adobe\nMarketplace](https://commercemarketplace.adobe.com/stripe-tax.html).\n- Open your terminal and run the following command in your Adobe Commerce\ndirectory:\n\n```\ncomposer require stripe/tax\n```\n\n- If this is your first time installing a module, you might be prompted to\nsubmit your username and password.

This enables\nthe module to start calculating, collecting, and reporting taxes.\n- **Mode**: Select **Test** to use test credentials for testing the integration\nwithout affecting real transactions. Switch to **Live** when you’re ready to\ncalculate taxes in a production environment.\n- **Publishable API key**: Enter your publishable API key obtained from your\n[Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys).\n- **Secret API key**: Enter your secret API key from your [Stripe\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys).\n- **Product prices and promotions**: Configure how to calculate product price\ntaxes and discount amount taxes. Set this to either `Tax exclusive` or `Tax\ninclusive` depending on your store’s pricing strategy. If you select **Tax\nexclusive**, product prices configured from the admin panel, or discounts\napplied on the cart don’t include tax. If you select **Tax inclusive**, the\nproduct prices and discounts already include tax.\n- **Shipping is**: Determine how shipping is taxed. Select either **Tax free**,\n**Tax exclusive**, or **Tax inclusive** based on whether and how you want\nshipping costs to include tax.\n\n### Product tax classes\n\nYou can manage product tax classes to make sure that your products are\ncategorized correctly for tax calculation purposes.\n\nTo add, edit, or remove product tax classes in your Adobe Commerce store:\n\n- From the admin panel, navigate to **Stores** > **Taxes** > **Stripe Tax\nClasses** to open the Stripe Tax Classes page where you can manage your tax\nclasses.\n- To add a new tax class, click **Add a new tax class** at the bottom of the\nStripe Tax Classes page. This opens a modal where you can select a tax category.\nEach category represents a specific product tax code. Select the one you want to\nuse for your products, then click **Add**.\n- You can edit an existing Tax Class if your products are already assigned to\ntax classes from before you installed Stripe Tax. This allows you to keep those\nexisting tax classes, and assign a product tax code to them. To do so, click\n**Select** in the **Actions** column next to the tax class you want to edit.\nChoose **Set category** to assign a new category to the tax class.\n- To rename a tax class, click its name. This opens a modal where you can set a\nnew tax class name. Alternatively, you can expand the **Select** options list\nfrom the **Actions** column and click **Rename** or **Delete**.\n- Changes to the tax classes aren’t saved automatically. To save your changes,\nclick **Save Changes**.\n- After you configure your tax classes, you can use them to apply tax classes on\nproducts:\n- From any product edit page, you can configure the product’s tax class using\nthe **Tax Class** dropdown. The tax classes you’ve added appear on the product\nedit page.\n- Alternatively, you can use the Tax configuration page to set the default tax\nclasses for products when they haven’t been assigned a tax class, or when their\ntax class has been deleted.\n\n### Tax registrations\n\nBefore you can perform live tax calculations, you need to add tax registrations\nin your Stripe Dashboard. You can add tax registrations manually in the [Tax\nregistrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/tax/registrations) section, or\nthrough the [Tax thresholds](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/tax/thresholds)\nsection. During the tax registration steps, you can choose between immediate\nregistration, or schedule the registration to begin at a date in the future if\nyou’re planning to register. Stripe Tax only calculates and collects tax on\ntransactions in these locations.\n\nIf you start selling to a new country or tax jurisdiction, Stripe can\nautomatically let you know if you need to register for tax in that jurisdiction.\nThis typically happens when your sales volume exceeds the tax threshold of that\ntax authority. If you have existing transactions on Stripe, you can use our\n[monitoring tool](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/thresholds) to understand\nwhere you might need to register.\n\n## Refunds and tax reversals\n\nA tax reversal is triggered when you create a credit memo from the admin area of\nAdobe Commerce. The tax reversal will be triggered in both cases of creating an\nOnline credit memo or an Offline credit memo.\n\n- **Refund Offline**: This creates a tax reversal without refunding the payment.\n- **Refund**: This creates a tax reversal and refunds the payment online via\nStripe.\n\nIn cases where the credit memo does not include all of the order items (partial\ncredit memos), then the tax reversal will be triggered only for the items on the\npartial credit memo.\n\n#### Caution\n\nPlease be advised that the credit memo’s “Adjustment Fee” and “Adjustment\nRefund” fields are never taken into consideration during tax reversals.\n\n## Export tax transactions\n\nIf you are in a country where automatic tax reporting is not yet supported, you\ncan export your tax transactions from [Tax\nregistrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations)\n\n- Click on the country for which you’d like to export tax transactions.\n- Click the “Export transactions” button at the top right of the registration\npage.\n- Select the date range and columns you’d like to export.\n- Click the “Export” button to download the transactions in CSV format.\n\n## Links\n\n- [supported countries](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries)\n- [Contact support](https://support.stripe.com/contact/)\n- [API\nfees](https://support.stripe.com/questions/understanding-stripe-tax-pricing)\n- [Adobe Marketplace](https://commercemarketplace.adobe.com/stripe-tax.html)\n- [Adobe Commerce authentication\nkeys](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/install-gde/prereq/connect-auth.html)\n- [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys)\n- [Tax registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/tax/registrations)\n- [Tax thresholds](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/tax/thresholds)\n- [monitoring tool](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/thresholds)\n- [Tax registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations)",
