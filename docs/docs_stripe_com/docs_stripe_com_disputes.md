# Disputes and fraud

## Learn about disputes, how they work, and what you can do to prevent them.

A dispute (also known as a chargeback) occurs when a cardholder questions your
payment with their card issuer.

To process a chargeback, the issuer creates a formal dispute on the card
network, which immediately reverses the payment, pulling the money for the
payment—as well as one or more network dispute fees—from Stripe. After that,
Stripe debits your balance for the payment amount and dispute fee.

To help our users submit the best possible response for each dispute, Stripe
provides a guided process within the
[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/disputes). This allows you to
provide all of the necessary text and images that are appropriate to the
[dispute reason](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/categories) and your counter
argument.
