Join [Stripe\nInsiders](https://insiders.stripe.dev/c/sandboxes/6), our new early access\nprogram, to register your interest in joining the Sandboxes preview.\n\nWhen creating a sandbox, you must choose your starting configuration.\n\nTo copy settings and capabilities from your existing account, click **Create\nsandbox** > **Preconfigured**. Stripe provides placeholder business data to help\nyou start testing most Stripe features. This sandbox includes placeholder data\nin the same country as your existing account.\n\nTo create a blank sandbox where nothing is copied from your existing account,\nclick **Create sandbox** > **Blank configuration**.\n\nStarting with the same settings and capabilities as your existing account\neliminates the need to spend time manually verifying that your sandboxes behave\nlike your existing account. We don’t synchronize settings and capabilities. As a\nresult, they can diverge from live settings and capabilities at any time. This\nallows for testing how settings and capabilities changes affect integration\nbehavior. See the\n[settings](https://docs.stripe.com/sandboxes/dashboard/sandbox-settings#payment-settings)\nand\n[capabilities](https://docs.stripe.com/sandboxes/dashboard/sandbox-settings#account-capabilities)\ncopied when you choose the **Preconfigured** option.\n\n### Create a sandbox with a country different from your live account\n\nTo create a sandbox with a country different from your live account, choose the\n**Blank** configuration.
