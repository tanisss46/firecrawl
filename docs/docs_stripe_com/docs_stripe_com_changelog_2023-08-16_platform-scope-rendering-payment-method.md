# Platform-scope rendering for select PaymentMethod fingerprintsBreaking changes

## What’s new

When being viewed by a platform, PaymentMethod fingerprints of types
`us_bank_account`, `acss_debit`, `sepa_debit`, `bacs_debit`, and `au_becs_debit`
are rendered in platform scope, not the owning merchant (connected account)
scope. This works similarly to the
[2018-01-23](https://docs.stripe.com/changelog/2023-08-16/platform-scope-rendering-payment-method#2018-01-23)
change for cards and bank accounts.

## Impact

PaymentMethod fingerprints for bank account-based payment types are now rendered
in platform scope when viewed by a platform, aligning with the previous changes
for cards and bank accounts.
