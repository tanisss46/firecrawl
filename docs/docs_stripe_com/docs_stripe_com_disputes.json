  "content": "# Disputes and fraud\n\n## Learn about disputes, how they work, and what you can do to prevent them.\n\nA dispute (also known as a chargeback) occurs when a cardholder questions your\npayment with their card issuer.\n\nTo process a chargeback, the issuer creates a formal dispute on the card\nnetwork, which immediately reverses the payment, pulling the money for the\npayment—as well as one or more network dispute fees—from Stripe. After that,\nStripe debits your balance for the payment amount and dispute fee.\n\nTo help our users submit the best possible response for each dispute, Stripe\nprovides a guided process within the\n[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/disputes). This allows you to\nprovide all of the necessary text and images that are appropriate to the\n[dispute reason](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/categories) and your counter\nargument.\n\n## Manage and prevent disputes\n\n[How disputes workLearn the terminology and lifecycle of\ndisputes.](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/how-disputes-work)[Respond to\ndisputesRespond to disputes using best\npractices.](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/responding)[Dispute\nwithdrawalsProvide the appropriate evidence when disputes are\nwithdrawn.](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/withdrawing)[Measuring disputesSee\nhow excessive disputes could impact your\nbusiness.](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/measuring)\nIf you need help with a dispute, [contact\nsupport](https://support.stripe.com/contact).\n\n## Additional resources\n\n[Disputes on Connect platformsLearn about the dispute responsibilities on\nConnect platforms.](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/connect)[Monitoring\nprogramsLearn about the monitoring programs that card networks\noperate.](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/monitoring-programs)[High risk\nmerchant listsLearn the criteria for inclusion in MATCH and VMSS\nlists.](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/match)[Browse Fraud Stripe AppsLearn\nabout Fraud apps in the App\nMarketplace.](https://marketplace.stripe.com/categories/fraud)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/disputes)\n- [dispute reason](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/categories)\n- [How disputes workLearn the terminology and lifecycle of\ndisputes.](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/how-disputes-work)\n- [Respond to disputesRespond to disputes using best\npractices.](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/responding)\n- [Dispute withdrawalsProvide the appropriate evidence when disputes are\nwithdrawn.](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/withdrawing)\n- [Measuring disputesSee how excessive disputes could impact your\nbusiness.](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/measuring)\n- [contact support](https://support.stripe.com/contact)\n- [Disputes on Connect platformsLearn about the dispute responsibilities on\nConnect platforms.](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/connect)\n- [Monitoring programsLearn about the monitoring programs that card networks\noperate.](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/monitoring-programs)\n- [High risk merchant listsLearn the criteria for inclusion in MATCH and VMSS\nlists.](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/match)\n- [Browse Fraud Stripe AppsLearn about Fraud apps in the App\nMarketplace.](https://marketplace.stripe.com/categories/fraud)",
