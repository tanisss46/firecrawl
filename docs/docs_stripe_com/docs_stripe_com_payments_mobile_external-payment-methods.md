# Add external payment methods

## Add external payment methods to the Mobile Payment Element.

The [Mobile Payment
Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements/mobile-payment-element) can
display external payment methods that you support in addition to the payment
methods processed through Stripe. Integrating external payment methods requires
additional integration work, because external payment method transactions are
processed and finalized outside of Stripe.

#### External payment methods responsibility

When customers choose an external payment method, your app handles the payment
instead of Stripe processing it. To learn about your responsibilities and the
ongoing availability of external payment methods, see the [external payment
methods
disclaimer](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/mobile/external-payment-methods#external-payment-methods-disclaimer).
