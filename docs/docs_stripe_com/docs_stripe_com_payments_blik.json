  "content": "# BLIK payments\n\n## Learn about BLIK, a common payment method in Poland.\n\nBLIK is a [single use](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#usage)\npayment method that requires customers to\n[authenticate](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#customer-actions)\ntheir payments. When customers want to pay online using BLIK, they request a\nsix-digit code from their banking application and enter it into the payment\ncollection form.\n\nThe bank sends a push notification to your customer’s mobile phone asking to\nauthorize the payment inside their banking application. The BLIK code is valid\nfor 2 minutes; customers have 60 seconds to authorize the payment after starting\na payment. After 60 seconds, it times out and they must request a new BLIK code.\nCustomers typically approve BLIK payments in less than 10 seconds.\n\nPayment method propertiesBusiness locationsProduct support- **Customer\nlocations**\n\nPoland\n- **Presentment currency**\n\nPLN\n- **Payment confirmation**\n\nCustomer-initiated\n- **Payment method family**\n\nAuthenticated bank debit\n- **Recurring payments**\n\nNo\n- **Payout timing**\n\nStandard payout timing applies\n- **Connect support**\n\n[Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/blik#connect)\n- **Dispute support**\n\n[Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/blik#disputed-payments)\n- **Manual capture support**\n\nNo\n- **Refunds / Partial refunds**\n\n[Yes / Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/blik#refunds)\n\n## Payment flow\n\n!\n\nCustomer selects BLIK at checkout.\n\n!\n\nCustomer is directed to their mobile banking app to generate a 6-digit code.\n\n!\n\nCustomer puts the code into the checkout.\n\n!\n\nCustomer is notified that payment is complete.\n\n## Get started\n\nYou don’t have to integrate BLIK and other payment methods individually. If you\nuse our front-end products, Stripe automatically determines the most relevant\npayment methods to display. Go to the [Stripe\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and enable\nBLIK. To get started with one of our hosted UIs, follow a quickstart:\n\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart): Our prebuilt, hosted\ncheckout page.\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart): Our drop-in UI\ncomponents.\n\nIf you prefer to manually list payment methods, learn how to [manually configure\nBLIK as a payment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/blik/accept-a-payment).\n\n## Disputes\n\nBLIK has a claims process that allows transaction disputes. Customers can open\ndisputes for cases of suspected fraud, double payments, or a difference between\nan order and a transaction amount.\n\nAfter the customer initiates a dispute, Stripe notifies you using:\n\n- Email\n- The Stripe Dashboard\n- An API `charge.dispute.created` event (if your integration is set up to\nreceive [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks))\n\nStripe holds back the disputed amount from your balance until BLIK resolves the\ndispute.\n\nWe request that you upload compelling evidence proving that you fulfilled the\npurchase order [using the Stripe\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/responding#respond). This evidence\ncan include the:\n\n- Tracking ID\n- Shipping date\n- Record of purchase for intangible goods, such as IP address or email receipt\n- Record of purchase for services or physical goods, such as phone number or\nproof of receipt\n- Record of refund (for purchase you have already refunded)\n\nTo handle disputes programmatically, [respond to disputes using the\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/api).\n\nThis information helps BLIK determine if a dispute is valid. Make sure the\nevidence you provide contains as much detail as possible from what the customer\nprovided at checkout. You must submit the requested information within 12\ncalendar days. If BLIK resolves the dispute with you winning, we return the\ndisputed amount to your Stripe balance. If BLIK rules in favor of the customer,\nthe balance charge becomes permanent.\n\n## Refunds\n\nBLIK supports full and partial refunds. Depending on the bank, refunds are\nprocessed immediately or within a couple of hours.\n\n## Connect\n\nIf you use [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect), you must consider the\nfollowing before you enable and use BLIK.\n\n### Request BLIK capabilities for your connected accounts\n\nSet the `blik_payments` capability to `active` on your platform account, and on\nany connected accounts you want to enable BLIK for. You can also [request more\naccount\ncapabilities](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities#requesting-unrequesting).\n\n### Merchant of record and statement descriptors\n\nThe [charge type](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges) of Connect payments\nmight change the default statement descriptor and the merchant name that appears\non the customer’s banking application and confirmation emails.\n\nCharge typeDescriptor taken fromDirectConnected\nAccountDestinationPlatformSeparate charge and transferPlatformDestination (with\n`on_behalf_of`)Connected AccountSeparate charge and transfer (with\n`on_behalf_of`)Connected Account\n\n## Links\n\n- [single use](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#usage)\n-\n[authenticate](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#customer-actions)\n- [Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/blik#connect)\n- [Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/blik#disputed-payments)\n- [Yes / Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/blik#refunds)\n- [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods)\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart)\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart)\n- [manually configure BLIK as a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/blik/accept-a-payment)\n- [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks)\n- [using the Stripe\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/responding#respond)\n- [respond to disputes using the API](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/api)\n- [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)\n- [request more account\ncapabilities](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities#requesting-unrequesting)\n- [charge type](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges)",
