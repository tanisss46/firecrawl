This method is fully PCI-DSS compliant, and we\nrecommend it for most Issuing users. Stripe offers Issuing Elements as a part of\n[Stripe.js](https://docs.stripe.com/js).\n\n## Retrieve virtual card details\n\nFor PCI-DSS compliance, we recommend limiting retrieval of virtual card\ninformation to the Dashboard or Issuing Elements. If you use the API to retrieve\ncard information, or if you export virtual card information from the Dashboard,\nstore it in a password manager or otherwise encrypt it.\n\nYou can retrieve both the full unredacted card number and CVC from the API. For\nsecurity reasons, you can only use these fields with virtual cards in live mode,\nand we omit them unless you explicitly request them with the\n[expand](https://docs.stripe.com/api/expanding_objects) property. You can only\nretrieve these fields for physical cards in [test\nmode](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes). Additionally, you can only\naccess them through the [Retrieve a\ncard](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/retrieve) endpoint.\n\n```\ncurl -G https://api.stripe.com/v1/issuing/cards \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d \"expand[]\"=number \\\n -d \"expand[]\"=cvc\n```\n\n## Details about PCI-DSS\n\nIf you are generating virtual cards for your own use, you are not required to\nattain PCI-DSS compliance for Issuing activity. If you are generating virtual\ncards for use by your users, you may be considered a Service Provider under\nPCI-DSS rules. Service Providers must be PCI-DSS compliant.\n\nIf you accept payments through Stripe, read more about your [PCI-DSS\nobligations](https://stripe.com/guides/pci-compliance). These obligations are in\naddition to requirements noted above.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Issuing Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/elements)\n- [PCI-DSS](https://stripe.com/guides/pci-compliance)\n- [Stripe.js](https://docs.stripe.com/js)\n- [expand](https://docs.stripe.com/api/expanding_objects)\n- [test mode](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes)\n- [Retrieve a card](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/retrieve)",
