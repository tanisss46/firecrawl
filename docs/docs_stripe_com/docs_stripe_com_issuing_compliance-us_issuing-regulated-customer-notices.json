  "content": "# Issuing regulated customer notices\n\n## Learn about sending regulatory notifications to your customers.\n\nTo comply with applicable laws, Issuing platforms must send customer\ncommunications upon certain trigger events. This guide shows you how Stripe\nhelps you stay compliant by sending properly formatted notices when required.\n\nStripe offers a no-code solution to [send regulated emails on your\nbehalf](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/emails). We recommend this\noption because it helps you stay compliant automatically.\n\nLet Stripe send regulated emails on your behalfSend regulated emails yourself\nStripe monitors [events requiring a customer\nnotice](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/compliance-us/issuing-regulated-customer-notices#notice-events),\nand sends an email on your behalf to the connected account.\n\n[Preview and send test\nemails](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/compliance-us/issuing-regulated-customer-notices#preview-and-send-test-emails)\nYou can preview our email templates and send test emails to make sure your\nbranding and email addresses are working as expected.\n\nFrom [Emails](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/emails), click\n**Preview and customize** to view the Issuing notice email templates, then click\n**Send test email**. Issuing notices only appear on this page for US Issuing\nplatforms.\n\n[Confirm your branding\nsettings](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/compliance-us/issuing-regulated-customer-notices#confirm-branding-settings)\nAll connected accounts that receive Issuing notices see your business name,\nicon, and branding colors in the notice emails. To manage these brand settings,\ngo to your [Emails](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/emails), click\n**Customize branding**, and verify the information is correct.\n\n[Confirm your support email and set up your email\ndomain](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/compliance-us/issuing-regulated-customer-notices#confirm-support-email-and-set-up-email-domain)\nWhen Stripe sends an email on your behalf, we use your support email for the\n**reply-to** address. You can configure this in your [Public details\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public).\n\nBy default, Stripe sends Issuing notices from\n**card-issuing-notices@stripe.com**, using your [business\nname](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect#branding) as the display\nname (for example, **“Rocket Rides”** card-issuing-notices@stripe.com). You can\nsend emails from [your own email\ndomain](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/email-domain), but you can’t\nchange the local address (for example,\ncard-issuing-notices@yourcustomdomain.com).\n\n[Review connected account\ndetails](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/compliance-us/issuing-regulated-customer-notices#review-connected-account-details)\nStripe sends notices to the connected account’s email saved with Stripe. If the\nconnected account has a primary user with log-in access to the Stripe Dashboard,\nwe’ll email that individual. If not, we send it to the [account email\naddress](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-email) (if\navailable) and if that’s not available, we send it to the [representative’s\nemail address](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/object#person_object-email).\n\nTo view notices sent by Stripe to a connected account, go to the account’s\nActivity page in your Dashboard and look for the section **Emails to this\naccount**.\n\n## Events that require a customer notice\n\nThe trigger events outlined below require a customer notice.\n\nEvents monitored by StripeOther events (not monitored by Stripe)\nStripe monitors for most events requiring a notice. If you aren’t a platform\nsending your own notices, we send a notice to the customer on your behalf.\n\n### Disputes\n\nYou must send regulated notices when you [submit a\ndispute](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/purchases/disputes), and again when the\nresult of the dispute is determined by the network (the dispute is either won or\nlost).\n\n### Involuntary account closures\n\nOnly Stripe can disable [inactive connected\naccounts](https://support.stripe.com/questions/issuing-managing-inactive-connect-accounts)\nand disable accounts that violate our [terms of\nservice](https://stripe.com/legal/restricted-businesses). Stripe sends emails on\nyour behalf for both of these events. If you’re sending emails yourself, Stripe\ninforms you of both events. We recommend that you send a notice for inactivity\nclosures, and we require that you send a notice for terms of service closures.\n\nIf the customer requests an account closure, you don’t need to send a notice\n(and Stripe won’t send one on your behalf).\n\n### Issuing applications rejected for failure to verify identity\n\nYou must notify a connected account when it [remains unverified within 29 days\nof completing an application for the card_issuing\ncapability](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/connect#failure-to-verify-rejection).\nStripe monitors completed applications (once the account has submitted all\nrequired information for Issuing and accepted the Issuing terms of service) and\ngenerates a notice if the capability remains `inactive` after 29 days. In test\nmode, Stripe generates the notice 1 hour after completion to help you reproduce\nthis scenario.\n\n### Charge Card credit underwriting decisions\n\nStripe monitors Charge Card underwriting decisions, and you must send regulated\nnotices for any negative impact to the user’s credit account. This includes\nrejected applications, rejected requests for a credit limit increase, reductions\nin a credit limit, or the closure of a credit line. If your platform hasn’t been\napproved to use Stripe’s Charge Card product, these templates don’t apply.\n\n## Issuing Notice email templates\n\nStripe uses the templates below to send emails to your users relevant to events\nthat trigger them. You can preview each template from [Communication\nSettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/emails) by clicking\n**Preview and customize**. Customize your platform name and logo by clicking\n**Customize branding**.\n\nIf you’ve configured your [custom email\ndomain](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/email-domain), Stripe\nautomatically removes the *italicized* text in each template. This text is\nincluded when the email is sent from card-issuing-notices@stripe.com.\n\n### Dispute submitted\n\n### Dispute lost\n\n### Dispute won\n\n### Account closed by Stripe for Inactivity\n\n### Account closed by Stripe for not providing business model clarification\n\n### Account closed by Stripe for not providing url clarification\n\n### Account closed by Stripe for not providing use case clarification\n\n### Account closed by Stripe for Terms of Service violation\n\n### Spend Card application rejected for failure to verify identity\n\n### Additional templates for Charge Card platforms\n\n### Equal Credit Opportunity Act disclosures\n\nIn the templates above, <Bank specific ECOA footer> is replaced with the\nappropriate equal credit opportunity act disclosure for your platform’s bank\nsponsor.\n\nCeltic BankCross River Bank\nOn behalf of Celtic Bank\n\nNotice: The federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act prohibits creditors from\ndiscriminating against credit applicants on the basis of race, color, religion,\nnational origin, sex, marital status, age (provided the applicant has the\ncapacity to enter into a binding contract); because all or part of the\napplicant’s income derives from any public assistance program; or because the\napplicant has in good faith exercised any right under the Consumer Credit\nProtection Act.\n\nThe Federal agency that administers compliance with this law concerning Celtic\nBank is Division of Depositor and Consumer Protection, National Center for\nConsumer and Depositor Assistance, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 1100\nWalnut Street, Box #11, Kansas City, MO 64106\n\n<Your platform name> is located at <[Your platform\naddress](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/account)>\n\nIf an account has cards provided by multiple banks (not common), then account\nclosure templates will show the <Bank specific ECOA footer> for all applicable\nbank sponsors.\n\n## Links\n\n- [send regulated emails on your\nbehalf](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/emails)\n- [Public details settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public)\n- [business name](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect#branding)\n- [your own email\ndomain](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/email-domain)\n- [account email\naddress](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-email)\n- [representative’s email\naddress](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/object#person_object-email)\n- [submit a dispute](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/purchases/disputes)\n- [inactive connected\naccounts](https://support.stripe.com/questions/issuing-managing-inactive-connect-accounts)\n- [terms of service](https://stripe.com/legal/restricted-businesses)\n- [remains unverified within 29 days of completing an application for the\ncard_issuing\ncapability](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/connect#failure-to-verify-rejection)\n- [Your platform address](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/account)",
