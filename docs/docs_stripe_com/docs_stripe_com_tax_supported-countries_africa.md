## When and how to register for tax collection

Different rules determine when and how you need to register to collect tax
depending on the country. Click the links above to learn about the thresholds
for tax collection in each location.

See [Thresholds](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/thresholds) to get insights
about your potential tax registration obligations in each location. Stripe only
monitors if you have reached a tax threshold for sales outside of the country
your business is based in. Stripe also notifies you with email and Dashboard
alerts when you need to register to collect tax. Learn more about how the
[monitoring tool works](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/monitoring).

In this region, your business needs to be a remote seller with no physical
presence (such as a shop or warehouse) to collect tax on Stripe.

After you’ve registered with a country, go to
[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations) to add your
registrations to Stripe in the Dashboard to start collecting tax on your
transactions in that location.

## How we calculate taxes

Stripe can calculate tax for [any of the product tax codes you assign to your
products](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes) in South Africa. For all the
other countries listed in this region, Stripe only supports calculation for
[digital products](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes?type=digital) sold by
remote sellers.

### Domestic transactions

A transaction where your business and your customer are in the same country is
called a domestic transaction. Stripe doesn’t yet support calculation on
domestic transactions in this region.

### Cross border transactions

A cross-border transaction is where your customer is located in a different
country to your business or when goods are shipped from one country to another.

Stripe calculates tax on a cross-border transaction taking into account the
following factors:

- the location of your business
- the tax registrations you’ve added to Stripe
- the location of the buyer
- the type of the product sold (based on which [product tax
code](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes) you assigned to your product)
- the status of the customer (whether they’re an individual or a business)

#### Digital products

Digital products are non-physical items or services that are delivered, given,
or rendered electronically. This includes digital goods and electronically
supplied services. We determine whether you’re selling digital products or
physical goods using the [product tax
code](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes) you assigned to your product.

Digital products are generally taxable in the country where your customer is
located. However sales of digital products to businesses in other countries
might have reverse charge applied. With reverse charge, your business provides
an invoice for the purchase so that your customer can calculate the tax.

#### Physical goods

When physical goods are shipped to a customer in a different country to your
business, the transaction is referred to as an export. Stripe doesn’t yet
support calculation on exports of physical goods in this region.

## Report and file your taxes

Stripe provides reports of your completed tax transactions. Go to
[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations) to access these
reports. Learn more about [the different types of
reports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports).

You’re responsible for filing and remitting your taxes. Stripe doesn’t file
taxes on your behalf.
