  "content": "# ACH Direct Debit\n\n## Learn how businesses can accept payments with ACH Direct Debit.\n\nThere are two ways to accept US bank debits on Stripe: ACH Direct Debit and\n[Instant Bank\nPayments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/instant-bank-payments). This\nguide describes ACH Direct Debit and helps you choose the best bank debit type\nfor your business.\n\nACH lets you accept payments from customers with a US bank account. ACH Direct\nDebit is a [reusable](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#usage),\n[delayed\nnotification](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#payment-notification)\npayment method. It can take [up to 4 business\ndays](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ach-direct-debit#timing) to receive\nacknowledgement of success or failure. Because ACH Direct Debit isn’t a\nguaranteed payment method, there’s a risk of failed payments and\n[disputes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ach-direct-debit#disputed-payments).\n\nAccepting bank accounts is slightly different from accepting cards:\n\n- Your customer must\n[authorize](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ach-direct-debit#mandates) the\npayment terms.\n- Bank accounts must be\n[verified](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ach-direct-debit#verification).\nPayment method propertiesBusiness locationsProduct support- **Customer\nlocations**\n\nUS\n- **Presentment currency**\n\nUSD\n- **Payment confirmation**\n\nBusiness-initiated\n- **Payment method family**\n\nBank debit\n- **Recurring payments**\n\nYes\n- **Payout timing**\n\n2-5 days\n- **Connect support**\n\n[Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ach-direct-debit#connect)\n- **Dispute support**\n\n[Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ach-direct-debit#disputed-payments)\n- **Manual capture support**\n\nNo\n- **Refunds / Partial refunds**\n\n[Yes / Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ach-direct-debit#refunds)\n\n## Payment flow\n\n!\n\nAt checkout, the customer selects **ACH Direct Debit**.\n\n!\n\nThe customer signs into their bank account to provide account information.\n\n!\n\nThe merchant presents the mandate. The customer accepts it by completing the\npurchase.\n\n!\n\nThe customer is notified when payment is complete.\n\n## Get started\n\nIf ACH is all you want, learn how to [accept a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ach-direct-debit/accept-a-payment)\nwith ACH. Below are options to skip writing that code.\n\n### Dynamic payment methods\n\nYou don’t have to integrate ACH Direct Debit and other payment methods\nindividually. If you use our front-end products, Stripe automatically determines\nthe most relevant payment methods to display. Go to the [Stripe\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and enable ACH\nDirect Debit. To get started with one of our hosted UIs, follow a quickstart:\n\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart): Our prebuilt, hosted\ncheckout page.\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart): Our drop-in UI\ncomponents.\n\n### Other payment products\n\nThe following Stripe products also let you add ACH Direct Debit from the\nDashboard:\n\n- [Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/no-code-guide)\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n- [Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview)\n\n### Manually add each payment method\n\nIf you prefer to manually list payment methods or want to save ACH Direct Debit\ndetails for future payments, see the following guides:\n\n- [Manually configure ACH Direct Debit as a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ach-direct-debit/accept-a-payment)\n- [Save ACH Direct Debit details for future\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ach-direct-debit/set-up-payment)\n\n## Timing\n\nWith ACH Direct Debit, it can take time for funds to become available in your\nStripe balance. The amount of time it takes for funds to become available is\nreferred to as the settlement timing. The following tables describe the\nsettlement timings for ACH Direct Debit payments that Stripe offers.\n\nInitial payments made from select bank accounts that use temporary account\nnumbers with Financial Connections might be subject to settlement delays.\n\nSettlement typeTimingCutoff timeAdditional informationStandard settlement (T+4)4\nbusiness days from payment creation21:00 US/EasternAfter ACH Direct Debit\npayments settle to your Stripe account balance, we make payouts to your bank\naccount according to your set payout schedule.Faster settlement (T+2)2 business\ndays from payment creation14:00 US/EasternThis option is available only to\neligible US users. You can check your eligibility and activate this option on\nthe [Payment methods\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods). For more\ninformation on faster settlement, see the\n[Support](https://support.stripe.com/questions/two-day-settlement-for-ach-direct-debit)\npage.\n\n!\n\nA diagram showing the two settlement timings for ACH Direct Debit: standard (4\ndays) and faster (2 days).\n\nFor information on how to cancel payments, see [Refund and cancel\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/refunds#cancel-payment).\n\n## Transaction failures\n\nACH Direct Debit transactions can fail any time after the payment is initiated\nthrough payment confirmation. These failures can occur for a number of reasons,\nsuch as:\n\n- Insufficient funds\n- An invalid account number\n- A customer disabling debits from their bank account\n\nIf a payment fails after funds have been made available in your Stripe balance,\nStripe immediately removes funds from your Stripe account.\n\nIn rare situations, Stripe might receive an ACH failure from the bank after a\nPaymentIntent has transitioned to `succeeded`. If this happens, Stripe creates a\ndispute with a `reason` of:\n\n- `insufficient_funds`\n- `incorrect_account_details`\n- `bank_cannot_process`\n\nStripe charges a failure fee in this situation.\n\n## Verification\n\nLearn about [validation and\nverification](https://support.stripe.com/questions/nacha-bank-account-validation-rule)\nrequirements.\n\nStripe lets your customers securely share their financial data by linking their\nfinancial accounts to your business. Use [Financial\nConnections](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections) to access\ncustomer-permissioned financial data such as tokenized account and routing\nnumbers, balance data, ownership details, and transaction data.\n\nYour customers might enter their bank account manually instead of authenticating\nwith Stripe Financial Connections. In these cases, Stripe provides a\nfully-hosted flow for collecting bank account details and verifies them with\nmicrodeposits.\n\nWhen you use [Stripe.js](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements), our\nJavaScript library for building payment flows, Stripe provides a fully-hosted\ncollection of bank account details, instant bank verification, and (if needed)\ndelayed verification using microdeposits. This verification process is a\nrequirement for many businesses, and it helps reduce payment failures and\nfraudulent activities.\n\n## Mandates\n\nACH Direct Debit rules require that you first get authorization from a customer\nto take payments before you can debit their bank account. To obtain\nauthorization, you present a mandate to them. This mandate specifies the terms\nfor one-time or recurring payments. The customer must agree to this mandate\nbefore you can collect any payments from their bank account.\n\nWhen you use Stripe to initiate ACH transactions with your customers, make sure\nyou have all the necessary authorizations and approvals from your customers for\nStripe to transmit an ACH debit transaction to the customer’s bank account. The\ninformation you provide Stripe about each ACH transaction must be accurate and\ncomplete, including the name of your customer that authorized you to initiate\nthe ACH transaction to their bank account.\n\n#### Types of mandates\n\nThere are two types of mandates: online and offline.\n\n- **Online mandates**: Appear as part of the payment flow on a website.\nCustomers accept online mandates through a user interface element, such as\nclicking an **Accept** or **Pay** button, or by checking a box.\n- **Offline mandates**: Require that you present the specific terms of the\ntransaction to your customer in writing or over the phone. The customer accepts\nthose terms when they sign the paper or verbally agree to the terms over the\nphone. See the [details on the offline mandate\ntypes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ach-direct-debit/sec-codes) Stripe\nsupports.\n\nStripe displays an online mandate on the payment page for you if you use one of\nthe following hosted products:\n\n- Checkout\n- Payment Element\n- Hosted Invoices Page\n\n### Mandates for online custom payment forms\n\nFor custom payment forms that directly integrate with the Payment Intents API,\nyou must display the mandate terms on your payment page before confirming the\nPaymentIntent or SetupIntent.\n\nYou only need to display a mandate the first time you collect a customer’s bank\naccount.\n\n#### Recommended mandate text (online)\n\nWe recommend that you use the following mandate text for your online custom\npayment form. This text must include the customer’s name, bank account\ninformation, and the date.\n\nFor details on displaying the correct business name for Connect users, see\n[merchant of record and statement\ndescriptors](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ach-direct-debit#connect-merchant-of-record).\n\nBy clicking [accept], you authorize Rocket Rides to debit the bank account\nspecified above for any amount owed for charges arising from your use of Rocket\nRides’ services and/or purchase of products from Rocket Rides, pursuant to\nRocket Rides’ website and terms, until this authorization is revoked. You may\namend or cancel this authorization at any time by providing notice to Rocket\nRides with 30 (thirty) days notice.\nIf you plan to use the customer’s bank account for future payments with the\n[setup_future_usage](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-setup_future_usage)\nparameter or by [saving bank\ndetails](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ach-direct-debit/set-up-payment) for a\nfuture payment, also include:\n\nIf you use Rocket Rides’ services or purchase additional products periodically\npursuant to Rocket Rides’ terms, you authorize Rocket Rides to debit your bank\naccount periodically. Payments that fall outside of the regular debits\nauthorized above will only be debited after your authorization is obtained.\n#### Caution\n\nIf you originate recurring preauthorized debits, you must disclose to your\ncustomers how these amounts are calculated or a range the customer can\nanticipate. You must also give your customer at least 7 calendar days notice if\nyou change the timing of any recurring preauthorized debits.\n\n### Mandate and microdeposit emails\n\nBy default, if your customer provides a [billing email\naddress](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object#payment_method_object-billing_details-email),\nStripe automatically emails your customer the following information:\n\n- Confirmation of the mandate, per Nacha requirements.\n- Notification if Stripe needs to use microdeposits to verify your customer’s\nbank account. These notification emails link to a hosted verification page.\n\n#### Sending custom mandate notifications (online)\n\nYou can send custom mandate notifications to customers.\n\nTo send custom mandate notifications:\n\n- Turn off Stripe emails in the Stripe Dashboard [email\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/emails)\n- Send a mandate confirmation email when you receive your customer’s bank\naccount and mandate authorization.\n\nIn the email, include the following information:\n\n- Authorization date\n- Account holder name\n- Financial institution\n- Routing number\n- Last four digits of the account number\n\nThe following is a sample mandate confirmation email that you can send.\n\nAgreement DateJune 28, 2021Account Holder NameJenny RosenFinancial\nInstitutionChase BankRouting Number021000021Account Number****6789Thank you for\nsigning up for direct debits from Rocket Rides. You have authorized Rocket Rides\nto debit the bank account specified above for any amount owed for charges\narising from your use of Rocket Rides’ services and/or purchase of products from\nRocket Rides, pursuant to Rocket Rides’ website and terms, until this\nauthorization is revoked. You may amend or cancel this authorization at any time\nby providing notice to Rocket Rides with 30 (thirty) days notice.\nIf you collected the customer’s bank account for future payments with the\n[setup_future_usage](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-setup_future_usage)\nparameter or by [saving bank\ndetails](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ach-direct-debit/set-up-payment), also\ninclude:\n\nYou have authorized Rocket Rides to debit your bank account periodically if and\nwhen you use Rocket Rides’ services or purchase more than one of Rocket Rides’\nproducts periodically pursuant to Rocket Rides’ terms. Payments that fall\noutside of the regular debits authorized above will only be debited after your\nauthorization is obtained.\n#### Caution\n\nIf you choose to send custom emails, you also need to send microdeposit reminder\nemails. For detailed instructions, see [Custom microdeposit email and\nverification\npage](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ach-direct-debit/accept-a-payment?web-or-mobile=web&payment-ui=direct-api#optional:-send-custom-email-notifications).\n\n## Disputes\n\nACH Direct Debit provides a dispute process for bank account holders to dispute\npayments. Customers can generally dispute a payment through their bank for up to\n60 calendar days after a debit on a personal account, or up to 2 business days\nfor a business account. In rare instances, a debit payment can be successfully\ndisputed outside these timelines. This is called a late return. The late return\nprocess is primarily managed by and ultimately decided at the discretion of the\nbanks involved in the transaction.\n\nWhen a dispute is created, Stripe sends both the\n[charge.dispute.created](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-charge.dispute.created)\nand\n[charge.dispute.closed](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-charge.dispute.closed)\n[webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) events and deducts the amount of the\ndispute and associated dispute fee from your Stripe balance.\n\nUnlike credit card disputes, all ACH Direct Debit disputes are final and there\nis no process for appeal. If a customer successfully disputes a payment, you\nmust contact them if you want to resolve the situation.\n\n#### Caution\n\nIf you proactively issue your customer a refund while the customer’s bank also\ninitiates the dispute process, your customer might receive two credits for the\nsame transaction. Follow the guidelines in the following section on refunds to\navoid this situation.\n\n### Resolving disputes\n\nWhen a customer disputes an ACH Direct Debit payment, it invalidates the mandate\nassociated with the payment method and you can’t reuse it. To attempt a charge\nagain, you must resolve the dispute with the customer and [collect a new mandate\nauthorization](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ach-direct-debit/accept-a-payment#resolving-disputes).\n\nIf they dispute a subsequent payment, Stripe blocks the bank account from\nfurther re-use. To learn more about resolution steps, see [Blocked bank\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ach-direct-debit/blocked-bank-accounts).\n\n## Refunds\n\nYou have a maximum of 180 days from the date of the original payment to submit a\nrefund for an ACH Direct Debit payment. Refunds require at least 3 business days\nto process. Stripe waits for the original payment to succeed before submitting\nthe refund.\n\n#### Avoid disputes\n\nIf you accidentally debit your customer, contact them immediately to avoid a\npayment dispute. Factors such as slightly longer settlement time periods and the\nway banks process ACH Direct Debit transactions can cause confusion between you,\nyour customer, your customer’s bank, and Stripe. For example, your customer\nmight contact both you and their bank to dispute a payment. If you proactively\nissue your customer a refund while the customer’s bank also initiates the\ndispute process, your customer might receive two credits for the same\ntransaction, so it’s important to communicate with your customer about the\nprocessing time and the status of their refund.\n\nStripe doesn’t explicitly label ACH Direct Debit refunds as refunds when we\ndeposit the funds back to a customer’s bank account. Instead, we process refunds\nas a credit and include a reference to the statement descriptor for the original\npayment.\n\n## Statement descriptors for ACH\n\nEvery ACH Direct Debit payment shows up on customers’ bank statements with the\n*name of the merchant*. For payments created with Stripe, the name of the\nmerchant is your Stripe account’s [statement\ndescriptor](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/statement-descriptors).\nYou can override this default behavior for every transaction independently by\nusing a [dynamic statement\ndescriptor](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents#dynamic-statement-descriptor).\nTo do so, specify the\n[statement_descriptor](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-statement_descriptor)\nparameter when creating the `PaymentIntent`.\n\n#### Caution\n\nYour statement descriptor truncates to the first 16 alphanumeric characters on\nthe bank statement. For example, if your statement descriptor is\n`ROCKETRIDESLIMITED`, the customer sees `ROCKETRIDESLIMIT`.\n\nAdditionally, statement descriptors cannot use the special characters `<`, `>`,\n`'`, or `\"`.\n\nThe table below illustrates the *merchant name* behavior you can expect on the\ncustomer’s bank statement:\n\nDefault statement descriptorDynamic statement descriptorMerchant nameBank\nstatement descriptorRocket RidesUnspecified`Rocket Rides``Rocket Rides`Rocket\nRides`Sunday Ride``Rocket Rides``Sunday Ride`\nEach bank formats these fields differently. Depending on your customer’s bank,\nsome fields may appear in all lowercase or uppercase.\n\n## Connect\n\nIf you use [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect), you must take the\nfollowing into consideration before you enable and use ACH Direct Debits.\n\n### Request ACH Debit capabilities for your connected accounts\n\nSet the `us_bank_account_ach_payments` capability to `active` on your platform\naccount, and for any connected accounts you want to enable for ACH debits. You\ncan also [request more account\ncapabilities](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities#requesting-unrequesting).\n\n#### Note\n\nStripe automatically refunds the application fee to your platform account when\nthe [destination charge](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges#destination)\nfor an ACH debit fails. Learn about [fees for failed\npayments](https://stripe.com/pricing/local-payment-methods#ach-direct-debit).\n\n### Merchant of record and statement descriptors\n\nThe [charge type](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges) of Connect payments\nmight change the default statement descriptor and the merchant name that appears\non the customer’s bank statement. The charge type can also change:\n\n- The merchant of record shown on the mandate\n- The merchant shown on confirmation emails\n- The merchant shown on microdeposit reminder emails\n\nThe merchant of record determines the Stripe account authorized to create\npayments with a particular\n[PaymentMethod](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object). To learn\nmore about sharing this authorization across multiple connected accounts, see\n[PaymentMethod and Mandate\ncloning](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ach-direct-debit#payment-method-and-mandate-cloning).\n\nCharge typeDescriptor taken fromDirectConnected\nAccountDestinationPlatformSeparate charge and transferPlatformDestination (with\n`on_behalf_of`)Connected AccountSeparate charge and transfer (with\n`on_behalf_of`)Connected Account\n### PaymentMethod and mandate cloning\n\nYou can collect customer bank accounts on the platform account and\n[clone](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges-multiple-accounts#clone-and-create-direct-charges)\nACH Direct Debit payment methods. Cloning these methods allows you to save\ncustomer bank accounts for later use on connected accounts. When you clone ACH\nDirect Debit payment methods, Stripe duplicates the mandate authorization to the\nconnected account, but we don’t send any new mandate confirmation emails.\n\n#### Caution\n\nIf a mandate is authorized for a PaymentIntent or SetupIntent\n[on_behalf_of](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges#on_behalf_of) a connected\naccount, you can’t use that mandate with a different connected account.\n\nWhen collecting a bank account that you intend to clone to connected accounts,\nyou must communicate to the customer that their authorization extends to\nconnected accounts on your platform. For example, you can communicate this\nmessage to a customer through the mandate terms. Failure to communicate this\nmessage to your customers could result in customer confusion and increase the\nrisk of disputed payments.\n\n### Connect and settlement\n\nSettlement speed is generally controlled at the platform level.

To do\nthis, provide an email in the `payment_method_data.billing_details[email]` field\nin the form of `{any-prefix}+test_email@{any_domain}` when you collect the\n[payment method\ndetails](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ach-direct-debit#web-collect-details).\n\n#### Common mistake\n\nYou need to [activate your Stripe\naccount](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/activate) before you can\ntrigger these emails in Test mode.\n\n### Test account numbers\n\nStripe provides several test account numbers and corresponding tokens you can\nuse to make sure your integration for manually-entered bank accounts is ready\nfor production.\n\nAccount numberTokenRouting\nnumberBehavior`000123456789``pm_usBankAccount_success``110000000`The payment\nsucceeds.`000111111113``pm_usBankAccount_accountClosed``110000000`The payment\nfails because the account is\nclosed.`000111111116``pm_usBankAccount_noAccount``110000000`The payment fails\nbecause no account is\nfound.`000222222227``pm_usBankAccount_insufficientFunds``110000000`The payment\nfails due to insufficient\nfunds.`000333333335``pm_usBankAccount_debitNotAuthorized``110000000`The payment\nfails because debits aren’t\nauthorized.`000444444440``pm_usBankAccount_invalidCurrency``110000000`The\npayment fails due to invalid\ncurrency.`000666666661``pm_usBankAccount_failMicrodeposits``110000000`The\npayment fails to send\nmicrodeposits.`000555555559``pm_usBankAccount_dispute``110000000`The payment\ntriggers a dispute.`000000000009``pm_usBankAccount_processing``110000000`The\npayment stays in processing indefinitely.
