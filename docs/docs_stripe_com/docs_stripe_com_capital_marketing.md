# Marketing your Capital programPrivate preview

## Build marketing assets for Capital.

This guide shows how to build marketing assets for Capital that educate your
users and promote the Capital program. Learn how to co-brand your product with
Stripe and develop content that adheres to [bank and regulatory
requirements](https://docs.stripe.com/capital/regulatory-compliance) applicable
to Capital.

Lending is a highly regulated space, and all customer-facing material
referencing Stripe Capital must be approved by Stripe and its bank partners
before publication. Submit material for review and approval using the [Change
Request
Form](https://form.asana.com/?k=8K51UWmWhttehNFD5qBLdg&d=974470123217835).

## Marketing requirements

Depending on your Capital integration type, additional platform marketing might
be optional.

- **No-Code integration**: For No-Code integrations, Stripe sends offer emails
on your behalf. While this isn’t required, we recommend that you [send an
announcement
email](https://docs.stripe.com/capital/marketing#announcement-email) and develop
a marketing landing page using our [messaging
guidelines](https://docs.stripe.com/capital/marketing#messaging).
- **API integration**: For API integrations where you’re responsible for
notifying users about their Capital offers, you must review the section on
[sending offer
notifications](https://docs.stripe.com/capital/marketing#financing-notifications)
to build an email campaign or in-Dashboard notifications with the [Capital
API](https://docs.stripe.com/capital/api-integration#retrieve-financing-offers).

#### Warning

You must submit any customer-facing materials related to Capital to Stripe for
review prior to being published using the [Change Request
Form](https://form.asana.com/?k=8K51UWmWhttehNFD5qBLdg&d=974470123217835).

## Marketing approval process

To make sure Stripe meets its marketing oversight requirements for platforms
offering Stripe Capital, you must maintain records of all marketing materials
you use to promote your Capital program. All marketing material must be
reviewed, approved, and retained by Stripe and its banking partner to ensure
compliance with regulatory requirements.

Items that must be submitted to Stripe for approval include:

- Email marketing including proposed targeting populations
- Website or UX material referencing the Stripe Capital product
- Blog posts or social media referencing the Stripe Capital product
- In-app or push notifications
- Customer testimonials

You must submit any marketing materials that you create to Stripe’s compliance
team for review prior to being published using the [Change Request
Form](https://form.asana.com/?k=8K51UWmWhttehNFD5qBLdg&d=974470123217835). Our
team of compliance specialists reviews these assets and will respond via email
with edits or an approval in a timely manner. The standard turnaround time is
5-7 business days.

To receive approval, the material must align with the requirements and
guidelines detailed in this guide. You may not use any marketing assets that
don’t pass Stripe review.

When submitting your materials, you must do the following:

- Read and adhere to the guidelines on this page. Marketing assets aren’t usable
until they have been approved by Stripe.
- Provide your platform name.
- Provide full screen shots or products that include headings and footers in a
legible or high resolution format.
- The preferable format for materials is PDF, however any format where all text
is legible is acceptable.
- Describe the type of marketing material you’re submitting (for example,
landing pages, web banners, emails, search engine marketing, and whether the
asset is text only or includes images and text). If submitting web pages,
include the associated URLs.
- Describe where all CTA links direct to (for example, a landing page URL or
log-in screens).

## Sending offer notifications

As part of your Capital marketing program, you can set up offer notifications so
your connected accounts know when they’re eligible for financing. You must
notify all eligible connected accounts about available offers.

You can use either a No-Code or API integration to notify eligible connected
accounts about their offer. With the No-Code option, Stripe sends co-branded
offer emails on your behalf. If you’re using the API integration, you must build
and deploy your own email campaign, or build out other methods of notifying your
customers when they’re eligible for an offer (for example, in-product
notifications or direct mail).

To get started select your integration type below.

No-CodeAPI
### No-Code email overview

Emails are a primary channel for notifying customers about their financing
offers. Stripe Capital handles this with our No-Code email service. Check the
[Launch
Checklist](https://docs.stripe.com/capital/no-code-integration#send-offers) for
more information on how to enable offer emails through Stripe.

All emails are co-branded with your logo and brand colors. To see the end-to-end
user experience, including the offer email, check out the [Capital demo
experience](https://dashboard.stripe.com/capital/demo). You can customize the
colors and logo in the email by adjusting your [Connect
settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/onboarding-interface).

#### Note

Adjusting Connect settings changes your branding for all of Connect, not just
Capital.

Stripe sends a series of emails to notify customers of their offer and keep them
informed about their repayment progress.

The following is a list of the emails Stripe sends:

- First offer email: This email notifies the customers about their first offer.
We send it as soon as a customer becomes eligible.
- Weekly update emails: If a customer has an active financing, we send them a
weekly email updating them on the current amount repaid, and linking to a
Stripe-hosted active loan page.
- Repeat offer email: After a customer has paid down their loan, we send them an
additional offer email as soon as they’re eligible.
- Offer email: If a customer doesn’t accept an offer, they’ll receive an
additional offer email every 30 days if they’re eligible.
- Additional transactional emails: In addition, Stripe will send other relevant
transactional emails to users, such as those relevant for application questions
or loan repayment.

Learn more about our [No-Code email
service](https://docs.stripe.com/capital/no-code-integration) or contact your
Stripe account team member.

## Messaging

Refer to the following copy guidelines when you write marketing copy for Stripe
Capital on any marketing assets. You can modify the wording to suit your
platform’s voice, as long as it conveys the same message and uses the correct
terminology as detailed below. Refer to
[stripe.com/capital](https://stripe.com/capital) to see how we employ these
messages for our direct Capital offering.

#### Warning

You must submit any customer-facing materials related to Capital to Stripe for
review prior to being published using the [Change Request
Form](https://form.asana.com/?k=8K51UWmWhttehNFD5qBLdg&d=974470123217835).

### Name your Capital program

Keep the name of your Capital program simple. If you already have a payments
program such as “Rocket Rides Payments," you can call it “Rocket Rides Capital”
or “Rocket Rides Business Financing." If you want to include Stripe in the name,
we recommend something like “Rocket Rides + Stripe Capital."

### Logos

Follow this format for partnership logos:

Template for partnership logos
| Stripe

- Place your logo on the left with the Stripe logo on the right.
- Join the two logos with a `|` symbol or `+` symbol.
- Make both logos the same size. Don’t make one larger or smaller than the
other.
- Use the [downloadable Stripe logo
kit](https://brandfolder.com/s/h3jbwkqfhbv9s9k4b9qpt3x). Don’t use the badge or
Connect button.

Main message in 100 words
Access to capital can be one of the most limiting growth factors. With Capital,
you can help jump start your business with flexible, on-demand financing. No
lengthy application or personal credit check required—eligible businesses are
automatically pre-qualified and can receive funds in as soon as 2 business days
after you’re approved. Get the financing you need today with Capital.

### Benefits and features

Here’s how you could describe the benefits and features of the program:

Benefits and features marketing template- No lengthy application: There’s no
personal credit check and no complicated application process. Eligibility is
based on factors like your payment volume and history on payment solution.
- Get funds quickly: Funds typically arrive in as soon as 2 business days,
directly into your account.
- One flat fee: Pay one flat fee that never changes. There are no compounding
interest charges or late fees.
- Pay when you get paid: Repayment is fully automated and adjusts to your daily
sales. Stripe deducts a fixed percentage of your sales until the total owed is
repaid. Every loan has a minimum payment amount (usually due every 60 days). If
the total amount repaid through sales doesn’t cover the minimum, you need to pay
the remaining balance at the end of the period. Automated repayments count
towards this minimum.

### How it works

Here is a template for explaining how the program works. Modify it as needed for
your situation. For example, if your customers may see their eligibility offer
in places other than email, like in-app notifications or banner ads, mention
them in the description of step one.

How it works marketing template- Check your eligibility: Check your email to see
if you’re eligible for an offer based on factors that include your payment
volume and history on payment solution.
- Select your offer: Select the amount that’s right for your business needs. The
loan fee and repayment rate are set based on the loan amount.
- Receive your funds: After our team reviews your application, the funds are
deposited into your account, typically as soon as 2 business days after
approval.
- Pay down as you earn: You’ll automatically repay the loan with a fixed
percentage of your daily sales, until the total amount is repaid. Every loan has
a minimum payment amount (usually due every 60 days). If the total amount repaid
through sales doesn’t cover the minimum, you need to pay the remaining balance
at the end of the period. Automated repayments count towards this minimum.

### Marketing to ineligible users

Not all customers are eligible for a Capital loan. Any marketing material that
is available to an audience of both eligible and ineligible users should clearly
explain how eligibility is determined, and how customers can learn if they have
an offer available. Direct marketing which only targets recipients ineligible
for financing isn’t currently supported. Here’s an example of the type of
language you can use on marketing content available to a broader audience of
both eligible and ineligible users:

Marketing to ineligible users template
Eligibility is based on a combination of factors, such as your payment history
on payments. If you’re eligible for an offer, we’ll send you an email. If you
haven’t received any notification from us, that means you’re not eligible for an
offer at this time.

If you’d like to receive a financing offer, but aren’t eligible at this time, we
recommend migrating more of your business’ payments to payment solution. While
not guaranteed, increased payment volume and your history with payment solution
might increase your likelihood of getting a financing offer.

### Required default disclaimer

All marketing collateral must mention our bank partner Celtic. You *must* add
the following disclaimer on any landing pages wherever you market Stripe
Capital:

Required default disclaimer
Loans are issued by Celtic Bank and powered by Stripe. All loans subject to
credit approval.

The disclaimer doesn’t need to be the same font size as the marketing message,
but it must be clear, conspicuous, and in a font color or drop shadow that’s in
contrast to its background.

## Promote your Capital program

When your Capital program goes live, you’ll want to share information about it.
Because not all of your customers will be eligible for Capital, it’s important
to make sure any broader marketing such as a landing page doesn’t promise
eligibility. Instead, you can use marketing to explain how the program works,
why it’s important, and where customers can check if they’re eligible. Review
our messaging guide for help crafting your marketing materials. We also
recommend referencing your broader vision for embedded finance if you’re also
using Stripe Treasury or Issuing.

#### Warning

You must submit any customer-facing materials related to Capital to Stripe for
review prior to being published using the [Change Request
Form](https://form.asana.com/?k=8K51UWmWhttehNFD5qBLdg&d=974470123217835).

### Announcement email

Whether you’re building a stand alone email or adding copy to an existing
newsletter, emails are a great way to introduce Capital to your customer base.
Try to keep your email short and to the point, but make sure to include these
key points:

- A brief introduction to the program
- Where customers will learn about their offer (Make sure to touch on
eligibility as not all visitors to your page will be eligible)
- Link to a blog post, landing page, or place where they can check their
eligibility
- Compliance disclosure (CAN-SPAM and Default disclaimer)

Refer to our messaging guide for help crafting your email copy.

### Landing pages and blog posts

Evergreen content like landing pages and blog posts can be a great way to excite
prospective customers about your financing program, and educate existing
customers about how it works. The following sections provide tips for developing
your content. We also recommend reviewing the messaging guide.

**Suggested page structure**

- Brief introduction to the program
- Why financing can help their business
- How the program works
- Where customers will learn about their offer (Make sure to touch on
eligibility as not all visitors to your page will be eligible)
- Links to FAQs, docs or any other pages you’d created
- Compliance disclosure (default disclaimer)

#### Landing page URL and site navigation

Here are a few templates for landing page URL options and site navigation
categories. You can also use the name of your program such as “[Platform name]
Capital” as the navigation category.

- `/capital`
- `/financing`
- `/business-financing`

### Blog-post content

We understand that blog posts are a common tool to increase your own company’s
organic growth, so you might decide to promote Stripe Capital through such
content. Because blog posts are not space constrained, you have some additional
things to consider when creating this type of marketing content:

- Comparisons: Due to the additional regulatory complexity of comparing Stripe
Capital against other competitors or different loan products, you may not
directly compare Stripe Capital against any competitors’ offerings.
- Testimonials: Writing about your customers experiences in a blog post related
to Stripe Capital falls under “testimonials” rules. These requirements are found
[here](https://docs.stripe.com/capital/regulatory-compliance#testimonials).
- Substantiating Claims: Blog posts sometimes make large claims about overall
successes, such as “Stripe Capital helps our users double their output.” Make
sure that you have accurate and verifiable data for any quantifiable claims. You
must validate these claims and provide supporting evidence upon request. Every
claim must be substantiated and readily available for the duration the content
is active, and for up to five years following its last use.

### Social posts

Social posts such as organic and paid ads can help drive awareness of your
program and tell a broader story about your investment in embedded finance.
Because much of this audience might not be eligible for a loan, refer to the
section [How to market to ineligible
users](https://docs.stripe.com/capital/marketing#market-ineligible).

Social media is often space constrained. When you create content for this
channel, don’t use approved marketing phrases out of context or reduced down to
be misleading. Don’t use language that references eligible loan amounts,
specific dollar amounts for loan fees, nor specific percentages of sales that go
towards repayment, because those are dynamically generated fields for formal
loan offers.

### Press releases

You can use press releases as a way to attract new customers or develop a larger
story about your company’s investment in embedded finance. We’re happy to help
you develop the right story and support its release. If you’re interested in
doing a press release, reach out to
[capital-review@stripe.com](mailto:capital-review@stripe.com).
