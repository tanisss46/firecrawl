# Collect tax in Georgia

## Learn how to use Stripe Tax to calculate, collect, and report tax in Georgia.

In Georgia, Stripe only supports collecting [VAT](https://nr.rs.ge/home) for
electronically supplied services. In Stripe, these are referred to as “digital
products.” To collect this tax on Stripe, you must be a remote seller without a
physical presence in the country.

## When to register for tax collection

See [Thresholds](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/thresholds) to get insights
about your potential tax registration obligations in Georgia. Stripe also
notifies you with email and Dashboard alerts when you need to register to
collect tax. Learn more about how the [monitoring tool
works](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/monitoring).

Remote sellers providing electronically supplied services (digital products) to
individuals in Georgia have no registration threshold. The Georgian tax
administration refers to a remote seller as a “foreign taxable person that pays
VAT without an obligation of registration.”

- **Threshold**: 1 transaction
- **Included transactions**: Business-to-consumer (B2C) sales of digital goods
and services

## How we calculate taxes

We only support calculations for [digital
products](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes?type=digital) (non-physical
items or services that are delivered, given, or rendered electronically) in
Georgia. Stripe doesn’t calculate tax for products that don’t use a digital
product tax code.

View the list of supported [digital product tax
codes](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes?type=digital). To calculate taxes
in Georgia, make sure that you [assign a tax
code](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/products-prices-tax-codes-tax-behavior#tax-code-on-product)
to each of your products.

## Report and file your taxes

Stripe provides reports of your completed tax transactions. Go to
[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations) to access these
reports. Learn more about [the different types of
reports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports).

You’re responsible for filing and remitting your taxes to Georgia. Stripe
doesn’t file taxes on your behalf.
