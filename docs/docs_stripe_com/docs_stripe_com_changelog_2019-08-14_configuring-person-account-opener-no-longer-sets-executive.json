  "content": "# Renames the platform_payments capability for accounts to card_payments, requiring the manual specification of the added transfers capabilityBreaking changes\n\n## What’s new\n\nIncludes multiple changes:\n\n- Renames the `platform_payments` capability to `transfers` to better indicate\nthe Stripe primitives that this capability supports.\n- Updates the `card_payments` capability to no longer imply `transfers`. When\ncreating an account, you now need to additionally request the `transfers`\ncapability.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis change renames the `platform_payments` capability to `transfers` and\ndecouples it from the `card_payments` capability. You now need to explicitly\nrequest the `transfers` capability when creating an account, even if they also\nrequest `card_payments`. This modification provides clearer terminology and more\ngranular control over account capabilities.\n\n## Upgrade\n\n- [View your current API\nversion](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#view-your-api-version-and-the-latest-available-upgrade-in-workbench)\nin Workbench.\n- If you use an SDK, upgrade to the corresponding SDK version for this API\nversion.- If you don’t use an SDK, update your [API\nrequests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/versioning) to include `Stripe-Version:\n2019-08-14`\n- Upgrade the API version used for [webhook\nendpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks/versioning).\n- [Test your integration](https://docs.stripe.com/testing) against the new\nversion.\n- If you use Connect, [test your Connect\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/testing).\n- In Workbench, [perform the\nupgrade](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#perform-the-upgrade).
