  "content": "# Pay by Bank payments\n\n## Offer your customers in the UK and Europe the option to pay directly from their bank account.\n\nPay by Bank is a single-use payment method that allows customers to pay directly\nfrom their bank account instead of using a card.\n\nPay by Bank runs on banking infrastructure and takes advantage of [open banking\nAPIs](https://www.openbanking.org.uk/what-is-open-banking). When a customer\nchooses Pay by Bank, they first select their bank and then approve the payment\non their bank’s mobile app or web portal.\n\nPay by Bank is available by default for payments between 0.50 GBP and 5,000 GBP.\nIf you want to accept Pay by Bank payments over that amount, reach out to\n[Stripe Support](https://support.stripe.com/)\n\nPayment method propertiesCountry availabilityProduct support- **Customer\nlocations**\n\nUnited Kingdom, Germany1\n- **Presentment currency**\n\nGBP, EUR1\n- **Payment confirmation**\n\nCustomer-initiated\n- **Payment method family**\n\nReal-time payments\n- **Recurring payments**\n\nNo\n- **Payout timing**\n\nStandard payout timing applies\n- **Connect support**\n\n[Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/pay-by-bank#connect)\n- **Dispute support**\n\n[No](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/pay-by-bank#disputes)\n- **Manual capture support**\n\nNo\n- **Refunds / Partial refunds**\n\n[Yes / Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/pay-by-bank#refunds)\n\n1Pay by Bank is coming to Germany in 2025.\n\nYou can register your interest in Pay by Bank in Germany in the form below.\n\n## Interested in getting early access to Pay by Bank in Germany?\n\nTo learn more or get early access, enter your email address below. We’ll\ndetermine your eligibility and guide you through the onboarding steps.\n\nCollect EmailSign upRead our [privacy policy](https://stripe.com/privacy).\n## Payment flow\n\n!\n\nCustomer selects Pay by Bank at checkout\n\n!\n\nCustomer chooses bank and gets redirected\n\n!\n\nCustomer enters account credentials\n\n!\n\nCustomer completes authorization process\n\n!\n\nCustomer is notified that payment is complete\n\n!\n\nCustomer returns back to business’s site for payment confirmation\n\n## Get started\n\nYou don’t have to integrate Pay by Bank and other payment methods individually.\nIf you use our front-end products, Stripe automatically determines the most\nrelevant payment methods to display. Go to the [Stripe\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and enable Pay\nby Bank. To get started with one of our hosted UIs, follow a quickstart:\n\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart): Our prebuilt, hosted\ncheckout page.\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart): Our drop-in UI\ncomponents.\n\nIf you prefer to manually list payment methods, learn how to [manually configure\nPay by Bank as a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/pay-by-bank/accept-a-payment).\n\n## Refunds\n\nYou can refund Pay by Bank payments for up to 730 days (2 years) after the\noriginal payment. You can refund part of the original payment or the entire\namount of the original payment. Refunds are free of charge but the processing\nfees for the original payment are non-refundable.\n\nStripe sends the refund back to the same bank account that initiated the\npayment. We notify you of the final refund status using the `refund.updated` or\n`refund.failed` [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) event. When a refund\nsucceeds, the status of the [Refund](https://docs.stripe.com/api/refunds/object)\nobject transitions to `succeeded`.\n\nA refund can fail if the customer’s bank can’t process it correctly (for\nexample, the bank account is closed). If a refund fails, the status of the\nRefund object transitions to `failed`. We’ll return the amount of the refund to\nyour Stripe balance. You’ll then need to arrange an alternative way of providing\nyour customer with a refund.\n\n## Disputes\n\nPay by Bank payments have a low risk of fraud or unrecognized payments because\nthe customer must authenticate the payment in their banking app. As a result, no\ndispute process exists that can result in a chargeback and funds being withdrawn\nfrom your Stripe account\n\n## Connect\n\nYou can use [Stripe Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/how-connect-works)\nwith Pay by Bank to process payments on behalf of a connected account. Connect\nusers can use Pay by Bank with the following charge types:\n\n- [Direct](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges)\n- [Destination](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges)\n- [Separate charges and\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n### Enable Pay by Bank for connected accounts that use the Stripe Dashboard\n\nConnected accounts that use the Stripe Dashboard can enable Pay by Bank in their\n[Payment methods\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) in the\nDashboard. To check which accounts have enabled Pay by Bank, use the\n`capabilities` hash in our [accounts webhooks or\nAPIs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-capabilities-pay_by_bank_payments)\nto see if the `pay_by_bank_payments` capability is set to `active`.\n\n### Enable Pay by Bank for connected accounts that use the Express Dashboard or a dashboard that isn’t hosted by Stripe\n\nTo onboard connected accounts that use the Express Dashboard or a dashboard that\nisn’t hosted by Stripe, request the `pay_by_bank_payments` capability using the\n[Capabilities API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/capabilities) For more details,\nfollow the instructions to [enable payment methods for your connected\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities).\n\n## Links\n\n- [open banking APIs](https://www.openbanking.org.uk/what-is-open-banking)\n- [Stripe Support](https://support.stripe.com/)\n- [Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/pay-by-bank#connect)\n- [No](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/pay-by-bank#disputes)\n- [Yes / Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/pay-by-bank#refunds)\n- [privacy policy](https://stripe.com/privacy)\n- [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods)\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart)\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart)\n- [manually configure Pay by Bank as a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/pay-by-bank/accept-a-payment)\n- [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks)\n- [Refund](https://docs.stripe.com/api/refunds/object)\n- [Stripe Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/how-connect-works)\n- [Direct](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges)\n- [Destination](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges)\n- [Separate charges and\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n- [accounts webhooks or\nAPIs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-capabilities-pay_by_bank_payments)\n- [Capabilities API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/capabilities)\n- [enable payment methods for your connected\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities)",
