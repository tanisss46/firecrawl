They complete the\npayment by scanning it using a Thailand bank app. You receive confirmation from\nStripe instantly when they complete the payment.\n\nPayment method propertiesBusiness locationsProduct support- **Customer\nlocations**\n\nThailand\n- **Presentment currency**\n\nTHB\n- **Payment confirmation**\n\nCustomer-initiated\n- **Payment method family**\n\nReal-time payments\n- **Billing support**\n\nYes\n- **Connect support**\n\nYes\n- **Dispute support**\n\n[Not applicable](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/promptpay#disputed-payments)\n- **Manual capture support**\n\nNo\n- **Refunds / Partial refunds**\n\n[Yes / Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/promptpay#refunds)\n\n## Payment flow\n\n!\n\n1.

Gets notification that payment is complete\n\n## Get started\n\nYou don’t have to integrate PromptPay and other payment methods individually. If\nyou use our front-end products, Stripe automatically determines the most\nrelevant payment methods to display. Go to the [Stripe\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and enable\nPromptPay. To get started with one of our hosted UIs, follow a quickstart:\n\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart): Our prebuilt, hosted\ncheckout page.\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart): Our drop-in UI\ncomponents.\n\n### Other payment products\n\nThe following Stripe products also let you add PromptPay from the Dashboard:\n\n- [Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/no-code-guide)\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n- [Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview)\n\n#### Note\n\nInvoices and Subscriptions only support the `send_invoice` [collection\nmethod](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-collection_method).\n\nIf you prefer to manually list payment methods, learn how to [manually configure\nPromptPay as a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/promptpay/accept-a-payment).\n\n## Refunds\n\nStripe supports refunds of PromptPay payments either through the\n[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments) or\n[API](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_refund). To complete a refund, your\ncustomer must tell us where to return the funds. Stripe automatically contacts\nthe customer at the email address provided at time of PaymentIntent confirmation\nand requests refund account information from them. Your customer must provide\nthe account number of the bank account from which the payment was made,\notherwise the refund might fail. We process the refund automatically after\nreceiving the refund account information.\n\n## Statement descriptors\n\nPromptPay doesn’t support customized statement descriptors, and it ignores the\nvalue specified in the\n[statement_descriptor](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-statement_descriptor).\nCustomers see the Stripe company name (`STRIPE PAYMENTS (THAILAND) LTD`) when\nthey complete payments on their banking app. They also see it on bank\nstatements, along with the amount and a unique reference code.\n\n## Repeated payments\n\nAfter a customer successfully completes a transaction, any attempt to use the\nsame QR code again can result in having the funds deducted from their bank\naccount. If Stripe receives any excess funds from your customers, we reimburse\nthem to your account balance and notify you. You’ll need to issue the refund to\nyour customers outside of Stripe (for example, with a check, cash, or store\ncredit).\n\n## Disputes\n\nPromptPay payments have a low risk of fraud or unrecognized payments because the\ncustomer must authenticate the payment through banking apps. However, cases of\nirregularities similar to disputes, or other unexpected or repeated payments can\noccur. Stripe reviews these cases, and might contact you or take other action if\nrequired.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Not applicable](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/promptpay#disputed-payments)\n- [Yes / Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/promptpay#refunds)\n- [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods)\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart)\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart)\n- [Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/no-code-guide)\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n- [Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview)\n- [collection\nmethod](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-collection_method)\n- [manually configure PromptPay as a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/promptpay/accept-a-payment)\n- [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments)\n- [API](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_refund)\n-\n[statement_descriptor](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-statement_descriptor)",
