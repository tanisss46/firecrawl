# Collect tax in Ukraine

## Learn how to use Stripe Tax to calculate, collect, and report tax in Ukraine.

In Ukraine, Stripe only supports collecting VAT for digital services. In Stripe,
these are referred to as “digital products.” To collect this tax on Stripe, you
must be a remote seller without a physical presence in the country.

## When to register for tax collection

See [Thresholds](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/thresholds) to get insights
about your potential tax registration obligations in Ukraine. Stripe also
notifies you with email and Dashboard alerts when you need to register to
collect tax. Learn more about how the [monitoring tool
works](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/monitoring).

Remote sellers providing digital goods or electronically supplied services
(digital products) to individuals in Ukraine have a registration threshold of
1,000,000 UAH for the previous calendar year. Sales to businesses don’t trigger
any obligations to register.

- **Threshold**: 1,000,000 UAH
- **Included transactions**: Business-to-consumer (B2C) sales of digital goods
or electronically supplied services (digital products).

## Register to collect tax

You must be a remote seller with no physical presence in Ukraine to collect this

Learn more about [how to add your
registration](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/registering#track-your-registrations-in-the-tax-dashboard)
in the Dashboard.

## How we calculate taxes

We only support calculations for [digital
products](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes?type=digital) (non-physical
items or services that are delivered, given, or rendered electronically) in
Ukraine. Stripe doesn’t calculate tax for products that don’t use a digital
product tax code.

View the list of supported [digital product tax
codes](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes?type=digital). To calculate taxes
in Ukraine, make sure that you [assign a tax
code](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/products-prices-tax-codes-tax-behavior#tax-code-on-product)
to each of your products.

To abide by sanctions laws and collect tax in Ukraine, Stripe needs additional
address information for customers located there. All customers with addresses in
Ukraine need to have a postal code on their address.

### If you enabled Tax after July 23, 2024

You can add your registration in Ukraine and start collecting tax. Your
customers in Ukraine will be asked for a country + postal code for the
transaction to go ahead.

### If you started using Tax on or before July 23, 2024

You won’t be able to turn on tax collection for Ukraine yet. If you don’t use
Payment Links or Checkout, some customer addresses in these locations might not
contain all the detail needed for tax calculation. Invoicing, Subscriptions, and
custom payment integrations won’t require the postal code automatically.

We’ve released a tool that enables you to export your customer addresses and see
which addresses won’t have the required address information for tax calculation
in Ukraine. Use the form below to request access. If you have existing
subscriptions, update any customer addresses to include a postal code. If you
don’t update this information, the [invoice won’t
finalize](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/customer-locations#finalizing-invoices-with-finalization-failures)
and the payment won’t be collected.

## Report and file your taxes

Stripe Tax has filing partners—Taxually, Marosa, and Hands-off Sales Tax
(HOST)—to help automate your tax filing. These partners automatically sync your
tax transaction data in real time, eliminating the need for manual data entry or
file transfers. Learn more about [tax
filing](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/filing).

Stripe also provides reports of your completed tax transactions. Go to
[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations) to access these
reports. Learn more about [the different types of
reports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports).
