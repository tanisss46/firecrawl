items or services that are delivered, given, or rendered electronically) in
Costa Rica. Stripe doesn’t calculate tax for products that don’t use a digital
product tax code.

codes](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes?type=digital). To calculate taxes
in Costa Rica, make sure that you [assign a tax
