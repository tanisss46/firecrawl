You can\nminimize the chances of an account being blocked, and you can take actions to\nunblock accounts if you understand the underlying reasons.\n\n## Reasons for blocked bank accounts\n\nWhen ACH Debits are returned for reasons other than insufficient funds (for\nexample, an account is closed or frozen), NACHA rules require originators of an\nACH Debit to review and confirm the bank account or take other action before\nreinitiating a debit. To comply with these Rules, Stripe blocks certain bank\naccounts until we can confirm that the issue causing the returns has been\nresolved. In addition to ensuring compliance with the NACHA rules, this process\nhelps businesses reduce fraud and avoid repeated dispute and return fees. We\ndon’t block bank accounts because of past insufficient funds returns.\n\n## Minimizing blocked customer bank accounts\n\nYou can minimize the risk of dealing with blocked customer bank accounts by\ntaking a few preventative steps. To minimize this risk, we recommend that you:\n\n- **Verify accounts using Financial Connections Instant Verification**—This\nhelps confirm accurate account details and verify account ownership.\n- **Prevent accidental disputes**—Use clear [statement\ndescriptors](https://support.stripe.com/questions/update-business-name-shown-on-customer-bank-statements)\nfor your business name that customers can easily recognize on their bank\nstatements, which minimizes the chance that a confused customer unintentionally\ndisputes your payments.\n- **Reduce bank auto-blocks**—Some banks and business accounts automatically\nreject ACH Debits attempts from unknown entities. To prevent this, have your\ncustomer provide [Stripe Company\nIDs](https://support.stripe.com/questions/ach-direct-debit-company-ids-for-stripe)\nto their bank to enable debits initiated by Stripe.\n\n## Identifying blocked accounts\n\nIn the Dashboard, ACH Debits that failed because blocked accounts are labeled\n`blocked` with an error message. When attempting to confirm a Payment Intent or\nSetup Intent, these blocked requests return an `HTTP 402` status and contain the\n`bank_account_unusable` error code. [Payment\nIntents](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents) also generate a failed\ncharge, while [Setup Intents](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents) create\na failed Setup Attempt instead.\n\n### Payment method status details\n\nAfter creating a US bank account payment method, the\n[us_bank_account.status_details.blocked](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object#payment_method_object-us_bank_account-status_details-blocked)\nfield renders if the account is blocked. You must make requests using a secret\nkey for the field to appear.\n\nYou can access the\n[network_code](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object#payment_method_object-us_bank_account-status_details-blocked-network_code)\nand [reason\nproperties](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object#payment_method_object-us_bank_account-status_details-blocked-reason)\ninside the PaymentMethod object to understand the details behind each block. The\n`network_code` contains the raw ACH return code associated with a previous\nfailed payment or dispute made with this account, while the `reason` is a\nsummary category that corresponds with the code’s semantic meaning.\n\nFor more information on removing blocks, consult the section on [handling\nblocked bank\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ach-direct-debit/blocked-bank-accounts#block-category-table)\nbelow for each `reason` value. When Stripe removes the block, the\n`us_bank_account.status_details.blocked` field stops rendering on all previously\naffected payment methods.\n\n### Listening to status changes\n\nStripe sends the\n[payment_method.automatically_updated](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-payment_method.automatically_updated)\nevent for all saved payment methods when a blockable ACH return is received.\nThis also includes any verified customer bank accounts that were created using\nthe Stripe [legacy ACH\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ach-direct-debit/migrating-from-charges).\n\nConsuming these events can provide advance notice if your business model relies\non recurring payments that need to be processed before a certain date. Inspect\nthe event data for the `us_bank_account.status_details.blocked` field, then work\nwith your customer to unblock or switch bank accounts before initiating future\npayments.\n\nYou receive equivalent events when the block is removed, indicating that payment\nmethods can be reused immediately, if an active mandate exists or you re-collect\none.\n\n## Handling blocked bank accounts\n\nIf a customer’s ACH bank account becomes blocked, the action you take depends on\nthe reason the account was blocked. To find the reason, go to the Payment Intent\nin the Dashboard and navigate down to the **All activity** section. Then, find\nthe `402 Error - A Request to create a PaymentIntent failed` event and locate\nthe `code` value in the `last_payment_error` field.\n\nReasonRecommended actionRequired documentation- `bank_account_closed`\n\nContact the customer to make sure their bank account is still active, and that\nother information associated with the account is current and correct. If the\ncustomer’s bank account is no longer valid or active, ask them to update their\npayment method for future debits.\n\nIf, after contacting the customer, you believe the bank account was blocked in\nerror, contact [Stripe Support](https://support.stripe.com/contact) with the\nrequired documentation. After we confirm this information, we can unblock the\naccount for future use.\n\nRecent screenshot of an online bank portal that shows the full routing number,\naccount number, and name of the account holder.\n\nOR\n\nLetter from the bank noting the account is still active, including the full\nrouting number, account number, and name of the account holder.\n\n- `bank_account_frozen`\n- `bank_account_restricted`\n\nContact the customer to make sure their bank account is still active, and that\nother information associated with the account is current and correct.

After their first dispute, Stripe revokes the\nassociated mandate and requires them to accept a new mandate authorization\nbefore additional debits can be attempted. If they dispute a second payment, the\nbank account is blocked.\n\nIf, after contacting the customer, you believe they unintentionally disputed\nthese payments, contact [Stripe Support](https://support.stripe.com/contact)\nwith the required documentation. After we confirm this information, we can\nunblock the account for future use.\n\nWritten communication from the bank with confirmation that the [Stripe ACH ID\nwas added to the\nallowlist](https://support.stripe.com/questions/ach-direct-debit-company-ids-for-stripe)\nand authorization restrictions are lifted. The written communication must\nconfirm that the customer has authorized future debits to this payment method\nand must include the account details, such as account number, routing number,\nand name of the account holder.\n\n## Links\n\n- [statement\ndescriptors](https://support.stripe.com/questions/update-business-name-shown-on-customer-bank-statements)\n- [Stripe Company\nIDs](https://support.stripe.com/questions/ach-direct-debit-company-ids-for-stripe)\n- [Payment Intents](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents)\n- [Setup Intents](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents)\n-\n[us_bank_account.status_details.blocked](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object#payment_method_object-us_bank_account-status_details-blocked)\n-\n[network_code](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object#payment_method_object-us_bank_account-status_details-blocked-network_code)\n- [reason\nproperties](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object#payment_method_object-us_bank_account-status_details-blocked-reason)\n- [handling blocked bank\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ach-direct-debit/blocked-bank-accounts#block-category-table)\n-\n[payment_method.automatically_updated](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-payment_method.automatically_updated)\n- [legacy ACH\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ach-direct-debit/migrating-from-charges)\n- [Stripe Support](https://support.stripe.com/contact)",
