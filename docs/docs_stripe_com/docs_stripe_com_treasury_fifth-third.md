# Integrate with Fifth Third BankPublic preview

## Add Fifth Third Bank to your existing Stripe Treasury integration.

Stripe collaborates with multiple bank partners to support its Global Payments
and Treasury Network. We’ve added Fifth Third Bank as a new bank partner for
Stripe’s Treasury product.

If you’re already using Stripe Treasury, this guide describes how Treasury works
with Fifth Third Bank.

If you’re launching with Treasury for the first time, see [Get started with a
new Treasury integration using Fifth Third
Bank](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/fifth-third-get-started).

## Stripe Treasury accounts structure

The overall structure of [Treasury
accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/account-management/treasury-accounts-structure)
remains unchanged. You can continue using
[Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect) to maintain your existing platform
account, along with a connected account for each of your users. Because each
connected account represents a user, it’s associated with that user’s KYC and
compliance information. As you enable additional Stripe products for each of
your connected accounts (such as Payments with additional payment methods,
Treasury, or Issuing), you can reuse that user’s information without needing to
re-collect it.

Each connected account can create and maintain one or more Treasury financial
accounts, each of which represents an FDIC insurance-eligible account. Treasury
financial accounts are each created with one bank partner (now including Fifth
Third Bank). Each connected account can have up to three total financial
accounts across bank partners, unless your platform has been approved for a
higher limit. If you have a business reason for a higher limit, contact your
sales representative or [email us](mailto:treasury-support@stripe.com).

![Fifth Third Bank
diagram](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fifth-third-diagram.850467c15f4bd2e7ec94da205e871c85.png)

Each financial account can receive funds from the Connect payments balance, and
can transfer funds to and from other financial accounts and external bank
accounts.

You can use the same APIs with your Fifth Third financial accounts that you use
with your Evolve financial accounts. The APIs behave the same, apart from a few
key differences:

- OutboundTransfers sent from a Fifth Third financial account over wire or ACH
use later cutoff times than transfers sent with Evolve.
- Stripe Payouts sent from the payments balance arrive into a Fifth Third
financial account faster than payouts into an external bank account or an Evolve
financial account.
- You can use a new capability, `treasury_fifth_third`, to manage compliance for
your connected accounts.

There might be additional [near-term
differences](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/fifth-third#feature-availability-on-fifth-third)
while we build Fifth Third Bank to parity with Evolve, such as an interim limit
on received debit amounts.

#### Note

The roadmap above is intended to outline our general product direction (and our
priorities as they stand today) and is for informational purposes only. It’s not
a commitment to deliver any material, code, or functionality, and you shouldn’t
rely upon it when making purchasing decisions. The development, release, and
timing of any features or functionality described for Stripe’s products remains
at the sole discretion of Stripe.

## Migrating to Fifth Third Bank

Stripe will partner with you to migrate your financial accounts from Evolve Bank
& Trust to Fifth Third. If Stripe manages your migration, you don’t necessarily
need to update your Treasury API calls, but you still need to review this guide.
It contains information about how Treasury works with Fifth Third, such as
changes to transfer timing and connected account compliance.

You also have the option to customize your migration, but you must notify Stripe
by December 3.

## Request Fifth Third Bank access for new or existing connected accounts

Use `POST /v1/accounts` to create a new connected account. To enable the account
to use Stripe Treasury, request the following required capabilities for the
account:

- `transfers` (required for all connected accounts)
- `treasury` (required for your Treasury integration)
- `treasury_fifth_third` (new and required for Fifth Third Bank access)
- Continue to request the same
[capabilities](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/account-management/connected-accounts)
you currently request.

When you request capabilities, the `requirements.currently_due hash` on your
connected account’s
[Account](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-requirements-currently_due)
object populates with the requirements that must be fulfilled to enable the
capabilities. If the connected account already provides fields, Stripe reuses
them without requiring resubmission. You can continue to use either hosted
onboarding or the Stripe API to collect fields.

If you already have a connected account with Treasury enabled, use `POST
/v1/accounts/{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}` to update the account with the associated
ID with a request for the `treasury_fifth_third` capability.

Requesting the `treasury_fifth_third` capability doesn’t require any new fields
compared to the `treasury` capability. However, Fifth Third Bank access requires
either a URL or a product description that’s at least 10 characters and an
account representative who’s based in the US. This differs from the `treasury`
capability, which has no minimum character requirements for the product
description. Therefore, if the connected account hasn’t provided a URL and has a
product description shorter than 10 characters, you must provide a URL or update
the product description to meet the 10-character minimum.
[Preview](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/fifth-third#request-fifth-third-bank-access-for-new-or-existing-connected-accounts)
the `treasury_fifth_third` capability on each live connected account to make
sure that there are no additional requirements for that account. To reduce the
chance of review delays and requests for more detail, provide product
descriptions of at least 30 characters.

The following two fields help you confirm that each connected account is
supportable for Stripe:

- **URL**: Provide a URL to ensure the highest chance that your connected
account is approved for supportability. Stripe reviews each connected account’s
URL to make sure it qualifies as a [supportable
business](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/requirements). We recognize
legitimate cases where a connected account doesn’t have a URL (for example, it
isn’t an online business or hasn’t launched a website yet), so a URL isn’t
strictly required by the Accounts requirements hash, and we won’t block access
to the `treasury_fifth_third` capability if the connected account can’t provide
a URL. However, we expect you to provide a URL if one is available, and we’ll
perform manual compliance reviews to make sure that you collect URLs. A URL is
already a requirement for the `card_payments` and `us_bank_account_ach_payments`
capabilities, meaning you might already collect a URL if you request either of
these capabilities.
- **Product description**: If you don’t submit a URL, we assess the product
description field to determine if we can support your connected account, which
must be 10 characters or longer. If an existing connected account has no URL and
a product description under 10 characters, you must provide a longer description
to gain access to Fifth Third. We recommend guiding connected accounts to submit
a product description that reflects the purpose of opening a Treasury financial
account and its intended use, with as much detail as possible. That minimizes
the likelihood of restrictions or other issues with the financial account. To
reduce the chance of review delays and requests for more detail, provide product
descriptions of at least 30 characters.

You can submit product descriptions or any other requirements ahead of time, or
wait until the user switches operations to Fifth Third. Requesting the
`treasury_fifth_third` capability before then won’t affect your users’ live
Payments or Treasury business operations.

After you fulfill all requirements for both the `treasury_fifth_third` and
`treasury` capabilities, you can use your connected account to create financial
accounts at Evolve and Fifth Third Bank.

- **Account Representative**: We validate that your account representative is
based in the US when requesting the `treasury_fifth_third` capability. If we
determine that your account representative isn’t based in the US, we might not
grant your connected account the capability. See [Treasury
requirements](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/requirements#supported-countries)
for more information.

### Check the status for a connected account’s access to Fifth-Third

As your connected accounts onboard onto Fifth Third, Stripe will review each
connected account to make sure that it’s a supportable use case. Your users
might need to provide additional information, such as proof of licenses for
their industry. Based on the information they provide, Stripe might not support
the account. Learn more about [Treasury supportability
reviews](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/account-management/supportability).

#### Note

If you’ve already received Stripe approval for your connected accounts with
Fifth Third Bank and later update either your connected account’s URL or product
description, Stripe reassess the account for supportability. The result might
change or initiate a new review.

### Troubleshoot compliance plan error codes

When you request the `treasury_fifth_third` capability for your platform’s
connected accounts, you must provide a URL or a product description to establish
the supportability of your connected account using Fifth Third Bank. If you
submit a URL, you might encounter error codes.

- `invalid_url_format`: The format of the URL you submitted is incorrect or a
string. Update the URL to a valid format (for example, `.com` or `.org`).
- `invalid_url_denylisted`: This indicates that the submitted URL is on a Stripe
“denylist.” [Reach out to us](mailto:treasury-support@stripe.com) for support.
- `invalid_url_website_inaccessible`: The URL you submitted might be password
protected. Your connected account’s website must be accessible to allow
supportability assessments.
- `invalid_url_website_incomplete`: The URL you submitted returns a `404` status
error code.
- `Invalid_url_website_other`: If Stripe returns this error, [reach out to
us](mailto:treasury-support@stripe.com) for support.

If the URL field continues to return errors or you can’t remediate it with your
connected account, submit a product description instead.

## Create financial accounts at Fifth Third Bank

### Create a FinancialAccount

To create a new FinancialAccount at Fifth Third Bank for a connected account
with the required capabilities active, use `POST
/v1/treasury/financial_accounts` and include the connected account ID as the
value of the `Stripe-Account header` of the call.

Specify `features[financial_addresses][aba][bank]="fifth_third"` when creating
the financial account to make sure that it’s not created at Evolve. After you
create the financial account, you can’t change its bank partner.

Request an externally addressable account number and routing number
(`financial_addresses.aba`) by specifying
`features[financial_addresses][aba][requested]="true"`.

To create a Fifth Third financial account for a connected account, make sure
that the connected account doesn’t have a financial account with a negative
balance. To avoid a `404` error, all financial accounts must contain a balance
of 0 USD or higher.

You can request the same features on the Fifth Third financial account that
you’ve requested on your Evolve financial accounts, including
`outbound_transfers`, `outbound_payments`, and [other
features](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/account-management/financial-account-features).
If you request a [financial account
Feature](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/account-management/financial-account-features)
that hasn’t been released for Fifth Third Bank yet, Stripe returns the following
error: “You cannot request `{_feature_}` on a financial account with bank
`fifth_third`.”

### Update, retrieve, and close a FinancialAccount

There are no changes to the APIs used to update a financial account, close a
financial account, or retrieve a financial account. For more information, see
[Working with financial
accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/account-management/financial-accounts).

### FinancialAccount webhooks

We support [all financial account
webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/account-management/financial-accounts#webhooks),
including:

- `account.updated`
- `treasury.financial_account.created`- Triggered whenever a new
FinancialAccount is created.
- `treasury.financial_account.closed`
- `treasury.financial_account.features_status_updated`- Indicates that one or
more Features have changed status. This is reflected in changes to the
`active_features`, `pending_features` or `restricted_features` arrays.

## Moving money with Fifth Third financial accounts

### Overview of money movement

Stripe Treasury offers many types of money movement in and out of financial
accounts. You can categorize each transaction type in four ways:

- **Credit or debit**: A credit is an instruction to send money out of an
account and decrease assets, while a debit is an instruction to receive money
into an account and increase assets.
- **Received or originated**: This specifies whether the credit versus debit is
applied to the financial account (received) or to the other party’s account
(originated). For example, an originated credit sends money out of the financial
account, lowering the balance, while a received credit brings money into the
financial account, increasing the balance.
- **Rail**: Each type of money movement is supported by one or more rail, such
as ACH, wire, Stripe network, check, and Issuing transactions.
- (Optional) **Funds in or funds out**: This is an optional way to specify
whether money leaves or enters a financial account.

## Originate Transactions for the financial account

### Originate a credit with an OutboundTransfer or OutboundPayment

To move funds out of a Fifth Third financial account, you can create an
[OutboundTransfer](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/financial-accounts/out-of/outbound-transfers)
to send funds between two accounts with the same owner, or
[OutboundPayment](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/financial-accounts/out-of/outbound-payments)
to send funds between different account holders.

You can transfer funds to another financial account owned by your platform using
the Stripe network. Funds arrive within an hour. To send over the Stripe
network, you must [enter a financial account
ID](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/financial-accounts/out-of/outbound-payments#create-obp-for-fa)
into the `destination_payment_method_data` field instead of an account and
routing number.

Alternatively, you can instruct Stripe to send the transaction using wire or
ACH. If you submit before the published cutoffs, you’ll receive tracking
information by the end of the day when you originate a wire. Depending on the
destination bank and the time of submission, our bank partner might send
domestic wire transfers over either FedWire or CHIPS network. If you originate a
wire out of a financial account at Evolve, it’s sent using FedWire. If you
originate a wire out of a financial account at Fifth Third Bank, it’s sent using
CHIPS provided the receiving bank accepts CHIPS and the wire is sent during
CHIPS operating hours; otherwise, it’s sent using FedWire.

For wires sent using FedWire, locate the IMAD and OMAD fields in the
`tracking_details[us_domestic_wire][imad]` and
`tracking_details[us_domestic_wire][omad]` fields.

For wires sent using CHIPS, locate the transfer’s System Sequence Number in
`tracking_details[us_domestic_wire][chips]`. You can share these IDs with the
receiving bank to track the wire transfer’s status.

If you submit ACH transactions before the published ACH submission window
cutoffs, you’ll typically receive tracking information from your bank by the end
of the day.

The originated wire and ACH cutoff timing with Fifth Third Bank is extended
later than the Evolve timeline:

EvolveFifth Third BankWires4:00pm ET5:00pm ETACH7:00pm ET8:30pm ETSame-day
ACH12:00pm ET1:00pm ET
If you submit transfers shortly after the cutoff, they might still be processed
that evening, but it’s not guaranteed.

For more information about these APIs, see
[OutboundTransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/financial-accounts/out-of/outbound-transfers)
and
[OutboundPayments](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/financial-accounts/out-of/outbound-payments).

### Originate a debit with an InboundTransfer

You can originate debits using
[InboundTransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/financial-accounts/into/inbound-transfers).
InboundTransfers are always originated using ACH and are subject to [Originated
Transaction submission
cutoffs](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/fifth-third#originate-cutoffs).

## Payouts from Stripe payments

If you or your connected accounts use Stripe Payments, you can send acquired
funds into your Fifth Third financial account using the standard [Payouts
APIs](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/payouts). You can continue
using your current payout setup, and switch to pay out into Fifth Third
financial accounts by following the instructions below.

When you create payouts without accelerating access to pending funds,
transferring funds into Fifth Third financial accounts results in faster payout
speeds compared to Evolve financial accounts or external bank accounts.

Decide whether you want to set up an automatic payout schedule or only create
manual payouts, and whether to accelerate access to pending funds:

- **Automatic or manual**: You can set up an automatic payout schedule for a
connected account to pay out funds daily or on another cadence. You can also
create manual payouts at any time with an automatic payout schedule. Automatic
payouts always populate the
[reconciliation_status](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payouts/object#payout_object-reconciliation_status)
on the Payout object and trigger the corresponding
payout.reconciliation_completed event; however, manual payouts don’t.
- **Standard or accelerated access**: You can [accelerate access to pending card
funds](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/payouts#automatic-payout-speeds)
to pay out in either a manual or an automatic payout. When you acquire card
payment volume, funds [typically become available in the
balance](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/payouts#automatic-payout-speeds)
two business days after funds are received. You can pay to accelerate access, by
either creating an instant manual payout (`method=instant`), or setting a
connected account to an accelerated automatic payout schedule (`delay_days=1`),
associated with respective fees. This won’t accelerate access to pending funds
from ACH or other payment methods, only cards.

To accelerate access to funds, you must obtain a one-time platform credit risk
approval if you haven’t already enabled
[accelerated](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/payouts#automatic-payout-speeds)
or [instant payouts](https://support.stripe.com/topics/instant-payouts) with
Stripe. Enabling accelerated payouts might increase your platform risk by
allowing connected accounts to withdraw funds more quickly. To access this
feature for cards or for ACH, contact your sales representative.

### Payout timing improvements

Payouts that you create into Fifth Third financial accounts arrive faster than
payouts sent to external bank accounts or to Evolve financial accounts.

### Manual payout options

You have two options for manual payouts: `standard` and `instant`.

- [Standard manual
payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/payouts#manual-payout-speeds):
These only include settled payments funds, not pending payments funds. Settled
funds are expected to arrive within a few hours, meaning that new card payments
arrive in approximately 1-2 days after pay-in capture. This timing is an
improvement compared to payouts into Evolve financial accounts or external bank
accounts, where settled funds arrive approximately 1 day after the payout
request or 2–3 days after pay-in capture. Stripe doesn’t guarantee precise
payout timing.
- [Instant manual
payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/payouts#manual-payout-speeds):
These draw from both pending and settled funds. When you acquire card payment
volume, funds [typically become available in the
balance](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/payouts#automatic-payout-speeds)
two business days after funds are received. Other payment types, such as ACH
payments, take longer. Funds are pending until they’re available. When you
create an instant manual payout, you can include all funds in the
`instant_available` balance. Instant manual payouts are expected to arrive
within a few hours, which is the same behavior for Fifth Third financial
accounts as for Evolve financial accounts or external bank accounts.

If your platform isn’t enabled for faster payouts and you’re interested in
adding this ability, contact your sales representative or email us as
[treasury-support@stripe.com](mailto:treasury-support@stripe.com).

### Automatic payout options

You can optionally set up an automatic payout schedule for each connected
account. Stripe creates payouts on a specified cadence (such as daily) for all
funds that are made available, and sends the funds to your specified external
bank account (such as the financial account).

You can control the speed of your automatic payouts by setting two parameters on
[settings.payouts.schedule](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-settings-payouts-schedule):

- `interval`: You can define how frequently funds are paid out. You can set this
to `daily`, `weekly`, or `monthly`. Alternatively, you can set this to `manual`,
which disables automatic payouts in favor of manual payouts only.
- `delay_days`: If your business is based [in the
US](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts#delay-behavior-per-account-country), you can
define the number of business days that charges are pending before they’re made
available for standard payouts. The default is 2 days. You can set a higher
number to lower risk or a lower number to accelerate access to pending funds.

You can set intervals to daily and `delay_days=2`, in which case funds arrive
approximately 1–2 business days after pay-in capture. This timing is an
improvement over the current process with Evolve, where funds would arrive 2–3
days after pay-in capture.

You can accelerate access by setting interval to daily and `delay_days=1`, in
which case funds arrive approximately 1 business day after pay-in capture. If
you’re interested in funds arriving on non-business days, contact your sales
representative.

Use [POST
/v1/accounts/{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-settings-payouts-schedule)
to [update the payout
schedule](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/payouts#t+1-automatic-payout-schedule).

## Update payouts to use a Fifth Third financial account

### Set up a financial account for payouts

Before you can send payouts to a Treasury financial account or receive top-ups
from a Treasury financial account, you must [set the financial account as an
external account (BankAccount object) connected to the relevant Stripe
account](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/payouts). You now have
the option to set up an external account by specifying the financial account
`id`. You must also request the
[intra_stripe_flows](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/financial_accounts/object#financial_account_object-features-intra_stripe_flows)
feature on your Financial Account.

- **Platform accounts**: Use the Stripe Dashboard to create a `BankAccount`
object you can use for payouts from, or top-ups to, your platform account.
- **Connected accounts**: Use `POST
/v1/accounts/{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}/external_accounts` to specify the new
financial account `id` in the `financial_account` parameter to create a
`BankAccount` object you can use for payouts from a connected account

```
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts/acct_xxx/external_accounts \
 -u "sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:" \
 -d "external_account[country]"=us \
 -d "external_account[currency]"=usd \
 -d "external_account[financial_account]"=fa_xxx \
 -d "external_account[object]"=bank_account
```

Stripe returns the following:

```
{
 "id": "ba_xxx",
 ...
}
```

### Create a manual payout

After you set up your new Fifth Third financial account to have a bank account
`id`, call [POST /v1/payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payouts/create) to
specify the destination parameter value as the new bank account `id`.

```
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payouts \
 -u "sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:" \
 -d amount=1000 \
 -d currency=usd \
 -d destination=ba_xxx \
 -d method=instant
```

### Update an automatic payout setup

If you have connected accounts on your platform with an automatic payout
schedule, you can send payouts to their new Fifth Third financial account. Set
the `default_for_currency` parameter to `true` on the [external account you
created for the Fifth Third financial
account](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/payouts#financial-accounts-as-external-accounts).

### Payout reversals

You can create payout reversals for payouts into financial accounts with an
active ABA feature.

## Receive Transactions into the financial account

### Receive a credit from an existing FinancialAccount

To move funds from an existing financial account into a Fifth Third financial
account, create an
[OutboundTransfer](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/financial-accounts/out-of/outbound-transfers)
or
[OutboundPayment](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/financial-accounts/out-of/outbound-payments)
from the existing financial account. If you [enter a Fifth Third financial
account
ID](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/financial-accounts/out-of/outbound-payments#create-obp-for-fa)
in the `destination_payment_method_data` for an OutboundPayment, the transaction
is sent over the Stripe network.

```
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/treasury/outbound_transfers \
 -u "sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:" \
 -H "Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}" \
 -d financial_account=treasuryFinancialAccount \
 -d amount=1000 \
 -d currency=usd \
 -d "destination_payment_method_data[type]"=financial_account \
-d
"destination_payment_method_data[financial_account]"=destinationFifthThirdFinancialAccount
\
 -d "destination_payment_method_data[statement_descriptor]"="Test xfer" \
-d "destination_payment_method_data[description]"="OutboundTransfer to my Fifth
Third financial account"
```

### Receive a credit or debit from an external source

Fifth Third financial accounts receives externally addressable account and
routing numbers (VBAN) after you request and enable the
`financial_addresses.aba` feature. Your connected accounts can share the account
and routing numbers for their Fifth Third financial account to [received
credits](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/financial-accounts/into/received-credits)
(wire and ACH) and [received
debits](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/financial-accounts/out-of/received-debits)
(ACH) from external parties. They can also use microdeposits to authenticate
with the account.

Some external parties require a bank address to initiate a wire. Provide the
following address to your connected accounts to enable wires into Fifth Third
financial accounts:

38 Fountain Square Plaza Cincinnati, OH 45263

For now, you can only receive debits up to 500,000 USD per transaction. If an
external party originates a debit for an amount exceeding 500,000 USD, Stripe
originates a return with the R29 ACH return code. You won’t see any impact to
your balance, and the received debit won’t appear in your transaction list. When
we remove this limit, we’ll notify all platforms that have gone live with Fifth
Third and receive debits.

You can initiate reversals for debits by creating a
[DebitReversal](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/financial-accounts/out-of/debit-reversals).
You must create a DebitReversal within 24 hours; however, we’ll extend this
window in the coming months. Until we support
[CreditReversals](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/financial-accounts/into/credit-reversals),
email Stripe support to reverse a credit. We don’t currently support late
reversals.

## Issue cards on a Fifth Third financial account

Your
[Issuing](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/account-management/issuing-cards)
integration will remain unchanged, and you won’t need to reissue cards to your
users. You’ll have the ability to redirect existing cards from current financial
accounts to the new Fifth Third financial accounts without affecting users. This
is new functionality, and currently isn’t possible.

You can update your existing card to switch from being funded by an existing
financial account to a new Fifth Third financial account:

You can migrate a card by updating it with a new financial account ID:

```
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/issuing/cards/ic_xxx \
 -u "sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:" \
 -d financial_account=fa_xxx
```

Stripe returns the following response:

```
{
 "id": <card Id>,
 "object": "issuing.card",
 "financial_account": <new Financial Account Id>,
 ...
}
```

Authorizations remain associated with the same financial account, even if the
card is redirected to a different financial account. Any future card events
impact the original financial account’s balance. For example, incremental
authorization requests can occur up to 30 days later, depending on the spend
category. To avoid unintended declines while you migrate to Fifth Third, we
recommend partnering with Stripe on your migration.

You can also issue new cards that draw from a Fifth Third financial account by
specifying the new financial account ID when creating a card.

You can create a Fifth Third financial account and request the `card_issuing`
feature:

```
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/treasury/financial_accounts \
 -u "sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:" \
 -H "Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}" \
 -d "supported_currencies[]"=usd \
 -d "features[card_issuing][requested]"=true \
 -d "features[deposit_insurance][requested]"=true \
 -d "features[financial_addresses][aba][requested]"=false \
 -d "features[financial_addresses][aba][bank]"=fifth_third \
 -d "features[inbound_transfers][ach][requested]"=true \
 -d "features[intra_stripe_flows][requested]"=true \
 -d "features[outbound_payments][ach][requested]"=true \
 -d "features[outbound_payments][us_domestic_wire][requested]"=true \
 -d "features[outbound_transfers][ach][requested]"=true \
 -d "features[outbound_transfers][us_domestic_wire][requested]"=true
```

Stripe returns the following response:

```
{
 id: fa_123,
 ...
}
```

Next, create a new card specifying the Financial Account ID:

```
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/issuing/cards \
 -u "sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:" \
 -d financial_account=fa_xxx \
 -d currency=usd \
 -d type=virtual
```

## Complaints tracking

Your [complaints tracking
process](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/handling-complaints#complaints-tracking)
has one update. After your connected accounts start using Fifth Third Bank, the
`complaint_channel` field for each complaint includes the following new
channels:

- Employee
- Executive
- Filer On-Behalf Of
- Bancorp Incident
- Consumer Reporting Agency
- Fed
- CFPB
- BBB
- Board of Directors

No action is required until you receive an updated complaints tracker from
Stripe.

## Platform financial account

Your [platform’s financial
account](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/account-management/platform-financial-account)
remains open at Evolve. For now, we won’t open a second platform financial
account at Fifth Third Bank. However, we plan to introduce this option within a
few months. Until then, instantly transfer funds from your platform financial
account at Evolve to your connected accounts’ financial accounts at Fifth Third
Bank using Stripe network transfers.
