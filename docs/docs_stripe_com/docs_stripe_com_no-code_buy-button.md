# Create an embeddable buy button

## Use Payment Links to create an embeddable buy button for your website without using code.

Create an embeddable buy button to sell a product, subscription, or accept a
payment on your website. Start by selecting an existing link from the [Payment
Links list view](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payment-links) or by [creating a
new link](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payment-links/create) where you can
decide which products to sell and customize the checkout UI. After you create
your link, click **Buy button** to configure the buy button design and generate
the code that you can copy and paste into your website.

## Customize the button

By default, your buy button uses the same branding and call to action configured
for your payment link. You can:

- Choose between a simple button and a card widget.
- Set brand colors, shapes, and fonts to match your website.
- Set the language of the button and payment page to match your website’s
language.
- Customize your button’s call to action.
