  "content": "# Saving cards with the Charges API\n\n## Learn how to save and update card details to charge customers later.\n\n#### Legacy API\n\nThe content of this section refers to a Legacy feature. Use the [Payment Intents\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment) instead.\n\nThe Charges API doesn’t support the following features, many of which are\nrequired for credit card compliance:\n\n- Merchants in India\n- [Bank requests for card\nauthentication](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/cards/overview)\n- [Strong Customer\nAuthentication](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication)\n\nWhen you collect a customer’s payment information, a Stripe token is created.\nThis token can only be used once, but that doesn’t mean you have to request your\ncustomer’s card details for every payment.\n\nStripe provides a [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api#customer_object) object\nso you can save this—and other—information for later use. You can use `Customer`\nobjects for creating [subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing) or future\none-off charges.\n\n## Saving credit card details for later\n\nTo make a card available for later charging, including\n[subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating), create\na new `Customer` instead of a `Charge` by providing their email address and\ntokenized card information.\n\nBe certain to store the customer ID on your side for later use. You can\nsubsequently charge that customer by passing the customer ID—instead of a card\nrepresentation—in the charge request.\n\n```\n# Create a Customer:\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers \\\n -u sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2: \\\n -d source=tok_mastercard \\\n -d email=\"paying.user@example.com\"\n\n# Charge the Customer instead of the card:\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/charges \\\n -u sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2: \\\n -d amount=1000 \\\n -d currency=usd \\\n -d customer=cus_7sqFSKcBzzYEAf\n\n# YOUR CODE: Save the customer ID and other info in a database for later.\n\n# When it's time to charge the customer again, retrieve the customer ID.\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/charges \\\n -u sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2: \\\n -d amount=1500 \\\n -d currency=usd \\\n -d customer=cus_7sqFSKcBzzYEAf\n```\n\nCharges using saved card details can be customized in the same ways as [one-time\ncharges](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/charges-api).\n\n#### Note\n\n**Stripe typically validates card information when it is saved.** For more\ndetails on when this happens, see [Check if a card is valid without a\ncharge](https://support.stripe.com/questions/check-if-a-card-is-valid-without-a-charge).\nAs a result of this process, customers may see a [temporary\nauthorization](https://support.stripe.com/questions/why-does-my-customer-see-an-extra-1-00-charge-on-their-statement)\nfor a small charge in their local currency on their statement. This doesn’t\nguarantee that any future charges succeed (for example, the card no longer has\nsufficient funds, is reported lost or stolen, or if the account is closed). This\nprocess also updates the results of any checks, including traditional bank\nchecks by Radar (for example, CVC or postal code), that may have been performed.\n\n## Automatic card updates\n\nSaved payment method details can continue to work even if the issuing bank\nreplaces the physical card. Stripe works with card networks and automatically\nattempts to update saved card details whenever a customer receives a new card\n(for example, replacing an expired card or one that was reported lost or\nstolen). This allows your customers to continue using your service without\ninterruption and reduces the need for you to collect new card details whenever a\ncard is replaced.\n\nAutomatic card updates require card issuers to participate with the network and\nprovide this information. It’s widely supported in the United States, allowing\nStripe to automatically update most American Express, Visa, Mastercard, and\nDiscover cards issued there. International support varies from country to\ncountry. It isn’t possible to identify cards that support automatic updates.\n\nYou can listen for Stripe [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) to learn\nof card update activity:\n\n- The `payment_method.updated` event notifies you of updates to a card through\nan API call.\n- The `payment_method.automatically_updated` event notifies you of automatic\ncard updates from the network.\n\nThese events include the card’s new expiration date and last four digits, so you\ncan update your own records as needed. If the card update includes a new card\nnumber, the\n[fingerprint](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object#payment_method_object-card-fingerprint)\nchanges.\n\n## Changing the default payment method\n\nAlthough many of the cards you save can be automatically updated, you should\nstill adopt a process that allows customers to update or replace the cards on\nfile (for example, a customer wants to change the card being billed or their\ncard can’t be automatically updated). The end of the process requires an [update\ncustomer](https://docs.stripe.com/api#update_customer) call, providing a new\ntoken for the `source` parameter.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers/cus_V9T7vofUbZMqpv \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d source=tok_visa\n```\n\nThis sets the new card as the default payment method for future payments. It\nalso deletes the previously saved card.\n\n## Multiple payment methods\n\n[Customers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers) can also store multiple\npayment methods. The first one saved to a customer is set as the\n`default_source`. This is used for subscription payments and whenever a charge\nrequest is made with just a customer ID.\n\nYou can manage the payment methods saved to a customer (for example,\n[create](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_card) or\n[remove](https://docs.stripe.com/api#delete_card) cards) and you can\n[update](https://docs.stripe.com/api#update_customer) the customer to change\n`default_source` to another stored payment method at any time.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Guide to Payment Methods](https://stripe.com/payments/payment-methods-guide)\n- [Creating Charges](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/charges-api)\n- [Billing](https://docs.stripe.com/billing)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Payment Intents API](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment)\n- [Bank requests for card\nauthentication](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/cards/overview)\n- [Strong Customer\nAuthentication](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication)\n- [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api#customer_object)\n- [subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing)\n- [save and reuse\ncards](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/more-payment-scenarios)\n- [subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating)\n- [one-time charges](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/charges-api)\n- [Check if a card is valid without a\ncharge](https://support.stripe.com/questions/check-if-a-card-is-valid-without-a-charge)\n- [temporary\nauthorization](https://support.stripe.com/questions/why-does-my-customer-see-an-extra-1-00-charge-on-their-statement)\n- [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks)\n-\n[fingerprint](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object#payment_method_object-card-fingerprint)\n- [update](https://docs.stripe.com/api#update_card)\n- [update customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api#update_customer)\n- [Customers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers)\n- [create](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_card)\n- [remove](https://docs.stripe.com/api#delete_card)\n- [Guide to Payment Methods](https://stripe.com/payments/payment-methods-guide)",
