# Charges now specify the ID for the rule blocking a transaction, which can be expandedBreaking changes

## What’s new

Updates the `outcome[rule]` property on the `Charge` object to contain the ID of
the rule that blocked the charge. Previously, `outcome[rule]` contained the
entire `Rule` object. You can [expand this
property](https://docs.stripe.com/api#expanding_objects) when retrieving charges
to render the full `Rule` object as before.

## Impact

The `Charge` object `outcome[rule]` and `dispute` properties now contain IDs
instead of full objects, supporting expandable fields.
