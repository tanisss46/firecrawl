Click the links above to learn about the thresholds\nfor tax collection in each location.\n\nSee [Thresholds](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/thresholds) to get insights\nabout your potential tax registration obligations in each location. Stripe only\nmonitors if you have reached a tax threshold for sales outside of the country\nyour business is based in. Stripe also notifies you with email and Dashboard\nalerts when you need to register to collect tax. Learn more about how the\n[monitoring tool works](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/monitoring).\n\nStripe can collect tax if your business is based in Australia, Hong Kong, Japan,\nNew Zealand and Singapore. Your business needs to be a remote seller with no\nphysical presence (such as a shop or warehouse) to collect tax on Stripe in the\nother countries listed above.\n\nAfter you’ve registered with a country, go to\n[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations) to add your\nregistrations to Stripe in the Dashboard to start collecting tax on your\ntransactions in that location.\n\n## How we calculate taxes\n\nStripe can calculate tax for [any of the product tax codes you assign to your\nproducts](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes) and for domestic and\ncross-border sales in Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, New Zealand and Singapore.\nFor the other countries listed, Stripe only supports calculation for [digital\nproducts](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes?type=digital) sold by remote\nsellers.\n\n### Domestic transactions\n\nA transaction where your business and your customer are in the same country is\ncalled a domestic transaction. Stripe assumes the sale of most goods or services\nto be taxable unless the tax authority has specifically made them exempt.\n\n### Cross border transactions\n\nA cross-border transaction is where your customer is located in a different\ncountry to your business or when goods are shipped from one country to another.\n\nStripe calculates tax on a cross-border transaction taking into account the\nfollowing factors:\n\n- the location of your business\n- the tax registrations you’ve added to Stripe\n- the location of the buyer\n- the type of the product sold (based on which [product tax\ncode](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes) you assigned to your product)\n- the status of the customer (whether they’re an individual or a business)\n\n#### Digital products\n\nDigital products are non-physical items or services that are delivered, given,\nor rendered electronically. This includes digital goods and electronically\nsupplied services. We determine whether you’re selling digital products or\nphysical goods using the [product tax\ncode](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes) you assigned to your product.\n\nDigital products are generally taxable in the country where your customer is\nlocated. However sales of digital products to businesses in other countries\nmight have reverse charge applied. With reverse charge, your business provides\nan invoice for the purchase so that your customer can calculate the tax.\n\n#### Physical goods\n\nWhen physical goods are shipped to a customer in a different country to your\nbusiness, the transaction is referred to as an export. Exports are zero rated\nand Stripe applies the [zero rate](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/zero-tax). The\ntransaction might still be subject to taxes and customs duties in the country\nyour customer is in. Stripe doesn’t calculate these.\n\n## Report and file your taxes\n\nStripe provides reports of your completed tax transactions. Go to\n[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations) to access these\nreports. Learn more about [the different types of\nreports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports).\n\nYou’re responsible for filing and remitting your taxes. Stripe doesn’t file\ntaxes on your behalf.\n\n## Links\n\n-\n[Armenia](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/asia-pacific/armenia)\n-\n[Australia](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/asia-pacific/australia)\n-\n[Bahrain](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/asia-pacific/bahrain)\n-\n[Cambodia](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/asia-pacific/cambodia)\n-\n[Georgia](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/asia-pacific/georgia)\n- [Hong\nKong](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/asia-pacific/hong-kong)\n-\n[Indonesia](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/asia-pacific/indonesia)\n- [Japan](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/asia-pacific/japan)\n-\n[Kazakhstan](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/asia-pacific/kazakhstan)\n-\n[Malaysia](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/asia-pacific/malaysia)\n- [Nepal](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/asia-pacific/nepal)\n- [New\nZealand](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/asia-pacific/new-zealand)\n- [Oman](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/asia-pacific/oman)\n- [Saudi\nArabia](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/asia-pacific/saudi-arabia)\n-\n[Singapore](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/asia-pacific/singapore)\n- [South\nKorea](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/asia-pacific/south-korea)\n-\n[Tajikistan](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/asia-pacific/tajikistan)\n-\n[Thailand](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/asia-pacific/thailand)\n-\n[Türkiye](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/asia-pacific/turkiye)\n- [United Arab\nEmirates](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/asia-pacific/united-arab-emirates)\n-\n[Uzbekistan](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/asia-pacific/uzbekistan)\n-\n[Vietnam](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/asia-pacific/vietnam)\n- [Thresholds](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/thresholds)\n- [monitoring tool works](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/monitoring)\n- [Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations)\n- [any of the product tax codes you assign to your\nproducts](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes)\n- [digital products](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes?type=digital)\n- [zero rate](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/zero-tax)\n- [the different types of reports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports)",
