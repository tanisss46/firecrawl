Your\ncustomers can save their credit cards, debit cards, or US bank accounts for\nfaster checkout at any Link-enabled business. Link also lets you accept [Instant\nBank Payments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/instant-bank-payments). All\nLink transactions confirm immediately, and successful payments settle to your\nStripe balance on the same timeline as card payments, regardless of the payment\nmethod that funds the payment.\n\nCustomers can make changes to their account, view their purchase history, or\nreach out to the Link customer support team by visiting\n[link.com](https://www.link.com/). For information about how your payment\nintegration affects Link, see [Link in different payment\nintegrations](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/link-payment-integrations).\n\nPayment method propertiesBusiness locationsProduct support- **Customer\nlocations**\n\nWorldwide except India\n- **Presentment currency**\n\nSee [supported presentment\ncurrencies](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#presentment-currencies)\n- **Payment confirmation**\n\nCustomer-initiated\n- **Payment method family**\n\nWallet\n- **Recurring payments**\n\nYes\n- **Payout timing**\n\nStandard payout timing applies\n- **Connect support**\n\nYes\n- **Dispute support**\n\n[Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/wallets/link#disputes)\n- **Manual capture support**\n\nYes\n- **Refunds or partial refunds**\n\n[Yes and Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/wallets/link#refunds)\n\n## Payment flow\n\nThe Link payment flow varies depending on the Stripe product that you’re using.\nTo learn more, see [Faster checkout with\nlink](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link).\n\n## Get started\n\nFor eligible transactions, Stripe automatically displays Link when it’s enabled\nunder **Wallets** in your [payment method\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods). All Link\ntransactions confirm immediately, and successful payments settle to your Stripe\nbalance on the same timeline as card payments, regardless of the payment method\nthat funds the payment.\n\nYou can integrate Link in two ways: as a payment method, or by incorporating it\ninto a card-specific integration. Stripe recommends using Link as a payment\nmethod, because it’s a simpler integration and works with [dynamic payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/dynamic-payment-methods)\nout of the box. However, if you only accept card payments, or you require access\nto card details such as the brand or last 4 digits, add Link to your card\nintegration.\n\nBoth Link integrations accept all types of payment methods supported by Link,\nincluding credit cards, debit cards, and [Instant Bank\nPayments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/instant-bank-payments).\n\nIf you integrate [Link as a payment\nmethod](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/link-payment-integrations?link-integrations=link-payment-method),\nthen each Link transaction has a [PaymentMethod\nobject](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object) with a\n[type](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object#payment_method_object-type)\nof `link` and no `wallet` hash.\n\nIf you incorporate [Link into a card-specific\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/link-payment-integrations?link-integrations=link-card-integrations),\nthen each Link transaction has a [PaymentMethod\nobject](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object) with a\n[type](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object#payment_method_object-type)\nof `card` and a `card.wallet` hash with a\n[type](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object#payment_method_object-card-wallet-type)\nof `link`.\n\n## Refunds\n\nLink supports full and partial refunds. You can initiate refunds through the\nStripe Dashboard or API, similar to other payment methods. The refund process is\ntypically completed within 5-10 business days, depending on your bank.\n\n## Disputes\n\n[Disputes](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes) for Link payments follow a similar\nprocess to card disputes. You can respond to disputes through the Stripe\nDashboard or API. The dispute process and timelines might vary, depending on\nwhether the saved payment method used for the transaction was a card or bank\naccount.\n\n#### Note\n\nIf you prefer to handle disputes programmatically, you can [respond to\ndisputes](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/api) using the API.\n\n## Supported currencies\n\nLink supports all [currencies](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies) that Stripe\nsupports for card payments.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Link with Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/checkout-link)\n- [Link with Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/elements-link)\n- [Link with Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/invoicing)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Link](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link)\n- [Instant Bank\nPayments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/instant-bank-payments)\n- [link.com](https://www.link.com)\n- [Link in different payment\nintegrations](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/link-payment-integrations)\n- [supported presentment\ncurrencies](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#presentment-currencies)\n- [payment method\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods)\n- [dynamic payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/dynamic-payment-methods)\n- [Link as a payment\nmethod](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/link-payment-integrations?link-integrations=link-payment-method)\n- [PaymentMethod object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object)\n-\n[type](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object#payment_method_object-type)\n- [Link into a card-specific\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/link-payment-integrations?link-integrations=link-card-integrations)\n-\n[type](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object#payment_method_object-card-wallet-type)\n- [Disputes](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes)\n- [respond to disputes](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/api)\n- [currencies](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies)\n- [Link with Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/checkout-link)\n- [Link with Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/elements-link)\n- [Link with Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/invoicing)",
