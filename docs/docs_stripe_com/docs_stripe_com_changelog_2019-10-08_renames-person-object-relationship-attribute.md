# Renames a Person object relationship attributeBreaking changes

## What’s new

Renames the `relationship[account_opener]` field to
`relationship[representative]` on a `Person` object.

## Impact

Lets you more accurately and intuitively identify the person who is designated
as the representative for an account. By renaming the
`relationship[account_opener] `field to `relationship[representative]`, the
terminology better reflects the role and purpose of this person within the
account.
