# Custom Canadian pre-authorized debit mandate agreements

#### Caution

It is unlikely your business needs to create a custom mandate agreement. By
default, the Stripe.js library provides an all-in-one solution for your
customers to provide and verify their bank account and accept a valid mandate.

## Do you need a custom mandate agreement?

Here are some reasons *not to* create a custom mandate agreement:

- You want to send customized emails
- You want to specify custom payment schedule terms

It is possible to send customized emails using the same mandate agreement text
provided in the customer payment details collection solution. Simply match the
same text provided by Stripe in your own emails.

If you want to specify a custom payment schedule, this can be done using the
Stripe API. The mandate agreement automatically displayed to your customers will
use the payment schedule terms you provide.

Here are some reasons you might want to create a custom mandate agreement:

- You want to obtain authorization from your customer to not send debit
notification emails
- You want to provide different or additional cancellation or recourse terms
that satisfy [Payments Canada
rules](https://www.payments.ca/sites/default/files/h1eng.pdf)

The mandate agreement provided by default is specifically written to serve the
needs of almost all businesses on Stripe. It uses the most flexible timelines
for confirmation and cancellation allowed by Canadian banks and satisfies all
requirements given by the [Payments Canada Rules for pre-authorized
debits](https://www.payments.ca/sites/default/files/h1eng.pdf). Though there are
very few reasons to create a custom agreement, not all businesses are the same.
This page will help your business create a valid mandate agreement that will
protect both you and your customers.

## Background

In addition to collecting a customer’s name and bank account information, you
must collect specific debit mandate (often called a pre-authorized debit
agreement). This mandate gives your business authorization to debit the
customer’s bank account on a specified schedule. Your business must present and
collect a mandate agreement with clear and specific terms for one-time or
recurring debits that meets the requirements given by the [Payments Canada
rules](https://www.payments.ca/sites/default/files/h1eng.pdf).

Parts of the agreement will be pre-defined based on the mandate you create [with
the Stripe
API](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/acss-debit/accept-a-payment#web-create-payment-intent)
(for example the `interval_description` defining your payment timeline or
triggers) and existing information about your customers. This page will guide
you through the remaining required parts of a mandate agreement, but your
business will ultimately be responsible for any disputes arising from its
contents.

After your customer accepts the mandate agreement, you can immediately debit the
first payment due from your customer’s account. You must send your customer
confirmation of the accepted mandate agreement, including collected payment
details. The mandate agreement must include terms that allow you to immediately
debit the bank account and send the confirmation within 5 days after your
customer has accepted the mandate agreement. By default, Stripe sends a
[customizable agreement confirmation
email](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/acss-debit#mandate-and-debit-notification-emails)
matching the [sample
below](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/acss-debit/custom-pad-agreement#sample-pre-authorized-debit-agreement).

Pre-debit notification emails informing your customer that a charge is being
made and the amount of the charge is a requirement, as well. However, the time
limit for these can be modified or they can be waived entirely in the agreement.

## Mandate agreement requirements

A properly formatted PAD mandate agreement must include the following
information in order to meet regulatory requirements:

RequirementDescriptionExample Text
Business Contact Information

The mandate agreement must contain accurate contact information that the
customer can use to contact your business by a method of communication your
customer uses.

`payment_schedule` is `interval` or `combined`.

The mandate agreement must display the
[Mandate](https://docs.stripe.com/api/mandates) `interval_description` value,
which should contain an explicit schedule of payments or triggering events for
debits.

- On the 5th of every month or the next business day.

Sporadic Authorization

Required only if [Mandate](https://docs.stripe.com/api/mandates)
`payment_schedule` is `sporadic` or `combined`.

The mandate agreement must state that your business will obtain authorization
(such as providing a username and password) from your customer for each sporadic
payment you process.

*Rocket Rides* may debit the specified account for sporadic payments only after
obtaining your authorization.

Modification of PAD Confirmation PeriodIn order to improve the speed with which
you can do business, Stripe performs verification on customer bank accounts that
allows your business to begin debiting after a PAD is accepted so long as the
Customer has agreed to this in the mandate agreement.You agree that any payment
due will be debited from your account immediately upon acceptance of this PAD
agreement and that confirmation of this PAD agreement will be sent within five
calendar days after acceptance.
Modification of Pre-Notification Period

Stripe supports the ability to send required pre-debit notification emails to
your customer (or provide webhooks that notify you to send them) when debits are
initiated. Your customer must agree to waive the pre-notification period. This
text must be bolded, highlighted or underlined in the mandate agreement text.

Pre-notifications are required if not expressly waived. If you opt out of
sending these emails, the text for waiving the pre-notification must be included
instead, also bolded, highlighted or underlined.

- **You waive the right to receive pre-notification and prior confirmation of
the amount or timing of any PAD.**
- **You additionally agree that you don’t require advance notice of the amount
or timing of any PAD before Rocket Rides processes the debit.**
