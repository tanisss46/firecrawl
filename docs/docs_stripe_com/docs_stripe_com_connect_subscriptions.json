  "content": "# Create subscriptions with Stripe Billing\n\n## With Connect, you can create subscriptions for your customers or connected accounts.\n\nSoftware as a Service (SaaS) and marketplace businesses use Stripe Connect to\nroute payments between themselves, customers, and connected accounts. You can\nuse Connect to route payments or [payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts) and\nuse Stripe Billing to support your recurring revenue model.\n\n## Use cases\n\nYou can create\n[subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview) for\nconnect accounts, which supports several approaches for collecting payments. You\ncan create subscriptions for your connected account’s customers using direct or\ndestination charges, for your end customers to directly transact with your\nplatform, and to charge your connected accounts a fee for using your platform.\n\nCustomerPlatformConnected account\nThe following use cases describe how to use Stripe Billing to create\nsubscriptions from end customers to connected accounts, to bill platform end\ncustomers, and to bill connected accounts.\n\nUse caseDescription[Create subscriptions from the end customer to the connected\naccount](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/subscriptions#customer-connected-account)Create\nsubscriptions for end customers to your connected accounts, which supports\nseveral approaches for collecting payments. In this example,\n[Prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices) reside on the connected\naccount.[Create subscriptions to bill platform end\ncustomers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/subscriptions#customer-platform)Marketplaces\ncan directly offer membership subscriptions without involving your connected\naccount. In this example, [Prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices) reside on\nthe platform.[Create subscriptions to bill connected\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/subscriptions#connected-account-platform)Platforms\ncan create subscriptions for their connected accounts. In this example,\n[Prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices) reside on the platform.\n### Restrictions\n\nUsing subscriptions with Connect has these restrictions:\n\n- Your platform can’t update or cancel a subscription that it didn’t create.\n- Your platform can’t add an `application_fee_amount` to an invoice that it\ndidn’t create, nor to an invoice that contains invoice items the platform didn’t\ncreate.\n- Subscriptions aren’t automatically cancelled when you disconnect from the\nplatform. You must cancel the subscription after disconnection. You can use\n[webhooks to monitor connected account\nactivity](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/webhooks).\n\n## Create subscriptions from the end customer to the connected account\n\nIf you’re building a platform, you can create subscriptions for your connected\naccounts’ customers, optionally taking a per-payment fee for your platform.\n\nCustomerPlatformConnected account\nThis example builds an online publishing platform that allows customers to\nsubscribe to their favorite authors and pay them a monthly fee to receive\npremium blog posts from each author.\n\n## Before you begin\n\nBefore you can create subscriptions for your customers or connected accounts,\nyou must:\n\n- Create a [connected account](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/accounts) for\neach person that receives money on your platform. In our online publishing\nexample, a connected account represents an author.\n- Create a pricing model. For this example, we create a flat-rate [pricing\nmodel](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models#flat-rate) to\ncharge customers a fee on a recurring basis, but per-seat and usage-based\npricing are also supported.\n- Create a [customer with the intended payment\nmethod](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer#manage-customers) for each\nperson that subscribes to a connected account. In our online publishing example,\nyou create a customer for each reader that subscribes to an author.\n\n### Decide between direct charges and destination charges\n\nYou can use either direct charges or destination charges to split a customer’s\npayment between the connected account and your platform.\n\nWith direct charges, customers won’t be aware of your platform’s existence\nbecause the author’s name, rather than your platform’s name, is shown on the\nstatement descriptor. In our online publishing example, readers interact with\nauthors directly.\n\nDirect charges are recommended for connected accounts with access to the full\nStripe Dashboard, which includes Standard accounts.\n\nIf you want your platform to be responsible for Stripe fees, refunds, and\nchargebacks, use destination charges. In our online publishing example,\ncustomers subscribe to your publishing platform, not directly with specific\nauthors.\n\nDestination charges are recommended for connected accounts with access to the\nExpress Dashboard or connected accounts without access to a Stripe-hosted\ndashboard, which includes Express and Custom accounts.\n\nFor more information about the different types of Connect charges, see [Charge\ntypes](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges#types).\n\n### Use direct charges to create a subscription\n\nTo create a subscription with\n[Charges](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object) associated to the\nconnected account, [create a\nsubscription](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_subscription) while\n[authenticated as the connected\naccount](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/authentication#stripe-account-header).\nMake sure to define the customer with a default payment method and the\n[Price](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices) on the connected account. To use a\ncustomer without a default payment method, set `payment_behavior:\n\"default_incomplete\"`. Learn more about [payment\nbehavior](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/create#create_subscription-payment_behavior).\n\nExpand `latest_invoice.payment_intent` to include the Payment Element, which is\nneeded to confirm the payment. Learn more about [Payment\nElements](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/build-subscriptions?ui=elements#add-the-payment-element-to-your-page).\n\nFor an end-to-end example of how to implement a subscription signup and payment\nflow in your application, see the [subscriptions\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/build-subscriptions)\nguide.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscriptions \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -H \"Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}\" \\\n -d customer={{CUSTOMER_ID}} \\\n -d \"items[0][price]\"={{PRICE_ID}} \\\n -d \"expand[0]\"=\"latest_invoice.payment_intent\"\n```\n\n### Use destination charges to create a subscription\n\nTo create a subscription with\n[Charges](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object) associated to the platform\nand automatically create transfers to a connected account, make a [create\nsubscription](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_subscription) call while\nproviding the connected account ID as the `transfer_data[destination]`\n[value](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-transfer_data).\n\nExpand `latest_invoice.payment_intent` to include the Payment Element, which you\nneed to confirm the payment. Learn more about [Payment\nElements](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/build-subscriptions?ui=elements#add-the-payment-element-to-your-page).\n\nYou can optionally specify an\n[application_fee_percent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-application_fee_percent).\nLearn more about [collecting\nfees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/subscriptions#collect-fees).\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscriptions \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d customer={{CUSTOMER_ID}} \\\n -d \"items[0][price]\"={{PRICE_ID}} \\\n -d \"expand[0]\"=\"latest_invoice.payment_intent\" \\\n -d \"transfer_data[destination]\"={{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}\n```\n\n### Additional steps before you create a subscription\n\nTo create a destination charge, define both the customer and the price on the\nplatform account. You must have created a connected account on the platform. The\ncustomer must exist within the platform account. When using destination charges,\nthe platform is the merchant of record.\n\n## Create subscriptions to bill platform end customers\n\nYou can use Stripe Billing to create subscriptions for your end customers to\ndirectly transact with your platform without involving your connected accounts.\n\nCustomerPlatformConnected account\nThis example builds a marketplace that allows customers to order on-demand\ndelivery from restaurants. This marketplace offers customers a premium monthly\nsubscription that waives their delivery fees. Customers who subscribe to the\npremium offering pay the marketplace directly and don’t subscribe to any\nparticular delivery service or restaurant.\n\n## Before you begin\n\nBefore you create subscriptions for your customers, you must:\n\n- Create a pricing model. For this example, we create a flat-rate [pricing\nmodel](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models#flat-rate) to\ncharge customers a fee on a recurring basis, but per-seat and usage-based\npricing are also supported.\n- Create a [customer](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer#manage-customers)\nrecord for every customer you want to bill.\n\nYou can also create a [connected\naccount](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/accounts) for each user that receives\nmoney from your marketplace. In our on-demand restaurant delivery example, a\nconnected account is a restaurant or a delivery service. However, this step\nisn’t required for customers to subscribe to your marketplace directly.\n\n### Create a subscription\n\nTo create a subscription where your platform receives the funds, without any\nmoney going to connected accounts, follow the [Subscriptions\nguide](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/build-subscriptions) to\ncreate a subscription with Stripe Billing.\n\n### Create separate charges and transfers\n\nIf you want to manually transfer a portion of the funds that your platform\nreceives to your connected accounts later, use [separate charges and\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers) to\npay out funds to one or more connected accounts. In our on-demand restaurant\ndelivery example, you can use separate charges and transfers to pay out an\naffiliate fee to a delivery driver or restaurant who refers a customer to\nsubscribe to the premium delivery service.\n\n## Create subscriptions to bill connected accounts\n\nYou can use Stripe Billing to create subscriptions to charge your connected\naccounts a fee for using your platform.\n\nCustomerPlatformConnected account\nThis example builds a gym management software platform that allows gym\nbusinesses to pay a monthly fee to use the software to manage scheduling and\nappointments for classes. The gym businesses pay the subscription fee, not the\ngym patrons.\n\nThe gym management software also facilitates one-time payments between the gym\npatron and gym business for each class that the gym patron enrolls in. The\nmonthly subscription is between the connected account and the platform, which\ndoesn’t involve the gym patron in the transaction.\n\nIn the diagram above, the gym business is the connected account and the gym\npatron is the end customer.\n\n## Before you begin\n\nBefore you create subscriptions for your customers or connected accounts, you\nmust:\n\n- Create a [connected account](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/accounts) for\neach user that receives money on your platform. In this example, the connected\naccount is the gym business.\n- Create a pricing model. For this example, we create a flat-rate [pricing\nmodel](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models#flat-rate) to\ncharge customers a fee on a recurring basis, but per-seat and usage-based\npricing are also supported.\n- Create a [customer](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer#manage-customers)\non the platform with the intended payment method for every connected account you\nwant to bill. In the gym management software example, you create a customer for\neach gym business:\n\n### Create a Customer object to represent the connected account\n\nIf your connected accounts use Stripe to process payments for their end\ncustomers, they might have already created a\n[Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers) object for each end customer.\n\nTo successfully create a subscription for the connected account to pay a\nrecurring fee to the platform, you must create a separate\n[Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers) object to represent the\nconnected account.\n\nIn the gym example, the gym business uses Stripe to process one-time payments\nfor its gym patrons. They already created a Customer object for each gym patron,\nbut you need to create a different Customer object to represent the gym business\nitself. Create only one Customer to represent each business entity and don’t\ncreate a Customer to represent each owner, manager, or operator of the business.\n\n### Create a subscription for the connected account\n\nTo create a subscription where your platform receives the funds from your\nconnected accounts, follow the [Subscriptions\nguide](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/build-subscriptions) to\ncreate a subscription with Stripe Billing. The Customer object involved in the\ntransaction represents the connected account, not the end customer. In our gym\nexample, the `CUSTOMER_ID` represents the gym business, not the gym patron.\n\n## Enable your integration to receive event notifications\n\nStripe creates event notifications when changes happen in your account, like\nwhen a recurring payment succeeds or when a payout fails. To receive these\nnotifications and use them to automate your integration, set up a\n[webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) endpoint. For example, you could\nprovision access to your service when you receive the `invoice.paid` event.\n\n### Event notifications for Connect and subscriptions integrations\n\nHere are the event notifications that Connect integrations typically use.\n\nEventdata.object\ntypeDescription`account.application.deauthorized``application`Occurs when a\nconnected account disconnects from your platform. You can use it to trigger\ncleanup on your server.
