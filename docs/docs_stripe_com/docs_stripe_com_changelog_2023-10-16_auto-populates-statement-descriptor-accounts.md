# Auto-populates the statement descriptor and prefix in the Accounts API Breaking changes

## What’s new

In priority order, automatically sets the statement descriptor (when unset), to
the first of the following supplied parameters:

- `business_profile.name`
- `business_profile.url`
- `company.name` or `individual.first_name` and `individual.last_name`
(dependent on the `business_type`)

## Impact

The statement descriptor is only set automatically when you provide one of these
fields as a parameter, so existing accounts aren’t impacted unless a dependent
field is updated. Similarly,
`settings.card_payments.statement_descriptor_prefix` now defaults to a shortened
version of the `settings.payments.statement_descriptor`. This takes place
whenever the statement descriptor is updated (either explicitly or when
defaulted).
