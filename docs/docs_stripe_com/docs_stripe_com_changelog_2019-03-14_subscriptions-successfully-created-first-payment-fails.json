  "content": "# Subscriptions are now successfully created even if the first payment failsBreaking changes\n\n## What’s new\n\nCreating a subscription succeeds even when the first payment fails. The\nsubscription is created in an incomplete status, where it remains for up to 23\nhours. During that time period, it can be moved into an active state by paying\nthe first invoice. If no successful payment is made, the subscription moves into\na final `incomplete_expired` state. Updates to a `non-incomplete` subscription\nthat require a payment also succeed regardless of the payment status. Before\ntjhis version, all creations or updates would fail if the corresponding payment\nfailed. For more details, see our guide on the [subscription\nlifecycle](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview#subscription-lifecycle).\n\n## Impact\n\nThis change allows you to create subscriptions even when the initial payment\nfails, introducing an `incomplete` status that lasts up to 23 hours. This gives\nyour users a grace period to resolve payment issues before a subscription\nbecomes `incomplete_expired`.\n\n## Upgrade\n\n- [View your current API\nversion](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#view-your-api-version-and-the-latest-available-upgrade-in-workbench)\nin Workbench.\n- If you use an SDK, upgrade to the corresponding SDK version for this API\nversion.- If you don’t use an SDK, update your [API\nrequests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/versioning) to include `Stripe-Version:\n2019-03-14`\n- Upgrade the API version used for [webhook\nendpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks/versioning).\n- [Test your integration](https://docs.stripe.com/testing) against the new\nversion.\n- If you use Connect, [test your Connect\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/testing).\n- In Workbench, [perform the\nupgrade](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#perform-the-upgrade).
