The\nconnector uses the data generated in your Stripe account to create an equivalent\nrecord in NetSuite.\n\n### Security\n\nThe connector uses HTTPS to [securely](https://docs.stripe.com/security)\ncommunicate with NetSuite, and the latest version of TLS supported by NetSuite.\nNo unauthenticated data is passed to NetSuite or any other system. In addition,\nthe connector uses Stripe components for payment collection and [SCA\ncompliance](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication/sca-enforcement).\n\n### Testing\n\nThe connector includes an automated testing system that runs daily tests on\nevery NetSuite feature and use case. You can connect your Stripe test\nenvironment to your NetSuite release preview to verify that the connector\nfunctions properly with the latest NetSuite release and your other integrations.\n\n### Developer workflow\n\n[Stripe payment processing in NetSuiteReconcile Stripe payments from third-party\nor homegrown systems into\nNetSuite.](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/netsuite/custom-payment-application)[Field\nmappingConfigure the fields and records that you want to map between Stripe and\nNetSuite.](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/netsuite/field-mappings)[Stripe\nand NetSuite field referencesLearn about how the connector correlates Stripe\nrecords with NetSuite\nrecords.](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/netsuite/fields-references)[Real-time\neventsSync your data from Stripe to NetSuite, and learn about how the connector\nhandles webhook\nevents.](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/netsuite/sync-data)[Error resolution\nguideIdentify and resolve errors with the connector and errors syncing records\nfrom Stripe to\nNetSuite.](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/netsuite/error-resolution)\n\n## Links\n\n- [securely](https://docs.stripe.com/security)\n- [SCA\ncompliance](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication/sca-enforcement)\n- [Stripe payment processing in NetSuiteReconcile Stripe payments from\nthird-party or homegrown systems into\nNetSuite.](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/netsuite/custom-payment-application)\n- [Field mappingConfigure the fields and records that you want to map between\nStripe and\nNetSuite.](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/netsuite/field-mappings)\n- [Stripe and NetSuite field referencesLearn about how the connector correlates\nStripe records with NetSuite\nrecords.](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/netsuite/fields-references)\n- [Real-time eventsSync your data from Stripe to NetSuite, and learn about how\nthe connector handles webhook\nevents.](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/netsuite/sync-data)\n- [Error resolution guideIdentify and resolve errors with the connector and\nerrors syncing records from Stripe to\nNetSuite.](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/netsuite/error-resolution)",
