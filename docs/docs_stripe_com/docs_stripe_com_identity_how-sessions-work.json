We\nrecommend creating the VerificationSession right before the start of the\nverification flow.\n\nprocessing\nAs soon as the user submits the session, the VerificationSession moves to\n`processing`. Most [verification\nchecks](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-checks) are processed in\nless than 1 minute.\n\nverified\nA VerificationSession with a status of `verified` means that the verification\nflow is complete. Processing of all the verification checks are complete and\nsuccessfully verified.\n\nrequires_input\nIf any of the verification checks fail (for example, because of a manipulated\ndocument), the VerificationSession’s status returns to `requires_input`. You can\nfind an explanation for the verification failure in the `last_error` field of\nthe session. If you want your user to attempt verification again, you need to\n[Retrieve the\nVerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions/retrieve)\nto get a fresh URL or client secret. Details provided by the `provided_details`\nfield might be shown to your user.\n\ncanceled\nYou may [cancel a\nVerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#cancel)\nat any point before it’s `processing` or `verified`. This invalidates the\nVerificationSession for future submission attempts, and can’t be undone.\n\n## Session events\n\n[Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events) are created every time a session\nchanges status. Here’s a complete list of the VerificationSession [event\ntypes](https://docs.stripe.com/api#event_types):\n\nEvent typeDescription`identity.verification_session.created`The session was\n[created](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#create).`identity.verification_session.processing`The\nuser has successfully submitted their information, and verification checks have\nstarted processing.`identity.verification_session.verified`Processing of all the\n[verification checks](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-checks) have\ncompleted, and they’re all successfully\nverified.`identity.verification_session.requires_input`Processing of all the\n[verification checks](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-checks) have\ncompleted, and at least one of the checks\nfailed.`identity.verification_session.canceled`The session has been canceled and\nfuture submission attempts have been disabled. This event is sent when a session\nis [canceled](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#cancel) or\n[redacted](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#redact).`identity.verification_session.redacted`The\nsession was\n[redacted](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#redact). You\nmust create a [webhook endpoint](https://docs.stripe.com/api/webhook_endpoints)\nwhich explicitly subscribes to this event type to access it. Webhook endpoints\nwhich subscribe to all events will not include this event type.\nYou might want to take action in response to certain events, such as emailing\nyour user when a verification fails or succeeds.\n\nStripe recommends that you listen for events with\n[webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/handle-verification-outcomes).\n\n## See also\n\n- [The Verification Sessions\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions)\n- [Handle verification\noutcomes](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/handle-verification-outcomes)\n\n## Links\n\n- [VerificationSessions](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions)\n- [begin the verification\nprocess](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verify-identity-documents)\n- [verification checks](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-checks)\n- [Retrieve the\nVerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions/retrieve)\n- [cancel a\nVerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#cancel)\n- [Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events)\n- [event types](https://docs.stripe.com/api#event_types)\n- [created](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#create)\n- [redacted](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#redact)\n- [webhook endpoint](https://docs.stripe.com/api/webhook_endpoints)\n- [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/handle-verification-outcomes)",
