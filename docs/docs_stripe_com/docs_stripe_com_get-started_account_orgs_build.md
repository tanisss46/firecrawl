# Build an OrganizationPublic preview

## Select accounts to combine into an organization.

Create an organization and manage your accounts and your teams from a single
location in the Stripe Dashboard.

## Prerequisites

You must complete the following prerequisites before you can create an
organization:

- The individual responsible for creating the organization must be assigned to
the [Super Administrator
role](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/teams/roles) in each account
that’s added to the organization. Stripe automatically assigns the Super
Administrator role to the owner of the account. If your account owner has left
your company, you can [request an ownership
transfer](https://support.stripe.com/questions/change-the-owner-of-a-stripe-account).
- If your accounts are configured to use single sign-on (SSO), make sure that
all your accounts share the same SSO integration. If two accounts have different
SSO configurations, you must update one of the SSO configurations to match the
other.

## Create an organization

To create an organization from one of your Stripe accounts:

- Navigate to your [Account
details](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/account) settings in the
Dashboard.
- Click **Create organization**.
- Enter your **Organization name**.
- Select the accounts you want to add to the organization. You can add up to 75
accounts.
- Agree to the [Terms of Service](https://stripe.com/legal/organizations).
- Click **Create**.

## Add an existing account to an organization

After you create an organization, you can add an existing account. An
organization can include up to 75 accounts, and an account can belong to only
one organization.

- Click **Add account** above the list of accounts in the [Organization
Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/org/dashboard).
- Select **Choose from existing accounts**.
- Select the accounts you want to add. If you’re a Super Administrator of an
account, you can add the account to your organization directly. If you’re an
Administrator of an account, you can send an invite to the Super Administrator.
If you’re not sure who the Super Administrator is, check the account’s [team
settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/team). The person who created an
account is automatically made a Super Administrator.
- Click **Add**.

## Add a new account to an organization

- Click **Add account** above the list of accounts in the [Organization
Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/org/dashboard).
- Select **Create a new account in your organization**.
- Enter your **Account name**, then select the country of operation and type of
business.
- *(Optional)* Select any legal entity, public details, or payout bank account
information you want to copy from existing accounts within your organization.
- Click **Create account**.

## Add a new account outside of an organization

- Open the account picker dropdown from anywhere in the Dashboard, then select
**Create new account**.
- Select **Create an account outside of your organization**.
- Enter your **Account name**, then select the country of operation.
- Click **Create**.

## Remove an account from an organization

If an account no longer belongs to your business, you can remove it from your
organization.

- Click the name of your organization in the account picker to open the
[Organization Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/org/dashboard).
- Next to the name of the account you want to remove, click the overflow menu
().
- Click **Remove from organization**.
- After you remove every account from the organization, we permanently close the
organization.

## Centralize your team management

After you create an organization, you can invite additional users to access your
organization. To access your [organization team management
settings](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/orgs/team):

- Open the [Organization Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/org/dashboard)
by clicking your organization’s name in the account picker.
