  "content": "# Migrate subscriptions to Stripe Billing using toolkit\n\n## Learn how to migrate your existing subscriptions to Stripe using the toolkit.\n\nUse the [Billing migration\ntoolkit](https://dashboard.stripe.com/billing/migrations) to migrate your\nexisting [subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating)\nfrom a third-party system, home-grown system, or an existing Stripe account to\nStripe Billing.\n\n## Before you begin\n\n- If you haven’t already, review the [migration\nstages](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/migrate-subscriptions#migration-stages).\n- [Set up a Stripe Billing\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/build-subscriptions)\nbefore you begin migration. This is a one-time setup that you don’t need to\nrepeat for future migrations.\n- [Request a PAN data\nimport](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/data-migrations/pan-import) from\nyour current processor. This step is only required if you’re migrating to Stripe\nfrom another processor. If you’re migrating from Stripe to Stripe, you can skip\nthis prerequisite.\n- If you’re migrating from a third-party or home-grown system, carefully time\nthe cancellation of your existing subscriptions and the creation of new ones in\nStripe. To avoid missing a billing period, create the new subscriptions in\nStripe first, before canceling the old subscriptions. To avoid double billing,\ncancel subscriptions in your old system before the subscriptions are set to\ncharge. For subscriptions with upcoming billing dates close to migration,\nschedule them to start after the cycle so the final bill is in the old system.\n[Open the Billing migration\ntoolkit](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/import-subscriptions-toolkit#open-billing-toolkit)\nSelect the test-mode toggle on the top right corner if you want to run a test\nmigration first.\n\n- Navigate to [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/billing) >\n[Subscriptions](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/subscriptions) >\n[Migrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/billing/migrations).\n\nAlternatively, you can click the overflow menu () next to **+ Create\nsubscription**, and select [Migrate\nsubscriptions](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/migrations).\n- To start your migration, click **Let’s get started**.\n[Download a CSV\nfile](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/import-subscriptions-toolkit#download-csv)\nFirst, export your existing subscriptions by matching the exported data to a\nmigration-compatible CSV file. You can create your own CSV file, or download any\nof the following CSV templates provided by Stripe:\n\n-\n[Basic](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/import-subscriptions-toolkit#basic)\n- [Multi-price\nitems](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/import-subscriptions-toolkit#multi-price)\n- [Ad-hoc\npricing](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/import-subscriptions-toolkit#ad-hoc)\n\nYou can also find examples of CSV files for common migration use cases in the\n[Toolkit CSV\nreference](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/toolkit-reference#migration-use-cases).\n\n- Click **Download CSV template**.\n- Choose a CSV template (basic, multi-price items, or ad-hoc pricing) based on\nyour billing use case.\n\n### Basic CSV\n\nThis example shows a migration for common subscription use cases like quantity,\ntaxes, billing anchor, discounts, trials, and backdating.\n\n### Specify the following fields for a Basic CSV file:\n\n### Multi-price items CSV\n\nThis example shows a migration that has multiple products per subscription.\n\n### Specify the following fields for a Multi-price items CSV file:\n\n### Ad-hoc prices CSV\n\nThis example shows handling a subscription migration using [ad-hoc\npricing](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/create#create_subscription-items-price_data)\nfor existing products.\n\n### Specify the following fields for an Ad-hoc pricing CSV file:\n- In the CSV file, specify the details of the subscriptions you want to export.\n\n#### For Stripe-to-Stripe migrations\n\nIf you’re migrating subscriptions within Stripe accounts, refer to the [CSV\nexample](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/toolkit-reference#within-Stripe-accounts)\nbefore you specify and upload a CSV file.\n[Upload a CSV\nfile](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/import-subscriptions-toolkit#upload-csv)\nClick **Upload CSV**. The CSV file size limit is 120 MB.\n\nStripe validates the file to verify that the uploaded subscriptions are in the\nrequired CSV format. This process might take up to a few hours, depending on the\nsize of the file. If the file is valid, you can proceed to the next step in the\nmigration.\n\n### Resolve validation errors\n\nIf you have any errors in your uploaded file, the toolkit displays a failure\nsummary. To resolve the errors:\n\n- Click **Download file to review errors**.\n- Review the `processing_error` column to see the errors.\n- Correct all the errors. Common errors include:\n\nErrorTroubleshootingInvalid datesMake sure all the dates are in epoch or Unix\ntimestamp format.Incorrect `start_date` rangeMake sure the `start_date` for each\nsubscription is at least 24 hours in the future.Missing dataMake sure every\nrecord contains the required fields.Incompatible price and taxMake sure prices\nfor specified tax rates have the same `tax_behavior` (inclusive versus\nexclusive).\n- Click **Upload revised file** to re-upload the corrected CSV (the CSV file\nsize limit is 120 mb).\n- Wait for re-validation to see the latest validation status.\n[Review uploaded\nsubscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/import-subscriptions-toolkit#review-subscriptions)\nAfter Stripe validates your CSV file, review the summary of your uploaded\nsubscriptions for any discrepancies:\n\n- Cross-check the summary for the correct:\n\n- Date of upload\n- Uploaded file name\n- Number of subscriptions\n- Number of customers\n- First subscription go-live date\n- If everything is valid, click **Start migration**.\n\nIf you see errors, click **Cancel migration** and restart the migration from\n[Download a CSV\nfile](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/import-subscriptions-toolkit#download-csv).\n[Track migration\nprogress](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/import-subscriptions-toolkit#track-migration)\nAfter you review your uploaded subscriptions, track the progress of your\nmigration:\n\n### Migration in progress\n\nYour subscriptions are queued to schedule on the specified start date. This\nprocess can take a few minutes to a few hours, depending on the size of the\nfile. For example, the validation and migration for 100,000 subscriptions takes\napproximately 30 minutes to complete.\n\nThe Billing migration toolkit uses the [Subscription\nschedule](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscription_schedules) to migrate your\nsubscriptions. This allows your subscriptions to remain in a scheduled state for\n24 hours before going live. In test mode, the buffer time is reduced to 1 hour\nfor faster evaluation and testing.\n\n### Scheduled subscriptions\n\nAfter migration, your subscriptions remain in a scheduled state for 24 hours\nbefore going live. You have 10 hours to [cancel these scheduled\nsubscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/import-subscriptions-toolkit#cancel-migration)\nusing the toolkit.\n\nCurrently, you can’t update scheduled subscriptions using the toolkit. If you\nwant to update your scheduled subscriptions, you can either call the\n[update](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscription_schedules/update) endpoint, or\nupdate each subscription (one-by-one) in the\n[Subscriptions](https://dashboard.stripe.com/subscriptions) Dashboard.\n\nCustomers can’t cancel scheduled subscriptions from their customer portal. They\ncan only cancel live subscriptions.\n\n### Go live with subscriptions\n\nAfter 24 hours, your scheduled subscriptions go live and charge customers on\ntheir applicable start dates. You can view all your live subscriptions in the\n[Subscriptions](https://dashboard.stripe.com/subscriptions) Dashboard.\n\nAfter the migration goes live, we recommend you monitor your subscriptions\nstarting from the first payment. Make sure the charge dates and amounts for the\nmigrated subscriptions match the specified\n[start_date](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscription_schedules/create#create_subscription_schedule-start_date).\n\nCustomers can cancel live subscriptions from their customer portal.\n\n### Monitor subscriptions\n\nWhen you monitor your subscriptions after the migration goes live, look out for\nproblems related to payment methods.\n\nFor example, check transactions for unrecoverable issuer [decline\ncodes](https://docs.stripe.com/declines/codes) such as `incorrect_number` and\n[take\naction](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/data-migrations/pan-import#post-import-payment-declines)\nto make sure invoices get paid. Consider notifying customers with invalid\npayment methods through channels other than email, such as text messages or\nin-app notifications.\n\nWhen using automatic collection, check [open or past due\ninvoices](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/collection-method#failed-incomplete-subscriptions)\nto make sure customers aren’t missing [default payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-payment_settings-save_default_payment_method),\nwhich might cause the invoice to be unable to attempt collection.\n\n[View all\nmigrations](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/import-subscriptions-toolkit#view-migrations)\nTo view all of your migrations:\n\n- Select the migration you want to review in\n[Migrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/billing/migrations).\n- To open a migration, click **View** in the dropdown menu.\n\nYou can track the following fields:\n\n- Upload date\n- File name\n- Stripe billing migration id\n- Number of subscriptions\n- Migration status\n[OptionalCancel a\nmigration](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/import-subscriptions-toolkit#cancel-migration)\nIf you identify any problems with the scheduled subscriptions, you can roll back\nthe migration and revert the scheduled subscriptions. The Dashboard displays a\ntimestamp to indicate if you can still cancel the migration using the toolkit.\nYou have 10 hours from when you scheduled the subscriptions to cancel them.\nAfter 10 hours, the cancel option is disabled in the toolkit.\n\n- Find the migration you want to cancel in your\n[Migrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/billing/migrations).\n- Click **Cancel migration** in the dropdown menu.\n\n### Cancel after 10 hours\n\nTo cancel the migration after 10 hours, you can either call the\n[cancel](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscription_schedules/cancel) endpoint, or\nindividually cancel each subscription (one-by-one) in the\n[Subscriptions](https://dashboard.stripe.com/subscriptions) Dashboard.\n\n[OptionalRun multiple\nmigrations](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/import-subscriptions-toolkit#run-multiple-migrations)\nYou can run as many simultaneous subscription migrations as you want. For large\nmigrations, divide the subscriptions into batches and start with a small batch.\nThis can help you quickly identify any validation issues and save validation\ntime.\n\nTo start a new migration:\n\n- Click **Start new migration**.\n- Restart the migration process from [Download a CSV\nfile](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/import-subscriptions-toolkit#download-csv).\n\nYou can also find examples of CSV files for common migration use cases in the\n[Toolkit CSV\nreference](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/toolkit-reference#migration-use-cases).\n\n## See also\n\n- [Toolkit CSV\nreference](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/toolkit-reference)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Billing migration toolkit](https://dashboard.stripe.com/billing/migrations)\n- [subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating)\n- [migration\nstages](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/migrate-subscriptions#migration-stages)\n- [Set up a Stripe Billing\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/build-subscriptions)\n- [Request a PAN data\nimport](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/data-migrations/pan-import)\n- [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/billing)\n- [Subscriptions](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/subscriptions)\n- [Migrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/billing/migrations)\n- [Migrate\nsubscriptions](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/migrations)\n-\n[Basic](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/import-subscriptions-toolkit#basic)\n- [Multi-price\nitems](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/import-subscriptions-toolkit#multi-price)\n- [Ad-hoc\npricing](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/import-subscriptions-toolkit#ad-hoc)\n- [Toolkit CSV\nreference](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/toolkit-reference#migration-use-cases)\n- [ad-hoc\npricing](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/create#create_subscription-items-price_data)\n- [CSV\nexample](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/toolkit-reference#within-Stripe-accounts)\n- [Download a CSV\nfile](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/import-subscriptions-toolkit#download-csv)\n- [Subscription schedule](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscription_schedules)\n- [cancel these scheduled\nsubscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/import-subscriptions-toolkit#cancel-migration)\n- [update](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscription_schedules/update)\n- [Subscriptions](https://dashboard.stripe.com/subscriptions)\n-\n[start_date](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscription_schedules/create#create_subscription_schedule-start_date)\n- [decline codes](https://docs.stripe.com/declines/codes)\n- [take\naction](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/data-migrations/pan-import#post-import-payment-declines)\n- [open or past due\ninvoices](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/collection-method#failed-incomplete-subscriptions)\n- [default payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-payment_settings-save_default_payment_method)\n- [cancel](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscription_schedules/cancel)\n- [Toolkit CSV\nreference](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/toolkit-reference)",
