After the import completes, Stripe provides you with a CSV\nor JSON Mapping File to help you match the old customer IDs to the imported\nStripe object IDs.\n\nTo request this option, submit an [intake\nform](https://support.stripe.com/contact/email?topic=migrations) and select the\nACH payment type.\n\n## Manually migrate bank accounts from another payment processor\n\nIf you choose to migrate yourself, Stripe temporarily allows you to bypass bank\naccount verification. To request this temporary capability, contact [Stripe\nsupport](https://support.stripe.com/contact) and include details about how your\nbusiness:\n\n- Collects authorization from customers\n- Verifies customer bank accounts\n\nAfter Stripe enables this option, process each bank account and create a\n[SetupIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents) for each account:\n\n- Create a new [Customer object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers) or\nretrieve an existing one to associate with this bank account.\n\n```\ncurl -X POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\"\n```\n\n- Create and confirm a SetupIntent with your saved bank account details and the\ndate of your customer’s original authorization to debit the account.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/setup_intents \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d \"payment_method_types[]\"=us_bank_account \\\n -d customer={{CUSTOMER_ID}} \\\n -d confirm=true \\\n -d \"payment_method_options[us_bank_account][verification_method]\"=skip \\\n -d \"payment_method_data[type]\"=us_bank_account \\\n -d \"payment_method_data[billing_details][name]\"={{ACCOUNT_HOLDER_NAME}} \\\n -d \"payment_method_data[us_bank_account][routing_number]\"={{ROUTING_NUMBER}} \\\n -d \"payment_method_data[us_bank_account][account_number]\"={{ACCOUNT_NUMBER}} \\\n -d \"payment_method_data[us_bank_account][account_holder_type]\"=individual \\\n -d \"mandate_data[customer_acceptance][type]\"=offline \\\n -d \"mandate_data[customer_acceptance][accepted_at]\"=1692821946\n```\n\n- Retrieve and store the [PaymentMethod\nID](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents/object#setup_intent_object-payment_method)\nfrom the response to use for [future\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ach-direct-debit/set-up-payment#web-future-payments).\nYou can also retrieve it by\n[listing](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/list) all PaymentMethods\nfor the customer.\n\n## Links\n\n- [intake form](https://support.stripe.com/contact/email?topic=migrations)\n- [Stripe support](https://support.stripe.com/contact)\n- [SetupIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents)\n- [Customer object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers)\n- [PaymentMethod\nID](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents/object#setup_intent_object-payment_method)\n- [future\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ach-direct-debit/set-up-payment#web-future-payments)\n- [listing](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/list)",
