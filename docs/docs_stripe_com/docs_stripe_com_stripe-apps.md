# Stripe Apps

## Extend Stripe with third party services or embed custom user experiences directly in the Stripe Dashboard.

Stripe Apps provides the opportunity to become a third-party developer for
Stripe. You can develop and privately distribute or publish your Stripe app on
the global [Stripe Apps Marketplace](https://marketplace.stripe.com/). As a
third-party Stripe Apps developer, you can create apps to:

- Authenticate users for third-party services using OAuth 2.0 or a restricted
API key (RAK).
- Use the Stripe API to make calls, listen to events, and automate workflows.
For example, you can create an app that automatically initiates a billing flow
when a customer signs a contract, to streamline tasks and reducing manual
account reconciliation.
- Design custom user interfaces that operate directly within the Stripe
Dashboard. For example, users can interact with customer records, balance
statements, and payment information in their CRM systems.

#### Note

Stripe Apps serve as an extension of Stripe. To learn how to accept payments,
see [Payments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments). To accept and send multiparty
payments, see [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect). To build a lightweight
tool you can test, see [Developer tools](https://docs.stripe.com/development).

The main types of apps you can develop

As a Stripe Apps user, you have access to a range of apps on the Stripe Apps
Marketplace to help bolster or expand your business on Stripe. You can also
integrate Stripe into existing third-party services or platforms to synchronize
data fields, trigger external workflows, or use Stripe as a payment processor.
