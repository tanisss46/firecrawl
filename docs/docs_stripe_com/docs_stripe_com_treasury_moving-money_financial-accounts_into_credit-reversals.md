# Moving money with Treasury using CreditReversal objects

## Learn how you can return funds from received credits that add money to your Treasury financial account.

Reversing a
[ReceivedCredit](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/received_credits) creates
a [CreditReversal](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/credit_reversals). You
can reverse `ReceivedCredits` only in some scenarios (detailed in the following
table). Whether you can reverse a `ReceivedCredit` depends on the network and
source flow.

The `reversal_details` sub-hash on the `ReceivedCredit` object can have the
following combination of values, which determines if you can reverse the
`ReceivedCredit`.

RESTRICTED REASONDEADLINE (EPOCH TIMESTAMP)EXAMPLE
SCENARIO`source_flow_restricted``null`A Stripe network `ReceivedCredit` that’s
the result of a flow other than an `OutboundPayment`. Stripe restricts users
from reversing such `ReceivedCredits`.`network_restricted``null`Network
constraints prevent Stripe from allowing reversal on some `ReceivedCredits`,
such as a `ReceivedCredit` from a wire transfer.`null``{{TIMESTAMP}}`A
`ReceivedCredit`, which is reversible, but only until the timestamp in
`deadline`. ACH `ReceivedCredits` have a deadline that determines how long you
have to reverse them.`deadline_passed``{{TIMESTAMP}}`A `ReceivedCredit` that’s
reversible before the timestamp in `deadline`, but is no longer reversible
because the `deadline` has passed. ACH `ReceivedCredits` have a limited time of
when they’re reversible after they’re created.`already_reversed``null`A
`ReceivedCredit` that’s already reversed has this `restricted_reason`. It might
have a non-null `deadline` value.`null``null`You can reverse `ReceivedCredits`
anytime if they have `null` for both `restricted_reason` and `deadline`.
## Create a CreditReversal

Use `POST /v1/treasury/credit_reversals` to create a `CreditReversal`. Set the
`received_credit` parameter in the body of the request to the value of the
`ReceivedCredit` ID to reverse.

#### Note

You can’t update `CreditReversals`, so you must set any optional
[metadata](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/credit_reversals/create#create_credit_reversal-metadata)
on creation.

The following request creates a `CreditReversal` based on the `ReceivedCredit`
ID value on the required `received_credit` parameter. The request also sets an
optional metadata value.

```
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/treasury/credit_reversals \
 -u "sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:" \
 -H "Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}" \
 -d received_credit={{RECEIVED_CREDIT_ID}} \
 -d "metadata[reason]"=Because
```

If successful, the response returns the new `CreditReversal` object.

```
{
 "id": "{{CREDIT_REVERSAL_ID}}",
 "object": "credit_reversal",
 "amount": 1000,
 "currency": "usd",
 "financial_account": "{{FINANCIAL_ACCOUNT_ID}}",
"hosted_regulatory_receipt_url":
"https://payments.stripe.com/regulatory-receipt/{{URL_ID}}",
 "livemode": false,
 "metadata": {
 "csr_id": "CSR-12"
```

## Retrieve a CreditReversal

Use `GET /v1/treasury/credit_reversals/{{CREDIT_REVERSAL_ID}}` to retrieve the
`CreditReversal` with the associated ID.

```
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/treasury/credit_reversals/{{CREDIT_REVERSAL_ID}}
\
 -u "sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:" \
 -H "Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}"
```

The response returns the specific `CreditReversal` object.

```
{
 "id": "{{CREDIT_REVERSAL_ID}}",
 "object": "credit_reversal",
 "livemode": "{{Boolean}}",
 "created": "{{Timestamp}}",
 "financial_account": "{{FINANCIAL_ACCOUNT_ID}}",
 "amount": 1000,
 "currency": "usd",
 // The ReceivedCredit that was reversed
 "received_credit": "{{RECEIVED_CREDIT_ID}}",
 // The rails used to reversed. Always the same as that of the ReceivedCredit
 "network": "ach",
 "status": "processing" | "posted",
 "status_transitions": {
 "posted_at": null | "{{Timestamp}}",
 },
 // Transaction representing balance impact of the CreditReversal
 "transaction": "{{TRANSACTION_ID}}",
// A unique, Stripe-hosted direct link to the regulatory receipt for the
CreditReversal
 "hosted_regulatory_receipt_url": "{{Url}}",
 // A map of String-String intended for users to use custom data
 "metadata": {},
}
```

## List CreditReversals

Use `GET /v1/treasury/credit_reversals` to retrieve a list of `CreditReversals`
for the financial account with the ID provided in the required
`financial_account` parameter. You can filter the list by standard list
parameters, `status`, or by `ReceivedCredit` ID using the `received_credit`
parameter.

```
{
 // Standard list parameters
 "limit", "starting_after", "ending_before",
 // Filter by status
 "status": "processing" | "posted",
 // Filter by FinancialAccount (Required)
 "financial_account": "{{FINANCIAL_ACCOUNT_ID}}",
 // Filter by ReceivedCredit
 "received_credit": "{{RECEIVED_CREDIT_ID}}"
}

```

The following request returns the three most recent credit reversals with a
status of `posted` for the specified financial account.

```
curl -G https://api.stripe.com/v1/treasury/credit_reversals \
 -u "sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:" \
 -H "Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}" \
 -d limit=3 \
 -d status=posted \
 -d financial_account={{FINANCIAL_ACCOUNT_ID}}
```

If successful, the response returns the relevant list of [CreditReversal
objects](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/credit_reversals).

## Test CreditReversals

To test CreditReversals, you must first create [test mode
ReceivedCredits](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/financial-accounts/into/credit-reversals#testingrc).
Then use `POST /v1/treasury/credit_reversals` and specify the test mode
`ReceivedCredit` ID in the `received_credit` parameter to create a test mode
`CreditReversal`.

## CreditReversal Webhooks

Stripe emits the following `CreditReversal` events to your
[webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) endpoint:

- `treasury.credit_reversal.created` on `CreditReversal` creation.
- `treasury.credit_reversal.posted` when the `CreditReversal` posts.
