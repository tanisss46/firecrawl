# Review tools

## Learn how to use manual reviews to supplement programmatic systems with human expertise.

While Stripe’s programmatic systems work to detect fraudulent verifications, you
can perform manual reviews to provide an extra layer of fraud protection.

For example, you might want to review verifications when:

- Your customer submits a document from an unexpected country
- Your customer contacts you about a potential mistake in their verification
- Your business requirements differ from Stripe Identity’s default risk
thresholds

Manual reviews and [insights](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/insights) in
Stripe Identity allow you to examine unusual verifications and update
verification statuses.

## Reviewing verifications

You can review verifications in two ways. The [list
view](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/review-tools#list-view) allows you to
scan a list of verifications without seeing details about a verification, while
the [detailed view](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/review-tools#detailed-view)
provides more context.

### List view

The list view contains information to help you quickly get a sense of the state
of each verification. It includes information on overall verification status,
document country, extracted name, and individual verification check status.

### Detailed view

To see more information about a verification before making a decision, select
the verification from the list view to navigate to a detailed view. In this
view, you can inspect the individual images collected alongside available
[insights](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/insights).

### Actions

After you review a verification, take one of the following actions:

- **Override status**: Manually override the verification status to match your
decision on whether or not the customer is verified. Stripe sends a [webhook
event](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/handle-verification-outcomes) with the
new status.
- **Add to blocklist**: Add the document to a blocklist to programmatically
block future verifications completed with the same document.

### Biometric duplicates

When processing new verification attempts, Stripe reviews your completed
verifications for duplicate identities using biometric data (for example, based
on a selfie) to make sure that each identity is unique.

If we detect a duplicate selfie, we’ll share a list of verification sessions
where the duplicate is detected and how many times it’s found in each session.

## Blocklist

To prevent Stripe Identity from using a document or selfie in programmatic
verifications, add it to the blocklist. When a verification includes data that
matches a blocklist entry, Stripe automatically sets that verification’s status
to ‘unverified‘ until you review it in the Dashboard.

We support adding blocklist entries of the following types:

- **Document**: matches against the combination of the type of the document, the
document number, and the document country.
- **Selfie**: matches against the facial mapping of the selfie image uploaded
during verification.

#### Note

Manually review each verification marked as `unverified` by the blocklist. If
any of them are incorrect, you can manually [override their verification
status](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/review-tools#actions).

### Add a blocklist entry

From the [Identity](https://dashboard.stripe.com/identity) page in the
Dashboard, find the Verification session containing the data you want to add to
the blocklist. Click the overflow menu ​​() in the top right, then select **Add
to blocklist**.

### Disable a blocklist entry

On the blocklist entry details page, click **Disable** in the top right. A
disabled blocklist entry no longer causes Stripe Identity to automatically set
verifications matching it to `unverified`.

You can’t re-enable a disabled blocklist entry. To restore a disabled entry,
open the Verification session containing that document or selfie, and create a
new entry with the same data.

#### Note

Redacting a Verification session deletes any blocklist entries created from it.

## Identity analytics

On the [Analytics](https://dashboard.stripe.com/identity/overview) tab of the
Identity Dashboard, you can view usage and verification rates over time and
track user progression through verification funnel stages. This data comes from
live verification sessions and excludes test sessions.

### About the data

Stripe calculates analytics for
[VerificationSessions](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions)
in the following ways:

- **Verifications created**: The total number of verifications created,
including those that are abandoned, canceled, redacted, or otherwise unfinished.
- **Verifications started**: The number of verifications that a user visited and
then started the verification process for.
- **Verification submitted**: The number of verifications that were completed
and submitted by a user. You’re charged for every submitted verification,
regardless of the outcome.
- **Verifications successful**: The number of verifications that were verified
successfully after submission.
- **Completion rate**: The rate at which started verifications were completed
and submitted by a user. Stripe divides the number of submitted verifications by
the number of started verifications.
- **Verification rate**: The rate at which submitted verifications were verified
successfully. Stripe divides the number of verified verifications by the number
of submitted verifications.

Verification sessions can have multiple attempts (in case the user is unverified
after an initial attempt). Each attempt generates a new
[VerificationReport](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports),
and Stripe calculates a number of verification report metrics:

- **Verification reports created**: The number of verification attempts that
were completed and submitted.
- **Verification reports successful**: The number of verification attempts that
were verified successfully after submission.

## Best practices

Use the following best practices to get the most out of reviews and perform them
efficiently:

- **Focus on verifications where human judgment or manual review adds valuable
insight to the determination of whether the customer’s identity is verified.**

Our systems can make determinations on identity verification on the majority of
verification sessions, but human judgment can improve accuracy for some cases.
- **Use insights and context from your business to make an informed decision.**

Use the data in the [Insights](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/insights)
section to see how Stripe made the decision on the document or face image.
Combining Insights, knowledge about your business, and human judgment can help
you make an informed choice about when to trust or ignore the risk signals that
Identity indicates.
- **Apply what reviewers learn to develop fraud prevention strategies.**

As reviewers sort through your verifications, they develop intuitions for fraud
prevention that you can translate into updates to your integration with
Identity.
- **Customize the process by presenting data unique to your business at review
time.**

Pass along any additional customer information as metadata so that all relevant
information is in the Dashboard at the time of review.
- **Don’t slow down your customer.**

A review implies some amount of time between verification completion and
enabling the capabilities within your business for the customer. If your
business has an inherent delay of this type (for example, Identity is a part of
a more long form review process), taking the time to review a verification
doesn’t change the customer experience. If you don’t have a built-in delay,
adding a review process could slow down customers—consider the impact on them
before you implement a review process. For example, build out workflows for
handling situations when the verification status changes for a customer after
they’ve already been verified.
- **Implement customer support workflows.**

Prepare to handle customer requests regarding their verification status and
offer a non-biometric method for identity verification if they request it.
