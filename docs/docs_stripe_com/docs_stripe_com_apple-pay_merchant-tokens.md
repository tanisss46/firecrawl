# Apple Pay merchant tokens

## Learn how to use Apple Pay merchant tokens for recurring, deferred, and automatic reload payments.

An [Apple Pay merchant token
(MPAN)](https://developer.apple.com/apple-pay/merchant-tokens/) ties together a
payment card, a business, and a customer, and enables the wallet holder to
manage access to a card stored in their Apple wallet. Apple Payâ€™s latest
guidelines recommend merchant tokens over device tokens (DPANs) because merchant
tokens:

- Allow for continuity across multiple devices
- Enable recurring payments independent of a device
- Keep payment information active in a new device even when its removed from a
lost or stolen device
- Come with lifecycle management features to monitor changes to a token or to
see if a token has been revoked

## Merchant token types

You can use Apple Pay to request an MPAN in three ways. Each type of request has
different parameters that affect how the user is presented with Apple Wallet.
Almost all request types provide the option to supply a `managementURL`, which
routes customers to a webpage to manage their payment methods. If you request an
MPAN and the issuer supports MPAN generation, you receive an MPAN. Otherwise,
you receive a DPAN.

## Add Apple Pay merchant tokens

You can add a [merchant
token](https://developer.apple.com/apple-pay/merchant-tokens/) when presenting
Apple Pay in the Express Checkout Element, web Payment Element, and mobile
Payment Element. Stripe automatically handles merchant token requests in Stripe
Checkout integrations.

Express Checkout ElementWeb Payment Element- Set up [Express Checkout Element
integration](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/express-checkout-element/accept-a-payment).
- Pass the `applePay` object relevant to your MPAN use case (choose from the
drop-down to see use case code samples).
- Include relevant parameters for your use case.
MPAN use case:Recurring paymentsAutomatic reloadDeferred payment
```
elements.create('expressCheckout', {
 applePay: {
 recurringPaymentRequest: {
 paymentDescription: "Standard Subscription",
 regularBilling: {
 amount: 1000,
 label: "Standard Package",
 recurringPaymentStartDate: new Date("2023-03-31"),
 recurringPaymentEndDate: new Date("2024-03-31"),
 recurringPaymentIntervalUnit: "year",
 recurringPaymentIntervalCount: 1,
 },
 billingAgreement: "billing agreement",
 managementURL: "https://stripe.com",
 },
 },
});
```

## Merchant token auth rate monitoring

For Sigma users, the `charges` table contains a `card_token_type` enum field to
indicate the charge is using an `mpan` or `dpan` card. The following Sigma query
example calculates the MPAN auth rate:

```
-- deduplicated MPAN auth rate
select
 100.0 * count(
 case
 when charge_outcome in ('authorized', 'manual_review') then 1
 end
 ) / count(*) as deduplicated_auth_rate_pct,
 count(*) as n_attempts
from
 authentication_report_attempts a
 join charges c on c.id = a.charge_id
where
 c.created >= date('2021-01-01')
 and c.card_tokenization_method = 'apple_pay'
 -- The new field added to charges table.
 and c.card_token_type = 'mpan'
 -- deduplicate multiple manual retries to a single representative charge
 and is_final_attempt
```
