Adjustments in the invoice balance could\nbe a credit (meaning you owe them money) or a debit (meaning they owe you\nmoney). These adjustments sum up to a balance on the customer that you can apply\nto future [invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices).\n\nBecause the invoice balance is computed from a ledger — an immutable list of\ndebit and credit transactions — it provides an audit trail of transactions for\nthe customer. These [Customer Balance\nTransactions](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_balance_transactions/object)\ncan refer to the object related to the adjustment (such as a [Credit\nNote](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/dashboard/credit-notes) or\n[Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/customer)), or even\n[metadata](https://docs.stripe.com/api/metadata) for your own reference.\n\n## Example use cases\n\nSome common use cases for customer invoice balances include:\n\n- [Issuing a Credit\nNote](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/dashboard/credit-notes) to create a\ncredit that reduces the amount due on the next invoice.\n- Prorations from [downgrading a\nsubscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/upgrade-downgrade)\ncan indirectly create credits to reduce the amount due on the next invoice.\n- When the amount due on an invoice is less than the [minimum chargeable\namount](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts)\nthe invoice is marked as paid and the amount owed moved to the invoice balance\nas a debit. This functionality only occurs for customers without a\n[cash_balance](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance#cash-balances).\n\n## Customer invoice balance details\n\nKeep the following details in mind when using customer invoice balances:\n\n- The invoice balance automatically applies toward the next invoice finalized to\na customer.\n- You can’t choose a specific invoice to apply the invoice balance to.\n- You can’t choose to not apply the invoice balance to an invoice.\n- The invoice balance is in the customer’s currency.\n- Customers with a [cash\nbalance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-cash_balance)\ncan’t keep a positive balance. In other words, they can’t increase the amount\ndue on the next invoice.\n- The invoice balance doesn’t apply to invoices created by Checkout Sessions\nwith\n[invoice_creation](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-invoice_creation)\nenabled.\n- You can’t apply invoice balances to previously created invoices that are still\nopen. However, [editing an open\ninvoice](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/invoice-edits) applies any invoice\nbalance to the invoice revision.\n\n## Debits and credits\n\n**Negative values** are treated as a **credit** (a reduction in the amount owed\nby the customer) that you can apply to the next invoice.\n\n**Positive values** are treated as a **debit** (an increase in the amount owed\nby the customer to you) that you can apply to the next invoice.\n\n## Transactions\n\nAll modifications to the invoice balance are recorded as\n[Transactions](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_balance_transactions/object).\nAfter it’s been created, you can only update its `description` or `metadata`—you\ncan’t edit other properties or delete a transaction.\n\n### Undo a transaction\n\nYou can only undo a transaction by creating a corresponding, reversing\ntransaction. For example, if you credit the customer 10 USD, you must debit the\ncustomer 10 USD in a new transaction, each canceling the other out.\n\n### Transaction types\n\nAll\n[Transactions](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_balance_transactions/object)\ncreated with the API or in the Dashboard have a\n[type](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_balance_transactions/object#customer_balance_transaction_object-type)\nvalue of `adjustment`, representing a debit or credit manually created by you\nfor the customer.\n\nThe `type` property has many more possible values to represent the creation\nsource and reason for the transaction. The following table outlines and\ndescribes each of these `type` values:\n\nTypeDescription`adjustment`An explicitly created adjustment transaction to debit\nor credit the invoice balance. This is the only type of transaction that you can\ncreate using API integrations and the Dashboard.`applied_to_invoice`Traces the\napplication of credit against a linked\n[Invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/overview).`credit_note`Traces the\ncreation of credit to a [Credit\nNote](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/dashboard/credit-notes) and it’s\nassociated\n[Invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/overview).`invoice_too_small`When\nthe amount due on an invoice is less than Stripe’s [minimum chargeable\namount](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts)\nand the customer does not have a cash balance, the invoice is debited to the\ninvoice balance and added to the amount due of the next issued\ninvoice.`invoice_too_large`When the amount due on an invoice is greater than\nStripe’s [maximum chargeable\namount](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts)\nand the customer does not have a cash balance, the invoice is debited to the\ninvoice balance and added to the amount due of the next issued\ninvoice.`unapplied_from_invoice`Traces the reversal of an applied invoice\nbalance from a linked [Invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing). Paired with\nan earlier `applied_to_invoice` transaction.`unspent_receiver_credit`When\nunspent funds in [receiver\nSources](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#flow-for-customer-action) attached to a\ncustomer without a cash balance aren’t fully charged after 60 days, Stripe\nautomatically charges them on your behalf and credits your balance. When this\nhappens, Stripe also creates a corresponding credit\ntransaction.`initial`Represents the starting value of the customer invoice\nbalance when a customer is created using the API with a non-zero invoice\nbalance.\n## Modify the invoice balance\n\nYou can modify a customer invoice balance in the Dashboard by creating a new\n[Customer Balance\nTransaction](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_balance_transactions/object)\nadjustment from the customer details page.\n\nUnder **Customer invoice balance**, click **Adjust balance** to display the\n**Credit balance adjustment** modal.\n\nYou can set information about the adjustment, such as:\n\n- **Adjustment type**: Choose credit or debit\n- **Currency**: Available only if the customer doesn’t have a currency set\n- **Amount**\n- **Internal note**: Visible to Dashboard users, but not to the customer\n\n![How to adjust a customer's subscription\nbalance.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/2-Customer-balance.ed7d6df96ba2b8595461e1091e4da7a9.png)\n\n### API\n\nCreate adjustments using the [Customer Balance\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_balance_transactions/create), as shown\nin the following code example.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers/cus_4fdAW5ftNQow1a/balance_transactions\n\\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d amount=-500 \\\n -d currency=usd\n```\n\n## Invoice balance transaction history\n\nAudit adjustments to a customer invoice balance in the Dashboard on their\ncustomer details page, under **Customer invoice balance**.\n\nThis section displays the current value of the invoice balance. Click **View\ndetails** to see the transaction history used to calculate that value. Each\ntransaction line displays information relevant to the [transaction\ntype](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance#types), such as a link to\nthe invoice that applied the invoice balance, or the credit note that credited\nthe balance.\n\n![Viewing the invoice balance transaction\nhistory](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/3-Balance-history.446845092bb178c7924a9cbee2538f94.png)\n\n### API\n\nUse the [Customer Balance\nList](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_balance_transactions/list) to\nretrieve a list of all transactions for a customer.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers/cus_4fdAW5ftNQow1a/balance_transactions\n\\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\"\n```\n\n## Customer cash balances\n\nCustomers using the [bank\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bank-transfers) payment method have\na [cash balance\nobject](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-cash_balance)\nwith one or more currencies in the `available` object. You can use the funds to\n[make\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/customer-balance#make-cash-payment)\nor pay invoices. Customers with available balances have the following behavior:\n\n- You can’t create a negative customer cash balance since it represents money\nsent from the `Customer`.\n- You can’t finalize a too-small or too-large invoice with the cash balance (for\nexample, creating a subscription for 0.01 USD). Learn more about [minimum and\nmaximum\namounts](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts).\n- You can delete `Customers` that have a cash balance, but only if their cash\nbalance is 0.\n- You can’t remove a `Customer`’s available balance.\n\n## Links\n\n- [invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n- [Customer Balance\nTransactions](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_balance_transactions/object)\n- [Credit Note](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/dashboard/credit-notes)\n- [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/customer)\n- [metadata](https://docs.stripe.com/api/metadata)\n- [downgrading a\nsubscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/upgrade-downgrade)\n- [minimum chargeable\namount](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts)\n- [cash\nbalance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-cash_balance)\n-\n[invoice_creation](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-invoice_creation)\n- [editing an open invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/invoice-edits)\n-\n[type](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_balance_transactions/object#customer_balance_transaction_object-type)\n- [Invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/overview)\n- [Invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing)\n- [receiver Sources](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#flow-for-customer-action)\n- [Customer Balance\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_balance_transactions/create)\n- [Customer Balance\nList](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_balance_transactions/list)\n- [bank transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bank-transfers)\n- [make\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/customer-balance#make-cash-payment)",
