Remote sellers must register to collect and remit tax in Minnesota when, in the
prior 12 months, they do one of the following:

- Exceed a sales threshold of 100,000 USD

The thresholds include retail sales, including marketplace sales and sales of
taxable services. The thresholds exclude wholesale sales (sales of resale) and
sales of nontaxable services.
