# Renames application_fee on invoices to application_fee_amountBreaking changes

## What’s new

Renames both the `application_fee` parameter on Invoice API methods and the
`application_fee` field on the `Invoice` object to `application_fee_amount`.

## Impact

This change renames the `application_fee` parameter and field to
`application_fee_amount` in the invoice API methods and `Invoice` object. You
need to update your code to use the new `application_fee_amount` name when
setting or retrieving application fee information for invoices. This
modification provides more clarity about the nature of the value (an amount
rather than a fee object), but requires updates to existing code that handles
application fees.
