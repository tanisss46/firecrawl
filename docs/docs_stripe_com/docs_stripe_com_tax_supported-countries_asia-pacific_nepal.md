# Collect tax in Nepal

## Learn how to use Stripe Tax to calculate, collect, and report tax in Nepal.

In Nepal, Stripe only supports collecting
[VAT](https://ird.gov.np/public/pdf/1990850399.pdf) for digital services. In
Stripe, these are referred to as “digital products.” To collect this tax on
Stripe, you must be a remote seller without a physical presence in the country.

## When to register for tax collection

See [Thresholds](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/thresholds) to get insights
about your potential tax registration obligations in Nepal. Stripe also notifies
you with email and Dashboard alerts when you need to register to collect tax.
Learn more about how the [monitoring tool
works](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/monitoring).

Remote sellers providing digital services (digital products) to customers in
Nepal must register for VAT if the total value within a period of 12 months
exceeds NPR 3,000,000.

- **Threshold**: NPR 3 million
- **Time frame**: 12 months
- **Included transactions**: Business-to-consumer (B2C) sales of digital goods
or electronically supplied services (digital products)

## Register to collect tax

You must be a remote seller with no physical presence in Nepal to collect this

After you’ve registered to collect tax in Nepal, go to

Learn more about [how to add your
registration](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/registering#track-your-registrations-in-the-tax-dashboard)
in the Dashboard.

## How we calculate taxes

We only support calculations for [digital
products](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes?type=digital) (non-physical
items or services that are delivered, given, or rendered electronically) in
Nepal. Stripe doesn’t calculate tax for products that don’t use a digital
product tax code.

View the list of supported [digital product tax
codes](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes?type=digital). To calculate taxes
in Nepal, make sure that you [assign a tax
code](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/products-prices-tax-codes-tax-behavior#tax-code-on-product)
to each of your products.

## Report and file your taxes

Stripe provides reports of your completed tax transactions. Go to
[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations) to access these
reports. Learn more about [the different types of
reports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports).

You’re responsible for filing and remitting your taxes to Nepal. Stripe doesn’t
file taxes on your behalf.
