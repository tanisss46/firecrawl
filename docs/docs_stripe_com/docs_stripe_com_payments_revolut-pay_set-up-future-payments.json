[Register\nnow](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register).\n\nUse our official libraries for access to the Stripe API from your application:\n\n```\n# Available as a gem\nsudo gem install stripe\n```\n\n```\n# If you use bundler, you can add this line to your Gemfile\ngem 'stripe'\n```\n\n[Getting permission to save a payment\nmethodServer-side](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/revolut-pay/set-up-future-payments#web-permissions)\nIf you save your customer’s payment method for future use, you need permission.\nCreating an agreement (sometimes called a mandate) up front allows you to save\nyour customer’s payment details, and potentially charge your customer when\nthey’re not actively using your website or app.\n\nAdd terms to your website or app that state how you plan to save your customer’s\npayment method details, and let your customer opt in. If you plan to charge your\ncustomer when they’re offline, make sure that your terms also cover the\nfollowing:\n\n- The customer’s permission to your initiating a payment or a series of payments\non their behalf for specified transactions\n- The anticipated frequency (that is, one-time or recurring) and timing of\npayments\n- How you determine the payment amount\n- Your cancellation policy, if you’re setting the payment method up for a\nsubscription service\n\nMake sure that you keep a record of your customer’s written agreement to these\nterms.\n\n[Create or retrieve a\nCustomerServer-side](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/revolut-pay/set-up-future-payments#web-create-customer)\nTo reuse a Revolut Pay payment method for future payments, attach it to a\n[Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers).\n\nCreate a [Customer object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers) when your\ncustomer creates an account with your business, and associate the ID of the\nCustomer object with your own internal representation of a customer.\nAlternatively, you can create a new Customer before saving a payment method for\nfuture payments.\n\nCreate a new Customer or retrieve an existing Customer to associate with this\npayment. Include the following code on your server to create a new Customer:\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n --data-urlencode description=\"My First Test Customer (created for API docs)\"\n```\n\n[Create a Checkout\nSessionServer-side](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/revolut-pay/set-up-future-payments#web-create-checkout-session)\nYour customer must authorize you to use their Revolut account for future\npayments through Stripe Checkout. This allows you to accept Revolut payments.\nAdd a checkout button to your website that calls a server-side endpoint to\ncreate a [Checkout Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions).\n\n```\n<html>\n <head>\n <title>Checkout</title>\n </head>\n <body>\n <form action=\"/create-checkout-session\" method=\"POST\">\n <button type=\"submit\">Checkout</button>\n </form>\n </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nCreate a Checkout Session in `setup` mode to collect the required information.\nAfter creating the Checkout Session, redirect your customer to the\n[URL](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object#checkout_session_object-url)\nthat the response returns.\n\n```\nStripe::Checkout::Session.create({\n mode: 'setup',\n payment_method_types: ['card'],\n payment_method_types: ['card', 'revolut_pay'],\n customer: customer.id,\n success_url: 'https://example.com/success',\n cancel_url: 'https://example.com/cancel',\n})\n```\n\n[Test your\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/revolut-pay/set-up-future-payments#web-test-integration)\nSelect Revolut Pay as the payment method, then click **Continue to Revolut\nPay**. You can test the successful setup case by authenticating the SetupIntent\non the redirect page. The SetupIntent transitions from requires_action to\nsucceeded.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout)\n- [set up a subscription with Revolut\nPay](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/revolut-pay)\n- [Register now](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register)\n- [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers)\n- [Checkout Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions)\n-\n[URL](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object#checkout_session_object-url)\n- [https://example.com/success](https://example.com/success)\n- [https://example.com/cancel](https://example.com/cancel)",
