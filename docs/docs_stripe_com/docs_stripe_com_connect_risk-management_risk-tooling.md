# Merchant risk toolingPrivate preview

## Use Stripe tools to prevent and manage merchant risk.

If you decide to manage merchant risk yourself, Stripe offers tools to help you:

- Identify a potentially fraudulent connected account using a fraud risk score.
- Investigate a connected account by reviewing risk metrics and fraud
indicators.
- Gather additional information about a connected account through document
verification and a selfie check.
- Take action against a connected account by pausing payouts, pausing payments,
rejecting the account, or blocking its external payout account.

## Identify potentially fraudulent connected accounts

Stripe provides a fraud risk score for each connected account based on the
risk-related signals that we collect. In your Dashboard, you can filter the
[accounts
overview](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard/viewing-all-accounts) based
on the fraud risk score. The Home page also alerts you to potentially fraudulent
connected accounts.

## Investigate a connected account

In your Dashboard, you can view the following information in the connected
account details page:

- The fraud risk score of the connected account
- Potential fraud indicators, which provide you with suggestions for potential
areas to investigate further
- Risk-related metrics, such as declines, disputes, and refunds, specific to
that connected account

## Gather additional information

To gather more information on the connected account, you can ask to verify a
government-issued ID document and, optionally, a selfie. When you do so, you
also set an enforcement that automatically occurs if the connected account
doesnâ€™t successfully complete the verification. This enforcement can either be
to pause payouts only, or to pause both payouts and payments. This enforcement
can occur either after a certain period of time or after a certain total
lifetime volume.

## Take action

You can pause payments, pause payouts, or reject a connected account using the
API or the Dashboard.
