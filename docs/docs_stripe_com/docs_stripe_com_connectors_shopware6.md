# Stripe Connector for Shopware 6

## Learn how to help your customers check out and accept payments using the Shopware 6 connector.

Use the Stripe Connector for [Shopware 6](https://www.shopware.com/en/) to build
an integration that allows you to accept payments in many countries. The
connector integrates [Stripe
Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements), an embedded UI component
that lets you accept more than 25 payment methods with a single integration and
that comes with the following features:

- Built-in conversion logic: Increase conversion by reducing user friction and
errors with features such as address auto-complete, real-time card validation,
descriptive error messages, and third-party auto-fill.
- Global payment conversion: Dynamically display the right language, currency,
and payment methods most likely to improve conversion. Stripe supports over 25
languages, 135 currencies, and 25 payment methods.
- Authorize payments and capture later: Stripe supports separate card
authorization and capture, which lets you collect card information, verify
sufficient funds, and then capture the total amount after shipping.
- Works with any device: Provide customers with a responsive checkout across
mobile, tablet, and desktop, and offer Apple Pay and Google Pay out of the box.

## Global payment methods

You can turn on payment methods from the Stripe Dashboard. To increase
conversion, Stripe dynamically displays the most relevant payment methods based
on your customerâ€™s location and device. As Stripe adds new payment methods, you
can turn them on without needing additional integrations. Use the connector to
enable the following payment methods:

- **Credit and debit cards**: Visa, Mastercard, American Express, China
UnionPay, Discover and Diners, Japan Credit Bureau (JCB), Cartes Bancaires
