  "content": "# Create a charge\n\n## Create a charge and split payments between your platform and your sellers or service providers.\n\nTo accept a payment from a customer, you must first create a charge. The type of\ncharge you create—[direct](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges#direct),\n[destination](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges#destination), or [separate\ncharges and\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges#separate-charges-transfers)—determines\nhow these funds are split among all parties involved, impacts how the charge\nappears on the customer’s bank or billing statement (with your platform’s\ninformation or your user’s), and determines which account Stripe debits for\nrefunds and chargebacks.\n\n## Charge types\n\nThere are many factors to consider when choosing a charge type, as listed in the\ntable below. Your platform’s business model is particularly important because it\ncan affect how funds flow through Stripe. To review charge type recommendations\nfor your business, refer to your [platform\nprofile](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/settings/profile).\n\nCharge typeUse whenExamples[Direct\ncharges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges)- Customers directly\ntransact with your connected account, often unaware of your platform’s\nexistence.\n- The transaction involves a single user.\n- You’d like to choose if Stripe fees are debited from your connected accounts\nor your platform\n- An e-commerce platform like Shopify or Squarespace\n- An accounting platform that enables invoice payments like Freshbooks\n[Destination charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges)-\nCustomers transact with your platform for products or services provided by your\nconnected account.\n- The transaction involves a single user.\n- Stripe fees are debited from your platform account.\n- A ride-hailing service like Lyft\n- A services platform like Thumbtack\n[Separate charges and\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)Any\none of these instances:- The transaction involves multiple users.\n- A specific user isn’t known at the time of charge.\n- Transfer can’t be made at the time of charge.\n- Stripe fees and processing fees are debited from your platform account.\n- An e-commerce marketplace that allows a single shopping cart for goods sold by\nmultiple businesses\n\nYou can use a single approach, more than one approach, or switch approaches as\nappropriate for your organization.\n\n### Direct charges\n\nCreate a charge directly on a connected account. Customers are often unaware of\nyour platform’s existence. You can add an application fee to the charge which is\ntransferred to your platform’s account balance.\n\nThis charge type is best suited for platforms providing software as a service.\nFor example, Shopify provides tools for building online storefronts, and\nThinkific enables educators to sell online courses.\n\nWith this charge type:\n\n- You create a charge on your user’s account so the payment appears as a charge\non the connected account, not in your account balance.\n- The connected account’s balance increases with every charge.\n- Funds always settle in the country of the connected account.\n- Your account balance increases with application fees from every charge.\n- The connected account’s balance is debited for refunds and chargebacks.\n- You can choose whether to have Stripe debit fees directly from connected\naccounts or from your platform account.\n\n![Direct charges funds flow\ndiagram](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/direct_charges.a2a8b68037ac95fe22140d6dde9740d3.svg)\n\nHow are funds routed with direct charges?\n\n#### Caution\n\nOnly connected accounts with the [card_payments\ncapability](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities#card-payments)\ncan be directly charged.\n\n### Destination charges\n\nCreate a charge on the platform and immediately transfers funds to a specified\nconnected account. You decide whether some or all of those funds are\ntransferred, and whether to deduct an application fee.\n\nThis charge type is best suited for marketplaces such as Airbnb, a home rental\nmarketplace or Lyft, a ridesharing app.\n\nWith this charge type:\n\n- You create a charge on your platform’s account so the payment appears as a\ncharge on your account. Then, you determine whether some or all of those funds\nare transferred to the connected account (see funds flow diagrams below).\n- Your platform account balance is debited for the cost of the Stripe fees,\nrefunds, and chargebacks.\n\n![Destination charges balance funds flow\ndiagram](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/platform_charges.6a14fd660d7433ba617e816ff09f10b5.svg)\n\nSend the balance after platform fee to your connected account.\n\n![Destination charges funds flow\ndiagram](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/application_fee_amount.837aa2339469b3c1a4319672971c1367.svg)\n\nSend the full payment amount to your connected account, then charge your\nplatform fee.\n\n#### Caution\n\nIn most scenarios, destination charges are only supported if both your platform\nand the connected account are in the same region (for example, both in the US).\nFor cross-region support, you can specify the [settlement\nmerchant](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges#settlement-merchant)\nto the connected account using the\n[on_behalf_of](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-on_behalf_of)\nattribute on the charge. For more information about cross-region support, see\n[Cross-border\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities#transfers-cross-border).\n\n### Separate charges and transfers\n\nCreate charges on your platform and split funds between multiple connected\naccounts, or hold them when you don’t know the specific user at the time of the\ncharge. The charge on your platform account is decoupled from the transfers to\nyour connected accounts.\n\nThis charge type is best suited for marketplaces that need to split payments\nbetween multiple parties, such as DoorDash, a restaurant delivery platform.\n\nFor [Express](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/express-accounts) and\n[Custom](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom-accounts) accounts, Stripe\nrecommends that you create [separate charges and\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers) if\ndestination charges don’t meet your business needs.\n\nWith this charge type:\n\n- You create a charge on your platform’s account first. Create a separate\ntransfer to move funds to your connected account. The payment appears as a\ncharge on your account and there’s also a transfer to a connected account\n(amount determined by you), which is withdrawn from your [account\nbalance](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-balances).\n- You can transfer funds to multiple connected accounts.\n- Your account balance is debited for the cost of the Stripe fees, refunds, and\nchargebacks.\n\n![Transfer funds flow\ndiagram](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/charges_transfers.a95f5bf398651fba0fb303e32a742546.svg)\n\nTransfer funds to multiple connected accounts.\n\n#### Caution\n\nIn most scenarios, your platform and any connected account must be in the same\nregion. Attempting to transfer funds across a disallowed border returns an\nerror. For information about cross-region support, see [Cross-border\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities#transfers-cross-border).\n\nUsing separate charges and transfers requires a more complex\n[Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect) integration.\n\nUse this charge type if your business has specific use cases:\n\n- A one-to-many relationship. For example, a payment made to a delivery service\nneeds to be split between the store (the source of the items being delivered)\nand the delivery person.\n- A many-to-one relationship. For example, a carpool trip with a ride-hailing\nservice.\n- Charges created before the destination account is known. For example, a\njanitorial service could process a payment before deciding which janitor to\nassign to the job.\n- Need to transfer funds before receiving a payment, or while the charge is\npending. For example, an ad network needs to purchase ad space before they can\nsell ad time or before receiving any payment from customers.\n- Transfer amounts greater than the associated payments. For example, a platform\nprovides a discount to its customer but pays its user the full amount.\n\nIn some cases, the transfer amount can be greater than the charge amount, or the\ntransfer is made before the payment is processed. You must monitor your account\nbalance carefully to make sure it has enough available funds to cover the\ntransfer amount. You can also associate a transfer with a charge so the transfer\ndoesn’t occur until the funds from that charge are available.\n\n#### on_behalf_of parameter\n\nTo make the connected account the business of record for the payment use the\n`on_behalf_of` parameter. When `on_behalf_of` is set to the ID of the connected\naccount, Stripe automatically:\n\n- Settles charges in the country of the specified account, thereby minimizing\ndeclines and avoiding [currency\nconversions](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/currencies#currency-conversions).\n- Uses the fee structure for the connected account’s country.\n- Uses the [connected account’s statement\ndescriptor](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/statement-descriptors).\n- If the account is in a different country than the platform, the connected\naccount’s address and phone number shows up on the customer’s credit card\nstatement (as opposed to the platform’s).\n- The number of days that a [pending\nbalance](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-balances) is held before being\npaid out depends on the `delay_days` setting on the connected account.\n\n## Stripe fees\n\nThere are two components to Stripe fees with Connect: which pricing plan applies\nto the payment and which account pays Stripe fees.\n\nWhen using Direct charges, you can choose how Stripe fees are billed to your\nconnected accounts.\n\n[Read more about fee billing behaviors with Direct\ncharges.](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges-fee-payer-behavior)\n\nDestination charges and separate charges and transfers typically use the\nplatform’s pricing plan and are assessed on the platform. When the\n`on_behalf_of` field is set, the country of the connected account is used to\ndetermine the country specific fees charged to your platform account.\n\nFor more information on Connect fees and how to request custom pricing, please\nsee [Connect pricing](https://stripe.com/connect/pricing).\n\n## Refunds\n\nYou can issue a [refund](https://docs.stripe.com/api/refunds) to pay back the\nmoney spent on the returned good or to compensate for unsatisfactory service.\nBelow describes how refunds are handled for each charge type:\n\nCharge Types Pending RefundsDirect chargesIf the connected account’s balance is\nsufficiently negative at [creation\ntime](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#issue-refunds), the\n`refund` object is set to a status of `pending`. When enough funds are available\nin the connected account’s balance, Stripe automatically processes any refunds\nwith a `pending` status and updates the status to `successful`.Separate charges\nand transfersIf the connected account’s balance and your platform’s account\nbalance are sufficiently negative at [creation\ntime](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers#issue-refunds),\nthe `refund` object is set to a status of `pending`. When enough funds become\navailable in your connected account’s or platform’s balance, Stripe\nautomatically processes the refunds with a `pending` status and updates their\nstatus to `successful`.\n**Destination charges**\n\nIf your platform’s account balance is sufficiently negative at [creation\ntime](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges#issue-refunds), the\n`refund` object is set to a status of `pending`. When enough funds become\navailable in your platform’s balance, Stripe automatically processes the refunds\nwith a `pending` status and updates their status to `successful`.\n\nIf the connected account’s balance is sufficiently negative and a refund request\nalso attempts a transfer reversal, the refund request returns an error, instead\nof creating a refund with `pending` status.\n\n## Disputes and chargebacks\n\nFor disputes on payments created using [direct\ncharges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges), Stripe debits the\ndisputed amount from the connected account’s balance, not your platform’s\nbalance. Stripe can bill the dispute fee to either the platform or the connected\naccount, depending on the connected account’s configuration. For more detail\nabout how we bill fees for disputes on direct charges, see [Fee behavior on\nconnected\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges-fee-payer-behavior).\n\nFor disputes where payments were created on your platform using [destination\ncharges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges) or [separate\ncharges and\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers), with\nor without `on_behalf_of`, your platform balance is automatically debited for\nthe disputed amount and fee. When this happens, your platform can attempt to\nrecover funds from the connected account by reversing the transfer either\nthrough the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/transfers) or by\n[creating a transfer\nreversal](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_transfer_reversal).\n\n#### Caution\n\nCreating payments using destination charges or separate charges or transfers,\nwith or without `on_behalf_of`, always debits refund and disputed amounts from\nyour platform balance, even when [Stripe is liable for negative\nbalances](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/risk-management) on your connected\naccounts.\n\nIf there’s a negative balance on the connected account, Stripe attempts to debit\nthe external account on file for the connected account only if\n`debit_negative_balances` is set to `true`.\n\nFor more details, see [Disputes and fraud](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes) and\n[Dispute categories](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/categories). You can also\nuse [Fraud Stripe Apps](https://marketplace.stripe.com/categories/fraud) to\nautomate dispute management and handle chargebacks.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Create direct charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges)\n- [Create destination\ncharges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges)\n- [Create separate charges and\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n- [Set statement\ndescriptors](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/statement-descriptors)\n- [Supported payment\nmethods](https://stripe.com/payments/features#local-payment-methods)\n- [Integrate tax calculation and\ncollection](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/connect)\n\n## Links\n\n- [platform profile](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/settings/profile)\n- [Direct charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges)\n- [Destination charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges)\n- [Separate charges and\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n- [card_payments\ncapability](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities#card-payments)\n- [settlement\nmerchant](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges#settlement-merchant)\n-\n[on_behalf_of](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-on_behalf_of)\n- [Cross-border\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities#transfers-cross-border)\n- [Express](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/express-accounts)\n- [Custom](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom-accounts)\n- [account balance](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-balances)\n- [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)\n- [currency\nconversions](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/currencies#currency-conversions)\n- [connected account’s statement\ndescriptor](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/statement-descriptors)\n- [Read more about fee billing behaviors with Direct\ncharges.](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges-fee-payer-behavior)\n- [Connect pricing](https://stripe.com/connect/pricing)\n- [refund](https://docs.stripe.com/api/refunds)\n- [creation time](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#issue-refunds)\n- [creation\ntime](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers#issue-refunds)\n- [creation\ntime](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges#issue-refunds)\n- [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/transfers)\n- [creating a transfer\nreversal](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_transfer_reversal)\n- [Stripe is liable for negative\nbalances](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/risk-management)\n- [Disputes and fraud](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes)\n- [Dispute categories](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/categories)\n- [Fraud Stripe Apps](https://marketplace.stripe.com/categories/fraud)\n- [Supported payment\nmethods](https://stripe.com/payments/features#local-payment-methods)\n- [Integrate tax calculation and\ncollection](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/connect)",
