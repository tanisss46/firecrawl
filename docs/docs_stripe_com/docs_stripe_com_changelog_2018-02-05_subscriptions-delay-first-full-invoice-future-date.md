# Subscriptions can now delay the first full invoice to a future date (and optionally include a free trial)Breaking changes

## What’s new

Allows a new subscription’s first full invoice to be on a future date by
specifying `billing_cycle_anchor`, with an optional proration up to that date.
`billing_cycle_anchor` on its own is available retroactively to past versions.
Starting in this version, you can combine `billing_cycle_anchor` with a trial,
enabling a free trial to be followed by a prorated period, followed by a fixed
billing cycle.

## Impact

Lets you set a future date for a new subscription’s first full invoice using
`billing_cycle_anchor`, with optional prorations. It enables more flexible
subscription management by allowing combinations of trials, prorated periods,
and fixed billing cycles.
