Because these settings are\nhierarchical, you can apply a configuration at either the account level or at\nthe individual location level. You can set configurations in the following ways:\n\n- On individual [Locations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/locations):\nApplies to all readers registered to that Location\n- At the account level: Applies to all readers in your fleet\n\nYou can override account-level settings with location-level settings. If you\ndon’t configure settings at the location level, they inherit the account-level\nsettings.\n\n#### Note\n\nWe don’t support assigning or adding configurations to zones.\n\nFor example, you can model your `Configuration` objects as follows:\n\n![Configuration\nHierarchy](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/configuration-object-tree.5ec745ad57500a800c4f34f0a970224e.png)\n\nIn this scenario, Location 3 inherits the configurations from the account\n“Default configuration”, while Locations 1 and 2 have their own configuration.\n\n#### Note\n\nIf you don’t set a configuration on the location-level, the Location inherits\nthe default configuration on the account. For example, if you don’t set the\nsplash screen on the Location, it inherits it from the default configuration set\nat the account level.\n\nAny configuration changes made with the API or Dashboard can take up to 10\nminutes to reflect on the target readers.\n\nDashboardAPI\nYou can view and manage your configurations in the Stripe Dashboard. To manage\nyour configurations, click **Manage locations** on the Readers tab. Stripe\ndisplays a list of configurations on the right hand side of the page. To view\nadditional configurations, click **View more** at the bottom of the list.\n\n## Update the default configuration for the account\n\n- Select the overflow menu () on the **All locations** list item (top).\n- Click **Edit configuration**.\n- Click **Override** for each configuration type you want to update.\n- Click **Apply changes**.\n\nAll readers across all locations inherit the configuration settings that you\nset, unless there’s an override set on the configuration for the location. The\nreader updates within 10 minutes after you add the configuration.\n\n## Create a new configuration for a location\n\n- Select the overflow menu () on the location item.\n- Click **Add configuration**.\n- Enter a name for the configuration. You can use this name more than once.\n- Click **Override** for each configuration type you want to update.\n- Click **Apply changes**.\n\nAll readers in the location inherit the configuration settings that you set. The\nreader updates within 10 minutes after you add the configuration.\n\n## Update an existing configuration\n\n- Select the overflow menu () on either the location list item (left side) or\nthe configuration itself (right side).\n- Click **Edit configuration**.\n- Click **Override** for each configuration type you want to update.\n- Click **Apply changes**.\n\nAll the readers in the location update within 10 minutes.\n\n## Delete an existing configuration\n\n- Select the overflow menu () on either the location list item (left side) or\nthe configuration itself (right side).\n- Click **Delete configuration**.\n\nAfter you delete the configuration, the readers in the location default back to\nthe account’s default configuration within 10 minutes.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Configuration](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/configuration)\n- [Locations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/locations)",
