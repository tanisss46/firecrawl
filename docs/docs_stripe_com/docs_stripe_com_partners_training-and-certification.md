# Stripe certification for partners

## Become a Stripe-certified architect or developer.

We offer two types of Stripe certifications that to partners: architect and
developer. Partners can achieve associate or professional-level certifications
for each type. Stripe certifications let partners gain Stripe expertise and
leverage their knowledge with in-depth training. After completing the
[additional requirements](https://docs.stripe.com/partners#requirements), these
certifications can also help you become a [Stripe verified
partner](https://docs.stripe.com/partners#verified-partners). Regardless of the
[partner track](https://docs.stripe.com/partners#partner-tracks), all partners
can complete certifications.

To become a verified services partner, partners need two certifications, one of
which must be a professional-level certification (the other can be associate or
professional-level).

also offers optional training for sales teams to learn the fundamentals of
online payments, how Stripe products address business needs, and how to go to
market with Stripe.
