This first currency is the price’s\ndefault currency. Make sure all of your prices have the same default currency.\n- Click **+Add a price by currency** to search and select from supported\ncurrencies, adding them to your price.\n- Use the multi-currency price you created by passing its ID into [line\nitems](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-line_items-price)\nwhen you create a Checkout Session.\n[Create a Checkout\nSessionServer-side](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/manual-currency-prices#create-checkout-session)\nCreate a Checkout Session using the multi-currency price:\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/checkout/sessions \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d \"line_items[0][price]\"={{PRICE_ID}} \\\n -d \"line_items[0][quantity]\"=1 \\\n -d mode=payment \\\n --data-urlencode success_url=\"https://example.com/success\"\n```\n\n[TestingServer-sideClient-side](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/manual-currency-prices#testing)\nTo test local currency presentment for Checkout, Payment Links, and the [pricing\ntable](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/pricing-table), pass in a\nlocation-formatted customer email that includes a suffix in a `+location_XX`\nformat in the local part of the email. `XX` must be a valid [two-letter ISO\ncountry code](https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/country_code_list.htm).\n\nFor example, to test currency presentment for a customer in France, pass in an\nemail such as `test+location_FR@example.com`.\n\nWhen you visit the URL for a Checkout Session, Payment Link, or pricing table\ncreated with a location-formatted email, you see the same currency as a customer\ndoes in the specified country.\n\n### Testing Checkout\n\nWhen you create a Checkout Session, pass the location-formatted email as\n[customer_email](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object#checkout_session_object-customer_email)\nto simulate Checkout from a particular country.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/checkout/sessions \\\n -u sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2: \\\n -d \"line_items[0][price]\"={{PRICE_ID}} \\\n -d \"line_items[0][quantity]\"=1 \\\n -d mode=payment \\\n -d success_url=\"https://example.com/success\" \\\n --data-urlencode customer_email=\"test+location_FR@example.com\"\n```\n\nYou can also create a [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/create)\nand specify their email that contains the `+location_XX` suffix. Stripe test\ncards work as usual.\n\nWhen it’s possible to present the customer’s local currency in Checkout, the\n[Checkout Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object) object\nchanges. Fields like `currency`, `payment_method_types`, and `amount_total`\nreflect the local currency and price.\n\n### Testing Payment Links\n\nFor Payment Links, pass the location-formatted email as the `prefilled_email`\n[URL\nparameter](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links/customize#customize-checkout-with-url-parameters)\nto test currency presentment for customers in different countries.\n\n### Testing Pricing table\n\nFor the pricing table, pass the location-formatted email as the\n[customer-email](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/pricing-table#customer-email)\nattribute to test currency presentment for customers in different countries.\n\n[OptionalSpecify a\ncurrencyServer-side](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/manual-currency-prices#specify-currency)\n## Local payment methods\n\nThe Checkout Session presents customers with popular payment methods compatible\nwith their local currencies. For example, for customers located in the\nNetherlands, the Checkout Session converts prices to EUR and also present\npopular Dutch payment methods like iDEAL.\n\nYou can configure which payment methods you accept in your [payment methods\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods).\n\n## Pricing tables\n\nManual currency prices also work with [pricing\ntables](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/pricing-table). To render\nlocal currencies to customers viewing your pricing table, all of the pricing\ntable’s Prices must include the customer’s local currency in their\n`currency_options`. They must also include a `tax_behavior` for the given\ncurrency if you’re using Stripe Tax.\n\n## Supported integrations\n\nCheckout automatically presents the local currency to customers if all of the\nfollowing are true:\n\n- The Checkout Session’s prices, shipping rates, and discounts have the relevant\ncurrency in their `currency_options`.\n- If a price on the Checkout Session has an upsell, the upsell’s price has the\nrelevant currency in its `currency_options`.\n- For a Checkout Session using Stripe Tax, the `tax_behavior` on the Checkout\nSession is specified for the relevant currency for all of the Checkout Session’s\nprices, shipping rates, and discounts.\n- You didn’t specify a currency during Checkout Session creation.\n\nIf Checkout can’t localize the currency because the relevant currency option or\n`tax_behavior` is missing, the Session presents to the customer in the default\ncurrency. The default currency must be the same across all prices, shipping\nrates, and discounts.\n\n### Restrictions\n\nPrice localization isn’t available for Checkout Sessions that:\n\n- Use manual tax rates.\n- Use `payment_intent_data.application_fee_amount` or\n`payment_intent_data.transfer_data.amount`.\n\n## Fees\n\nStripe’s standard transaction fees apply to automatically converted\ntransactions:\n\n- Cards or payment methods fee\n- International cards or payment methods fee (if applicable)\n- Currency conversion fee\n\nSee the [pricing page](https://stripe.com/pricing) for more details about these\nfees.\n\n## Links\n\n- [products](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/overview#get-started)\n- [Adaptive Pricing](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/adaptive-pricing)\n-\n[supported](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/adaptive-pricing#restrictions)\n- [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/products?active=true)\n- [line\nitems](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-line_items-price)\n- [https://example.com/success](https://example.com/success)\n- [pricing table](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/pricing-table)\n- [two-letter ISO country\ncode](https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/country_code_list.htm)\n-\n[customer_email](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object#checkout_session_object-customer_email)\n- [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/create)\n- [Checkout Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object)\n- [URL\nparameter](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links/customize#customize-checkout-with-url-parameters)\n-\n[customer-email](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/pricing-table#customer-email)\n- [payment methods\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods)\n- [pricing page](https://stripe.com/pricing)",
