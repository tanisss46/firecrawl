View the following\nintegration paths based on your requirements, and some common use cases for\nFinancial Connections data below.\n\nHow you integrate Financial Connections depends on your desired use cases.\n\nUse caseExampleRecommended integration[ACH Direct Debit\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/use-cases#ach-direct-debit)-\nBank-based payments\n- Wallet transfers and top-ups\n- Bill payments\nAn ACH payments integration:- [Setup\nIntents](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents)\n- [Payment Intents](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents)\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout)\n- [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing)\n[Connect\npayouts](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/use-cases#custom-connect-payouts)-\nPay out funds to Connected Accounts\nA Connect onboarding integration:- [Hosted\nonboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/payouts-bank-accounts?bank-account-collection-integration=prebuilt-web-form)\n- [Setup\nIntents](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/payouts-bank-accounts?bank-account-collection-integration=direct-api#create-a-setup-intent)\n[Building financial\nproducts](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/use-cases#building-other-products)-\nFinancial management application\n- Wealth management application\n- Loan underwriting\n[Financial Connections\nSessions](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions/object)\nTo process ACH payments or facilitate Connect payouts, use a recommended\npayments integration in the table above, such as Setup Intents. This makes sure\nthat the collected accounts are compatible with [ACH\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ach-direct-debit).\n\nThe Financial Connections Sessions API provides more flexibility for use cases\nthat won’t use the collected accounts for ACH payments or Connect payouts. It\nhas configuration options that let your users link additional [account\ntypes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/accounts/object#financial_connections_account_object-category)\nthat aren’t compatible with ACH, and you can collect multiple accounts in a\nsingle session.\n\nRegardless of which API you choose to integrate with, you can request access to\nadditional data on your users’ financial accounts. You can then use this data to\noptimize your integration or create more complex products. The following\nsections provide more context on the above use cases, including recommendations\non which data to access.\n\n## ACH Direct Debit payments\n\nIn accordance with [Nacha\nregulations](https://support.stripe.com/questions/nacha-bank-account-validation-rule),\nyou must verify a user’s account to accept an ACH Direct Debit payment or\ntransfer. With Financial Connections, your customer authenticates their bank\naccount and provides permission to share the details you need to charge their\naccount, such as a tokenized account and routing number.\n\nCollecting bank account details from a customer with Financial Connections can\nhelp you:\n\n- Improve payment reliability by verifying that a user’s bank account is open\nand able to accept ACH direct debits.\n- Increase checkout conversion by eliminating the need for your customers to\nleave your website or application to locate their account and routing numbers.\n- Save development time by eliminating the need for you to build bank account\nform validation when your customer enters account details.\n\nTo verify a bank account to accept an ACH Direct Debit payment with Financial\nConnections, use Stripe’s Payment Intent or Setup Intent APIs. Alternatively,\nyou can use a hosted Stripe payments integration such as\n[Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout) or the [Payment\nElement](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element).\n\nLearn how to [collect a bank account to accept an ACH Direct Debit\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/ach-direct-debit-payments).\n\nOptionally, you can request permission from your customers to retrieve\nadditional data on their [Financial Connections\naccount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/accounts/object). We\nrecommend that you access\n[balances](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/balances) data to\nperform balance checks prior to processing the payment.\n\nManual account entry and microdeposit verification are available as a fallback\nmethod for this use case. However, accounts that you add through microdeposits\nwon’t have access to additional account data.\n\n## Custom Connect payouts\n\nUse Financial Connections with Connect to verify bank accounts for Custom\nconnected accounts, thereby facilitating payouts. This allows your connected\naccount to authenticate its own bank account and provide permission to share\ndetails you need for payouts, like tokenized account and routing numbers.\n\nCollecting account details from your connected account with Financial\nConnections can help you:\n\n- Increase onboarding conversion by eliminating the need for your connected\naccount to leave your website or application to locate their account and routing\nnumbers.\n- Reduce first payout failure rates by eliminating errors that result from\nmanual entry of account and routing numbers.\n- Make sure you don’t need to store sensitive data such as account and routing\nnumbers on your server.\n- Save development time by eliminating the need for you to build bank account\nform validation when your connected account enters their bank account details.\n\nOptionally, you can request permission from your connected account to retrieve\nadditional data on their Financial Connections account. Consider accessing\n[ownership](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/ownership) details to\noptimize your onboarding process. Retrieving ownership data on an account can\nhelp you mitigate fraud by verifying an account’s ownership details, such as the\nname and address of the account holder.\n\nLearn how to [collect a bank account to initiate payouts to a US Custom Connect\naccount](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/connect-payouts).\n\nManual account entry and microdeposit verification are available as a fallback\nmethod for this use case (for example, if your connected account can’t find\ntheir institution or otherwise authenticate). However, accounts that you add\nthrough microdeposits won’t have access to additional account data.\n\n## Build financial products\n\nUse Financial Connections to access external bank account data that you can use\nto build financial products.\n\nAfter your user has consented to share data from their financial accounts, you\ncan retrieve data for various use cases, such as:\n\n- Help your user track expenses, handle bills, manage their finances and take\ncontrol of their financial well-being with\n[transactions](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/transactions) data.\n- Speed up underwriting and improve access to credit and other financial\nservices with transactions and balances data.\n\nLearn how to [collect an account to access\ndata](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/other-data-powered-products)\nusing Financial Connections’ Sessions API.\n\nManual account entry and microdeposit verification aren’t available in the\nauthentication flow for this use case because the primary goal of collecting an\naccount is data accessibility.\n\nYou can [convert most previously linked Financial Connections accounts to\nPayment\nMethods](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/other-data-powered-products?platform=web#accept-ach-direct-debit).\nHowever, if your integration uses the Sessions API, the linked account might not\nbe compatible with ACH.\n\n## Links\n\n- [payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts)\n- [Link](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link)\n- [Setup Intents](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents)\n- [Payment Intents](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents)\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout)\n- [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing)\n- [Hosted\nonboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/payouts-bank-accounts?bank-account-collection-integration=prebuilt-web-form)\n- [Setup\nIntents](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/payouts-bank-accounts?bank-account-collection-integration=direct-api#create-a-setup-intent)\n- [Financial Connections\nSessions](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions/object)\n- [ACH transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ach-direct-debit)\n- [account\ntypes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/accounts/object#financial_connections_account_object-category)\n- [Balances](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/balances)\n- [Nacha\nregulations](https://support.stripe.com/questions/nacha-bank-account-validation-rule)\n- [Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element)\n- [collect a bank account to accept an ACH Direct Debit\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/ach-direct-debit-payments)\n- [Financial Connections\naccount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/accounts/object)\n- [Ownership](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/ownership)\n- [collect a bank account to initiate payouts to a US Custom Connect\naccount](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/connect-payouts)\n- [Transactions](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/transactions)\n- [collect an account to access\ndata](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/other-data-powered-products)\n- [convert most previously linked Financial Connections accounts to Payment\nMethods](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/other-data-powered-products?platform=web#accept-ach-direct-debit)",
