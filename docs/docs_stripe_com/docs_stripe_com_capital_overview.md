## Offer financing to your users through Stripe Capital.

Stripe Capital provides access to financing options for eligible users
processing payments through Stripe. Financing offers for eligible users are
available in the Stripe Dashboard or through participating Connect platforms.

[Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect) platforms can build a customized
financing program for their customers. Stripe manages the sourcing of funds,
underwriting, and assists with regulatory compliance, as overseen by our bank
partner.

All loans are issued by Celtic Bank unless otherwise stated.
