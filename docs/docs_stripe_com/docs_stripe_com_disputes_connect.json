The disputed funds are taken from their balance, not\nthe platform’s.\n\nFor connected accounts where your platform is [liable for negative\nbalances](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/risk-management) (including Custom and\nExpress accounts), you’re ultimately responsible for any disputes involving\nthose accounts.\n\nFor direct payments on connected accounts where your platform is liable for\nnegative balances, Stripe debits disputed amounts and fees from the connected\naccount’s balance. However, your platform is ultimately liable. If Stripe can’t\ndebit the disputed amount and fee from the connected account, Stripe debits it\nfrom your platform account.\n\n## Destination and separate charges and transfers\n\nFor [destination charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges)\nand [separate charges and\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers), with\nor without `on_behalf_of`, Stripe debits dispute amounts and fees from your\nplatform account.\n\nWe recommend setting up [a webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) to listen\nto [dispute created\nevents](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-charge.dispute.created).\nWhen that happens, you can attempt to recover funds from the connected account\nby reversing the transfer through the\n[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/transfers) or by [creating a\ntransfer reversal](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfer_reversals/create).\n\nIf the connected account has a negative balance, Stripe attempts to [debit its\nexternal\naccount](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-balances#automatically-debit-connected-accounts)\nif `debit_negative_balances` is set to `true`.\n\nIf you challenge the dispute and win, you can transfer the funds that you\npreviously reversed back to the connected account. If your platform has an\ninsufficient balance, the transfer fails. Prevent insufficient balance errors by\n[adding funds to your Stripe\nbalance](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/add-funds).\n\n#### Common mistake\n\nRetransferring a previous reversal is subject to [cross-border transfer\nrestrictions](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities#transfers-cross-border),\nmeaning you might have no means to repay your connected account. Instead, wait\nto recover disputed cross-border payment transfers for destination charges with\n`on_behalf_of` until after a dispute is lost.\n\nTo automate dispute management and handle chargebacks, browse [Fraud Stripe\nApps](https://marketplace.stripe.com/categories/fraud) on the App Marketplace.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Responding to disputes](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/responding)\n- [Dispute categories](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/categories)\n- [Preventing disputes and fraud](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention)\n- [Using Radar with Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/radar)\n\n## Links\n\n- [direct charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges)\n- [liable for negative\nbalances](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/risk-management)\n- [destination charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges)\n- [separate charges and\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n- [a webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks)\n- [dispute created\nevents](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-charge.dispute.created)\n- [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/transfers)\n- [creating a transfer\nreversal](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfer_reversals/create)\n- [debit its external\naccount](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-balances#automatically-debit-connected-accounts)\n- [adding funds to your Stripe\nbalance](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/add-funds)\n- [cross-border transfer\nrestrictions](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities#transfers-cross-border)\n- [Fraud Stripe Apps](https://marketplace.stripe.com/categories/fraud)\n- [Responding to disputes](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/responding)\n- [Dispute categories](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/categories)\n- [Preventing disputes and fraud](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention)\n- [Using Radar with Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/radar)",
