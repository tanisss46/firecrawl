  "content": "# Embedded onboarding\n\n## Provide your connected accounts a localized onboarding form that validates data.\n\nEmbedded onboarding is a highly themeable onboarding UI with limited Stripe\nbranding. You embed the [Account onboarding\ncomponent](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/supported-embedded-components/account-onboarding)\nin your platform application, and your connected accounts interact with the\nembedded component without ever leaving your application.\n\nThe component supports [Legal Entity\nSharing](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/legal-entity-sharing), which allows\nowners of multiple Stripe accounts to share business information between them.\nWhen they onboard an account, they can reuse that information from an existing\naccount instead of resubmitting it.\n\nEmbedded onboarding uses the [Accounts\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts) to read the requirements and generate\nan onboarding form with robust data validation, localized for all\nStripe-supported countries. In addition, embedded onboarding handles all:\n\n- Business types\n- Configurations of company representatives\n- Verification document uploading\n- Identity verification and statuses\n- International bank accounts\n- Error states\nSizeDesktopLocale (United States)This demo is read-only with limited\nfunctionality. Visit [furever.dev](https://furever.dev/) for a fully functional\ndemo.[Create an account and prefill\ninformationServer-side](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/embedded-onboarding#create-account)\nCreate a [connected account](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts) with the\ndefault\n[controller](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/create#create_account-controller)\nproperties. See [design an\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/design-an-integration) to learn\nmore about controller properties. Alternatively, you can create a connected\naccount by specifying an account\n[type](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/create#create_account-type).\n\nWith controller propertiesWith account type\n```\ncurl -X POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\"\n```\n\nIf you know the country for your connected account, you can provide that\ninformation when you create the account. The country defaults to the same\ncountry as your platform if not provided.\n\nTo request [capabilities](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities)\nfor your connected account, you can provide that information when you create the\naccount. Stripe’s onboarding UIs automatically collect the requirements for\nthose capabilities. To reduce onboarding effort, request only the capabilities\nyou need. If you omit capabilities, and your connected account has access to the\nfull Stripe Dashboard or the Express Dashboard, capabilities are automatically\nrequested. For accounts with access to the Express dashboard, Stripe-hosted\nonboarding uses the [Configuration\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/onboarding-options/countries)\nto request capabilities based on the account’s country.\n\nIf you have information about the account holder (like their name, address, or\nother details), you can proactively provide this when you\n[create](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/create) or\n[update](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/update) the account. Stripe-hosted\nonboarding asks the account holder to confirm the pre-filled information before\naccepting the [Connect service\nagreement](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/service-agreement-types). Providing\nmore information through the API reduces the number of prompts and enhances the\nonboarding flow for your connected account.\n\nAdditionally, if you onboard an account without its own website and your\nplatform provides the account with a URL, prefill the account’s\n[business_profile.url](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/create#create_account-business_profile-url).\nIf the account doesn’t have a URL, you can prefill its\n[business_profile.product_description](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/create#create_account-business_profile-product_description)\ninstead.\n\nWhen testing your integration, use [test\ndata](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/testing) to simulate different outcomes\nincluding identity verification, business information verification, payout\nfailures, and more.\n\n[Determine the information to\ncollect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/embedded-onboarding#info-to-collect)\nAs the platform, you must decide if you want to collect the required information\nfrom your connected accounts upfront or incrementally. Upfront onboarding\ncollects the `eventually_due` requirements for the account, while incremental\nonboarding only collects the `currently_due` requirements.\n\nUpfront onboarding Incremental onboarding Advantages- Entails a single request\nfor information (normally)\n- Creates fewer problems in receiving payouts and maintaining processing ability\n- Exposes potential fraudsters or connected accounts who refuse to provide\nrequired information later\n- Onboards connected accounts quickly\n- Results in higher onboarding rates\nDisadvantages- Onboarding connected accounts can take longer\n- Some legitimate new connected accounts might turn away due to the amount of\ninformation required before they complete the onboarding process\n- Creates a higher likelihood of disrupting business of an ongoing connected\naccount\n\nTo determine whether to use upfront or incremental onboarding, review the\n[required\ninformation](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information)\nfor the countries where your connected accounts are located to understand the\nrequirements that are eventually due. While Stripe tries to minimize any impact\nto connected accounts, requirements might change over time.\n\nFor connected accounts where you’re responsible for requirement collection, you\ncan customize the behavior of [future\nrequirements](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/handle-verification-updates) using\nthe `collection_options` parameter. Set\n[collection_options.future_requirements](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links/create#create_account_link-collection_options-future_requirements)\nto `include` to collect the account’s future requirements.\n\n[Customize the policies shown to your\nusers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/embedded-onboarding#customize-policies-shown-to-your-users)\nConnected accounts see Stripe’s service agreement and [Privacy\nPolicy](https://stripe.com/privacy) during embedded onboarding. Connected\naccount users who haven’t [accepted Stripe’s services\nagreement](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/service-agreement-types#accepting-the-correct-agreement)\nmust accept it on the final onboarding screen. Embedded onboarding also has a\nfooter with links to Stripe’s service agreement and [Privacy\nPolicy](https://stripe.com/privacy).\n\nFor connected accounts where the platform is responsible for requirement\ncollection, you have additional options to customize the onboarding flow, as\noutlined below.\n\n### Handle service agreement acceptance on your own\n\nIf you’re a platform onboarding connected accounts where you’re responsible for\nrequirement collection, you can [collect Terms of Service\nacceptance](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/updating-service-agreements#tos-acceptance)\nusing your own process instead of using the embedded account onboarding\ncomponent. If using your own process, the final onboarding screen only asks your\nconnected accounts to confirm the information they entered, and you must secure\ntheir acceptance of Stripe’s service agreement.\n\nEmbedded onboarding still has links to the terms of service (for example, in the\nfooter) that you can replace by [linking to your own agreements and privacy\npolicy](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/embedded-onboarding#link-to-your-own-agreements-and-privacy-policy).\n\n### Link to your agreements and privacy policy\n\nConnected accounts see the Stripe service agreement and [Privacy\nPolicy](https://stripe.com/privacy) throughout embedded onboarding. For the\nconnected accounts where you’re responsible for requirement collection, you can\nreplace the links with your own agreements and policy. Follow the instructions\nto [incorporate the Stripe services\nagreement](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/updating-service-agreements#adding-stripes-service-agreement-to-your-terms-of-service)\nand [link to the Stripe Privacy\nPolicy](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/updating-service-agreements#disclosing-how-stripe-processes-user-data).\n\n[Integrate the account onboarding\ncomponentServer-sideClient-side](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/embedded-onboarding#integrate-account-onboarding-component)\nCreate an [Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions) by\nspecifying the ID of the connected account and `account_onboarding` as the\ncomponent to enable.\n\n## Create an Account Session\n\nWhen [creating an Account\nSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions/create), enable account\nonboarding by specifying `account_onboarding` in the `components` parameter.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/account_sessions \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d account={{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}} \\\n -d \"components[account_onboarding][enabled]\"=true \\\n-d \"components[account_onboarding][features][external_account_collection]\"=true\n```\n\nAfter creating the Account Session and [initializing\nConnectJS](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components#account-sessions),\nyou can render the Account onboarding component in the front end:\n\n```\n// Include this element in your HTML\nconst accountOnboarding = stripeConnectInstance.create('account-onboarding');\naccountOnboarding.setOnExit(() => {\n console.log('User exited the onboarding flow');\n});\ncontainer.appendChild(accountOnboarding);\n\n// Optional: make sure to follow our policy instructions above\n// accountOnboarding.setFullTermsOfServiceUrl('{{URL}}')\n// accountOnboarding.setRecipientTermsOfServiceUrl('{{URL}}')\n// accountOnboarding.setPrivacyPolicyUrl('{{URL}}')\n// accountOnboarding.setSkipTermsOfServiceCollection(false)\n// accountOnboarding.setCollectionOptions({\n// fields: 'eventually_due',\n// futureRequirements: 'include',\n// })\n// accountOnboarding.setOnStepChange((stepChange) => {\n// console.log(`User entered: ${stepChange.step}`);\n// });\n```\n\nHTML +\nJSReactMethodTypeDescriptionDefault`setFullTermsOfServiceUrl``string`Absolute\nURL to your [full terms of\nservice](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/service-agreement-types#full)\nagreement.[Stripe’s full service\nagreement](https://stripe.com/connect-account/legal/full)`setRecipientTermsOfServiceUrl``string`Absolute\nURL to your [recipient terms of\nservice](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/service-agreement-types#recipient)\nagreement.[Stripe’s recipient service\nagreement](https://stripe.com/connect-account/legal/recipient)`setPrivacyPolicyUrl``string`Absolute\nURL to your privacy policy.[Stripe’s privacy\npolicy](https://stripe.com/privacy)`setSkipTermsOfServiceCollection``string`If\ntrue, embedded onboarding skips terms of service collection and you must\n[collect terms acceptance\nyourself](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/updating-service-agreements#indicating-acceptance).false`setCollectionOptions``{\nfields: 'currently_due' | 'eventually_due', future_requirements: 'omit' |\n'include' }`Customizes collecting `currently_due` or `eventually_due`\nrequirements and controls whether to include [future\nrequirements](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-future_requirements).\nSpecifying `eventually_due` collects both `eventually_due` and `currently_due`\nrequirements.`{fields: 'currently_due', futureRequirements:\n'omit'}``setOnExit``() => void`The connected account has exited the onboarding\nprocess`setOnStepChange``({step}: StepChange) => void`The connected account has\nnavigated from one step to another within the onboarding process.

For example, if there’s a typo\npreventing verification, onboarding prompts the connected account to upload an\nidentity document (such as a Driver’s License in the United States). If any\ninformation is missing, onboarding requests it.\n\nStripe notifies you about any [upcoming requirements\nupdates](https://support.stripe.com/user/questions/onboarding-requirements-updates)\nthat affect your connected accounts.
