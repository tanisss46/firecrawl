# Deferred PaymentIntent creation in Checkout Session payment modeBreaking changes

## What’s new

A PaymentIntent is no longer created during Checkout Session creation in payment
mode. Instead, a PaymentIntent is created when the Session is confirmed.

## Impact

Lets you create a PaymentIntent only when the Checkout Session is confirmed,
rather than having it created during the initial Checkout Session creation. This
provides more flexibility and control over the payment flow.
