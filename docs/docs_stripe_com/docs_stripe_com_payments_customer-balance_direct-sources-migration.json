If you currently integrate with ACH Credit Transfers, you must [migrate\nto the Payment Methods\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/transitioning).\n\nFor information about migrating to USD Bank Transfer supported by the current\nAPIs, refer to the documentation below.\n\nSee [Migrating from Sources-based Credit\nTransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/customer-balance/migrating-from-sources)\nif you want to learn about the reasons to migrate.\n\n## Before you begin\n\nConfirm if you’re currently using the legacy ACH Credit Transfers product:\n\n- Navigate to the list of payment methods in your [Payment Method\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods), and click the\n**Eligible** tab. If you don’t see ACH Credit Transfers in this list, you’re not\nusing the ACH Credit Transfer product.\n- If ACH Credit Transfers is displayed in the list of available payment methods,\ncheck to see if you pass the `ach_credit_transfer` payment method type when\nintegrating with the Sources API. If you’re not passing this payment method\ntype, you’re not using the ACH Credit Transfer product.\n\nIf you’re not using ACH Credit Transfers with the Sources or Charges API, you\ncan skip this guide because it doesn’t apply to you.\n\n[Activate USD bank\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/customer-balance/direct-sources-migration#activate-bank-transfers)\nTo turn on bank transfer payments, navigate to your [Payment methods\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods).\n\n[OptionalTest bank transfers with an individual\ncustomer](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/customer-balance/direct-sources-migration#activate-us-bank-transfers)\nBefore you migrate, you can test bank transfers:\n\n- Create a test customer with a Credit Transfer source attached. Complete the\nsteps in the integration guide of [ACH Credit\nTransfer](https://docs.stripe.com/sources/ach-credit-transfer). Save the bank\ndetails of the Source from the `ach_credit_transfer` field of the object to\nrefer to later.\n- Build the new Bank Transfers integration on Payment Intents by following the\n[Accept a\nPayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bank-transfers/accept-a-payment) guide\nwith the test customer you created above. Your integration now supports Bank\nTransfers on Payment Intents, while still supporting the existing implementation\non Sources.\n- After you [test and confirm that the integration\nworks](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bank-transfers/accept-a-payment?payment-ui=direct-api#test-your-integration),\nconfirm if the bank details of the Credit Transfer Source have been migrated.\nNavigate to the customer details page in the Dashboard, and then expand **Cash\nbalance**.\n- Click **View balance details** to find the funding instructions of the\ncustomer and confirm that they match the bank details of the Credit Transfer\nSource. You can also use the [Funding Instructions\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/customer-balance/funding-instructions) to\nget the funding instructions.\n[Drop the legacy\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/customer-balance/direct-sources-migration#drop-legacy-integration)\nAfter you verify that the migration works for individual customers in both test\nand live mode, remove your Sources or Charges API integration. You can now rely\nentirely on the Bank Transfers integration on Payment Intents.\n\n## Links\n\n- [migrate to the Payment Methods\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/transitioning)\n- [Migrating from Sources-based Credit\nTransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/customer-balance/migrating-from-sources)\n- [Payment Method\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods)\n- [ACH Credit Transfer](https://docs.stripe.com/sources/ach-credit-transfer)\n- [Accept a\nPayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bank-transfers/accept-a-payment)\n- [test and confirm that the integration\nworks](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bank-transfers/accept-a-payment?payment-ui=direct-api#test-your-integration)\n- [Funding Instructions\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/customer-balance/funding-instructions)",
