# Product release phases

## Learn how Stripe describes product release phases.

Stripe uses specifically-named release phases to describe the availability of
features in the Stripe API, Dashboard, and other product areas. These phases
enable us to incrementally release new features and improve them based on your
feedback.

Use the table below to learn more about each phase and what to expect.
