  "content": "# Stripe Payments and Tax Connector for Adobe Commerce\n\n## Enable Stripe payments for storefronts built on Adobe Commerce.\n\n[Install the\nmodule](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/adobe-commerce/payments/install) and\nthen go to the\n[configuration](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/adobe-commerce/payments/configuration)\nsection to set your preferred checkout flow and other options.\n\n## Accept online payments\n\nThe module offers two different flows for accepting payments in Adobe Commerce:\n\n- Embed the [Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element)\non your website (recommended).\n- Redirect to [Stripe Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout), a\npayment form hosted on Stripe.\n\nBoth options are optimized for conversion and SAQ-A eligible, simplifying [PCI\ncompliance](https://docs.stripe.com/security/guide#validating-pci-compliance).\n\n!\n\nEmbed the Payment Element\n\n!\n\nRedirect to Stripe Checkout\n\nYou can individually enable or disable payment methods from your [payment\nmethods settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods). This\napplies to both Stripe Checkout and the Payment Element. You don’t need to\nupgrade your integration after you enable a payment method, even if the payment\nmethod became available after you installed the Stripe Connector for Adobe\nCommerce.\n\n#### Note\n\nThe full list of supported payment methods is available in the [Payment method\nsupport](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/payment-method-support)\nguide.\n\nTo optimize conversions, Stripe Checkout and the Payment Element display payment\nmethods dynamically to adapt to the current session. The customer device,\nshipping country, cart currency and even cart contents are taken into\nconsideration to select and sort payment methods for conversion. For logged-in\ncustomers, we display their saved payment methods first to enable faster\ncheckout.\n\nYou can customize the look and feel of the Payment Element by overriding the\n`getElementOptions()` PHP method under `Model/Ui/ConfigProvider.php`. To do\nthis, implement an [afterMethod\nplugin](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/php/development/components/plugins/#after-methods).\n\n### Enable fraud prevention with Stripe Radar\n\n[Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) provides real-time fraud protection and\nrequires no additional development time. Fraud professionals can add [Radar for\nFraud Teams](https://stripe.com/radar/fraud-teams) to customize protection and\nget deeper insights.\n\nIf Radar detects a high-risk payment, it might place it under review with an\n**Elevated** risk status. If you want to automatically decline charges, you can\ncreate a custom rule in your Radar settings. Any orders that go into manual\nreview are automatically placed on hold in Adobe Commerce. You can configure\nwhat orders to send to manual review in your [Radar\nrules](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/radar/rules):\n\n!\n\nStripe Radar can detect and prevent fraud for orders placed on your site\n\nIf you think that an order isn’t fraudulent, you can click **Unhold** on the\norder page. That allows you to fulfill the order normally.\n\nTo test a fraudulent payment, switch the module to test mode and place an order\nusing the card number **4000 0000 0000 9235**.\n\n### Customer Authentication\n\n#### Note\n\nThe Stripe Connector for Adobe Commerce is\n[SCA-ready](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication) and includes\n[3D Secure 2](https://stripe.com/guides/3d-secure-2) support for customer\nauthentication.\n\nBy default, customers only see 3D Secure authentication when their bank requires\nit, so your checkout conversion isn’t negatively affected. In compliance with\nthe [Strong Customer\nAuthentication](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication)\nregulation, Stripe displays the 3D Secure authentication flow automatically\nwhenever required by SCA:\n\n!\n\nStripe provides a 3D Secure test payment page in test mode\n\nYou can configure your 3DS preferences in your [Radar\nrules](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/radar/rules).\n\nTo test the authentication flow, switch the module to test mode and place an\norder using any of the [test card\nnumbers](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure/authentication-flow#three-ds-cards).\n\n## Grow your recurring revenue with subscriptions\n\nOur module offers a subscription engine for Adobe Commerce that includes the\nfollowing features:\n\n- Configurable and customer-customizable subscription products in your catalog\npages.\n- Trial plans or the ability to collect initial fees with each subscription\npurchase.\n- Customer notifications and the collection of new payment details from Stripe\nBilling when subscription payments fail.\n- Reduced churn because Stripe works directly with card networks to\nautomatically update payment details with new card numbers or expiry dates.\n\n## Translations for multi-language websites\n\n#### Caution\n\nIf you configure your locale or currency for the first time, make sure to [flush\nthe configuration\ncache](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/config-guide/cli/config-cli-subcommands-cache.html#config-cli-subcommands-cache-clean).\n\nThe module contains a translation file that you can use to configure a\nmulti-language Adobe Commerce site:\n\n```\n/app/code/StripeIntegration/Payments/i18n/en_US.csv\n\n```\n\nTo create a translation file for a different language, copy this file to:\n\n```\n/app/code/StripeIntegration/Payments/i18n/languagecode_COUNTRYCODE.csv\n\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `languagecode_COUNTRYCODE` with the locale code for your\ntarget language. This is the same language you’ve selected under **System >\nConfiguration > General > Locale Options > Locale**.\n\nAfter you copy the file, you can replace the second string on each row with a\ntranslation of the first string. You don’t need to do anything else for\ntranslations.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Install the Stripe Connector for Adobe\nCommerce](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/adobe-commerce/payments/install)\n- [Configure the Stripe Connector for Adobe\nCommerce](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/adobe-commerce/payments/configuration)\n- [Enable subscriptions for Adobe Commerce\nproducts](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/adobe-commerce/payments/subscriptions)\n- [Use the Adobe Commerce admin\npanel](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/adobe-commerce/payments/admin)\n- [Build a custom\nstorefront](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/adobe-commerce/payments/custom-storefront)\n- [Version\nHistory](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/adobe-commerce/payments/versions)\n-\n[Troubleshooting](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/adobe-commerce/payments/troubleshooting)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Install the\nmodule](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/adobe-commerce/payments/install)\n-\n[configuration](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/adobe-commerce/payments/configuration)\n- [Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element)\n- [Stripe Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout)\n- [PCI\ncompliance](https://docs.stripe.com/security/guide#validating-pci-compliance)\n- [payment methods\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods)\n- [Payment method\nsupport](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/payment-method-support)\n- [afterMethod\nplugin](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/php/development/components/plugins/#after-methods)\n- [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar)\n- [Radar for Fraud Teams](https://stripe.com/radar/fraud-teams)\n- [Radar rules](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/radar/rules)\n- [SCA-ready](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication)\n- [3D Secure 2](https://stripe.com/guides/3d-secure-2)\n- [test card\nnumbers](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure/authentication-flow#three-ds-cards)\n- [flush the configuration\ncache](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/config-guide/cli/config-cli-subcommands-cache.html#config-cli-subcommands-cache-clean)\n- [Enable subscriptions for Adobe Commerce\nproducts](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/adobe-commerce/payments/subscriptions)\n- [Use the Adobe Commerce admin\npanel](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/adobe-commerce/payments/admin)\n- [Build a custom\nstorefront](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/adobe-commerce/payments/custom-storefront)\n- [Version\nHistory](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/adobe-commerce/payments/versions)\n-\n[Troubleshooting](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/adobe-commerce/payments/troubleshooting)",
