Below is a list of some common billing\nmodels. Click them to learn more:\n\n### Simple subscriptions\n\n### Metered billing subscriptions\n\n### Third-party recurring billing\n\n### Product bundles\n\n[Generate reports and\ncharts](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/get-started#generate-reports)\nBy default, the Dashboard displays all [Revenue Recognition reports and\ncharts](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/reports#dashboard) by\naccounting periods (which is defined as the start and end dates of a given\nmonth). It takes up to 24 hours for reports to generate and become available for\ndownload.\n\n#### Note\n\nIf you’d like to recognize revenue based on custom accounting periods such as\nthe 4-5-4 retail calendar, please [create a\nticket](https://support.stripe.com/contact/email?topic=financial_reports) on our\nsupport page to join our beta.\n\nBelow is a short summary of the reports and charts you can view, download, or\nboth.\n\nReports and chartsDescriptionRevenue overviewHigh-level bar graphs that show\nyour revenue activity (that is, your net recognized revenue and your ending\nbalance per month) over time.Monthly summaryDetails of the accounting activities\nfor the last month or a specified previous month.

See [Trial\nbalance](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/reports/trial-balance) for\nmore information.\nSometimes you’ll see mismatches between your accounting reports after you import\nthe data and set up Stripe.\n\n[Test your transaction\nmodel](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/get-started#test)\nUse a sandbox in the Dashboard to generate test revenue reports based on your\ntransactions.\n\nBefore going live, you can test the transaction model without your test\ntransactions. Create rules to exclude transactions from specific customers,\nproducts, invoices, or payments.\n\nFor example, you can exclude all revenues produced by a test customer, named\n`test@example.com`. [Create a\nrule](https://dashboard.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/rules/create) that\napplies to this customer and choose **Exclude revenue 100%** as the revenue\ntreatment.\n\n## Other considerations\n\nYou might need to handle other considerations like [tax\nrevenue](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/get-started#third-party-tax),\n[passthrough\nfees](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/get-started#passthrough-fees),\n[amortization\ngranularity](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/revenue-settings#amortization-granularity),\nand [catch-up\nrevenue](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/revenue-settings#catch-up-revenue).\nYou can further set up Revenue Recognition so Stripe can handle it for you.\n\n### Recognize tax revenue from third-party solutions\n\nYou can set up rules for Revenue Recognition to automatically calculate your tax\nrevenue if you’re not using Stripe Tax.\n\nFirst, set the tax amount to the\n[tax](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/taxes/tax-rates) parameter of an invoice\nor an invoice line item. Then, set up a rule to recognize the amount as tax. You\ncan track the revenue from tax in the reports under **Tax liability**.\n\nAs an example, say you’re using Avalara AvaTax to calculate sales tax for your\nproducts. You want to treat the invoice line item for `AvaTax` as tax so you\ncreate this rule:\n\nNameApply toTreatment`Recognize tax revenue from AvaTax`Invoices- **Line item\ndescription contains all of the following:** `AvaTax`\nTreat as tax- **Allocation** `100%`\n\n### Calculate passthrough fees\n\nYou can set up [rules](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/rules) so\nStripe can automatically calculate the passthrough fees and, separately, your\nrevenue on [invoice line items](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/line_item)\nor a portion of an invoice line item.\n\nFor example, say you have an invoice line item `Service A` that costs 100 USD.\nYou want to recognize 10 USD as passthrough fees and recognize 90 USD as\nrevenue, so you [create this\nrule](https://dashboard.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/rules/create):\n\nNameApply toTreatment\n`Service A includes passthrough fees`\n\n**Invoices**\n\n- **Line item description contains all of the following:** `Service A`\n\n**Defer upon event & amortize over line item service period**\n\n- **Allocation** `90%`\n- **Defer from finalized time and amortize over line item service period**\n\n**Treatment as passthrough fees**\n\n- **Allocation** `10%`\n\n### Adjust Revenue Recognition controls\n\nWhile Stripe Revenue Recognition is designed to work out-of-the-box for many\nbusiness types, we understand that each business might have unique needs. We\noffer advanced configurations on your revenue recognition reporting through our\n[Controls](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/revenue-settings) page,\nwhere you can easily adjust for settings like revenue amortization granularity\nand catch-up revenue treatment.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Subscriptions and Tax](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/taxes)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/revenue-recognition)\n- [sign up](https://dashboard.stripe.com/)\n- [sandbox](https://docs.stripe.com/sandboxes)\n- [create a\nticket](https://support.stripe.com/contact/email?topic=financial_reports)\n- [Revenue Recognition reports and\ncharts](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/reports#dashboard)\n- [Monthly\nsummary](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/reports/monthly-summary)\n- [Revenue\nwaterfall](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/reports/waterfall)\n- [Trial\nbalance](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/reports/trial-balance)\n- [Create a rule](https://dashboard.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/rules/create)\n- [amortization\ngranularity](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/revenue-settings#amortization-granularity)\n- [catch-up\nrevenue](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/revenue-settings#catch-up-revenue)\n- [tax](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/taxes/tax-rates)\n- [rules](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/rules)\n- [invoice line items](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/line_item)\n- [Controls](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/revenue-settings)\n- [Subscriptions and Tax](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/taxes)",
