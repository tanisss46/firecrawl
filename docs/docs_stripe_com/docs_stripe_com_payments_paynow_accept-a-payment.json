We\nrecommend that you configure your payment methods from the Stripe Dashboard\nusing the instructions in [Accept a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web&ui=stripe-hosted).\n\nIf you want to continue manually configuring the payment methods you present to\nyour customers with Checkout, use this guide. Otherwise, update your integration\nto [configure payment methods in the\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/dashboard-payment-methods).\n\nPayNow is a [single-use](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#usage)\npayment method. Customers pay with PayNow by scanning the QR code that they see\nduring Checkout. Completing the payment redirects customers back to your\nwebsite.\n\n[Determine\ncompatibility](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/paynow/accept-a-payment#compatibility)\nA Checkout Session must satisfy all of the following conditions to support\nPayNow payments:\n\n- [Prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices) for all line items must be in the\nsame currency, and must be in `sgd`.\n- You can only use one-time line items (PayNow Checkout Sessions donâ€™t support\nrecurring [subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating)\nplans).\n[Accept a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/paynow/accept-a-payment#accept-a-payment)\n#### Note\n\nThis guide builds on the foundational [accept a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?integration=checkout)\nCheckout integration.\n\nThis guides you through enabling PayNow and shows the differences between\naccepting a card payment and using PayNow.\n\n### Enable PayNow as a payment method\n\nWhen creating a new [Checkout\nSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions), you need to:\n\n- Add `paynow` to the list of `payment_method_types`\n- Make sure all your `line_items` use the same currency\n\n```\nStripe.api_key = 'sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2'\nStripe::Checkout::Session.create({\n mode: 'payment',\n payment_method_types: ['card'],\n payment_method_types: ['paynow'],\n # or you can take multiple payment methods with\n # payment_method_types: ['card', 'paynow', ...]\n line_items: [{\n price_data: {\n currency: 'sgd',\n product_data: {\n name: 'T-shirt',\n },\n unit_amount: 2000,\n },\n quantity: 1,\n }],\n success_url: 'https://example.com/success',\n cancel_url: 'https://example.com/cancel',\n})\n```\n\n### Fulfill your orders\n\nAfter accepting a payment, learn how to [fulfill\norders](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/fulfillment).\n\n## Test your integration\n\nWhen testing your Checkout integration, select PayNow as the payment method and\nclick the **Generate QR code** button, which creates and renders a QR code.\n\nWhile testing, you can scan the QR code with a QR code scanning application on\nyour mobile device. The QR code payload contains a URL which brings you to a\nStripe-hosted PayNow test payment page where you can either authorize or fail\nthe test payment.\n\nIn live mode, you will be able to scan the QR code using a preferred banking app\nor payment app that supports PayNow.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Checkout fulfillment](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/fulfillment)\n- [Customizing\nCheckout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/customization)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Accept a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web&ui=stripe-hosted)\n- [configure payment methods in the\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/dashboard-payment-methods)\n- [single-use](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#usage)\n- [Prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices)\n- [subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating)\n- [accept a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?integration=checkout)\n- [Checkout Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions)\n- [https://example.com/success](https://example.com/success)\n- [https://example.com/cancel](https://example.com/cancel)\n- [fulfill orders](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/fulfillment)\n- [Customizing\nCheckout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/customization)",
