# Transfers submitted to the bank that haven't arrived now provide an in_transit statusBreaking changes

## What’s new

Updates the `status` property on the `Transfer` object so that transfers not yet
submitted to the bank are still `pending` and transfers submitted to the bank
that haven’t yet arrived are `in_transit`. Previously, both states were
described as `pending`.

## Impact

The updated `status` property values help differentiate between pending and
in-transit transfers.
