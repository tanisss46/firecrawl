Connected accounts can select their offer amount and terms, view\ncontractual details, and submit their application.\n\nThis component is functionally similar to the [Capital financing\npromotion](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/supported-embedded-components/capital-financing-promotion)\ncomponent, but it invokes the application directly without including educational\nor promotional content. Use it to provide a different application entry point\nthan the Capital financing promotion component.\n\nSizeDesktopLocale (United States)This demo is read-only. Write operations\n(like performing a refund or saving account information) are not supported for\nthis demo.\n## Component lifecycle\n\n### Determining when to render the component\n\nTo determine whether a connected account has an eligible financing offer, call\nthe Capital [list Financing\nOffers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/capital/financing_offers/list) endpoint and\npass the connected account ID in the `connected_account` parameter.\n\nIf an account has no eligible financing offer, then the Capital financing\napplication component renders as null.\n\n### Post-submission\n\nIf a connected account has already submitted their financing application, the\nCapital financing application component renders an empty screen. We recommend\nthat you listen to the `onApplicationSubmitted` event to display a confirmation\nscreen.\n\n## Create an Account Session\n\nWhen [creating an Account\nSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions/create), enable the\nfinancing application component by specifying `capital_financing_application` in\nthe `components` parameter.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/account_sessions \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -H \"Stripe-Version: 2025-02-24.acacia; embedded_connect_beta=v2;\" \\\n -d account={{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}} \\\n -d \"components[capital_financing_application][enabled]\"=true\n```\n\nAfter creating the account session and [initializing\nConnectJS](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components#account-sessions),\nyou can render the Capital financing application component in the front end:\n\n```\n// Include this element in your HTML\nconst capitalFinancingApplication =\nstripeConnectInstance.create('capital-financing-application');\ncontainer.appendChild(capitalFinancingApplication);\n```\n\nHTML + JSReactMethodTypeDescriptionDefault`setOnApplicationSubmitted``() =>\nvoid`The connected account has successfully submitted their application for\nfinancing.`setPrivacyPolicyUrl``string`Absolute URL of a page containing your\nprivacy\npolicy.`https://stripe.com/privacy``setHowCapitalWorksUrl``string`Absolute URL\nof a page with information about the Capital\nprogram.`https://docs.stripe.com/capital/how-stripe-capital-works`\n\n## Links\n\n- [Capital financing\npromotion](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/supported-embedded-components/capital-financing-promotion)\n- [list Financing\nOffers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/capital/financing_offers/list)\n- [creating an Account\nSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions/create)\n- [initializing\nConnectJS](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components#account-sessions)",
