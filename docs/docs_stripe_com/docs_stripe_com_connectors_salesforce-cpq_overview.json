Inactive orders in Salesforce won’t be sent to Stripe for billing or\ncollections, by default.\n- All order quantities are integers and not fractional values.\n- All order amendments must co-terminate with the original order’s end date.\n- Any invoices in Stripe generated as a result of activating a Salesforce CPQ\norder won’t exist in Salesforce, by either creation or syncing. For Stripe to\nSalesforce syncing, see the [Stripe Connector for\nSalesforce](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/stripe-connector-for-salesforce/overview).\n\n## Install the connector\n\nThe connector is a managed package that you install from the [Salesforce\nAppExchange](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxListingDetail?listingId=a0N3A00000FOm4xUAD)\nonto your Salesforce account.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Set up the\nconnector](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/salesforce-cpq/setup)\n- [Field defaults and custom\nmappings](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/salesforce-cpq/field-mappings)\n- [Error\nhandling](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/salesforce-cpq/error-handling)\n\n## Links\n\n- [subscription\nschedule](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/subscription-schedules)\n- [invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/subscription)\n- [Stripe Dashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/dashboard/basics)\n- [Stripe Connector for\nSalesforce](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/stripe-connector-for-salesforce/overview)\n- [Salesforce\nAppExchange](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxListingDetail?listingId=a0N3A00000FOm4xUAD)\n- [Set up the\nconnector](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/salesforce-cpq/setup)\n- [Field defaults and custom\nmappings](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/salesforce-cpq/field-mappings)\n- [Error\nhandling](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/salesforce-cpq/error-handling)",
