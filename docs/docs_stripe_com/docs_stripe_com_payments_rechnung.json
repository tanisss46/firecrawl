When you accept payments on invoice with Stripe, as soon as a payment\nis approved we add the full payment amount, minus fees, to your Stripe balance.\nWe then send an invoice reflecting your branding to the customer. They must pay\nthe invoice within 14 days.\n\nTo pay using payment on invoice, a buyer enters their details (including name,\nemail, address, and date of birth). Using this data, a risk assessment is\ncarried out and, if approved by the assessment, the payment is authorized on\nStripe. The payment is then approved or declined based on the risk assessment\nresult and you receive an [immediate\nnotification](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#payment-notification)\nof the payment’s success or failure.\n\nPayment method propertiesCountry availability- **Customer locations**\n\nAustria, Germany\n- **Presentment currency**\n\nEUR\n- **Payment confirmation**\n\nCustomer-initiated\n- **Payment method family**\n\nBuy Now, Pay Later\n- **Payout timing**\n\n[Standard payout timing](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts#payout-speed) applies\n(minimum T+2)\n- **Notification timing**\n\n[Immediate\nnotification](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#payment-notification)\n- **Connect support**\n\nYes\n- **Recurring payments**\n\nNo\n- **Disputes**\n\nYes\n- **Refunds / Partial refunds**\n\nYes / Yes\n\n## Interested in getting early access to Payment on invoice?\n\nTo learn more or get early access, enter your email address below.
