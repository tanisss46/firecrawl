They\nchoose a funding source: PayPal wallet, linked card or bank account, or buy now,\npay later. Then they authenticate the payment. After successful authorization,\nthe customer is redirected back to your website. You receive an [immediate\nnotification](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#payment-notification)\nof the payment’s success or failure.\n\nPayment method propertiesBusiness locationsProduct support- **Customer\nlocations**\n\nWorldwide\n- **Presentment currency**\n\nEUR, GBP, USD, CHF, CZK, DKK, NOK, PLN, SEK, AUD, CAD, HKD, NZD, SGD\n- **Payment method family**\n\nWallets\n- **Payment confirmation**\n\nCustomer-initiated\n- **Payout timing**\n\n[Standard payout timing](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts#payout-speed) applies\n- **Connect support**\n\nPartial (requires manual approval, see details\n[below](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/paypal#connect))\n- **Recurring payments**\n\nRequires approval\n- **Dispute support**\n\n[Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/paypal#disputed-payments)\n- **Refunds / Partial refunds**\n\n[Yes / Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/paypal#refunds)\n\n## Payment flow\n\n!\n\n[Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers) selects PayPal at checkout\n\n!\n\nCustomer is redirected to PayPal and enters login details\n\n!\n\nCustomer completes authorization process\n\n!\n\nCustomer is notified that payment is complete\n\n!\n\n(Optional) Customer returns back to business’s site for payment confirmation\n\n## Connect\n\nPayPal is available for online marketplaces using [Stripe\nConnect](https://stripe.com/connect). These online marketplaces include\nbusinesses such as Deliveroo and ManoMano that collect payments from customers,\nand later pay out to sub-accounts or service providers. PayPal isn’t available\nfor platforms that onboard other businesses and enable them to accept payments\ndirectly, such as Shopify or Squarespace.\n\n#### Note\n\nOnline marketplaces need to submit an onboarding request from the [Stripe\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) to get access\nto PayPal. Stripe sends email updates about the progress of all requests, and\nthe current status is also reflected on the [Payment Method Settings\npage](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods).\n\nThe following [Connect charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges) types,\ntypically used by online marketplaces, are available to businesses using PayPal.\n\nDestination chargesSeparate charges and transfersDirect chargeson_behalf_of\n## Get started\n\nAdd PayPal and other payment methods from the [Stripe\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) without making\nupdates to your code. For each customer, Stripe determines the list of supported\npayment methods most likely to drive conversion. Learn how to [accept PayPal and\nother payment methods\nautomatically](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment) with Checkout\nor Elements. To accept PayPal and other payment methods without any code, use\n[Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links).\n\nWhen you’re ready to go live, follow the steps to [activate PayPal\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/paypal/activate).\n\n## Disputed payments\n\nCustomers must authenticate payments with their PayPal accounts, helping to\nreduce the risk of fraud or unrecognized payments. However, customers can still\ndispute transactions after they complete payment. Some common reasons for\ndisputes are customers determining that items weren’t as described, or not\nreceiving items at all. You can submit evidence to contest a dispute directly\nfrom the Stripe Dashboard.\n\nLearn how to [manage PayPal\ndisputes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/paypal/disputed-payments) in the\nDashboard.\n\nFor certain dispute types, PayPal enables you communicate directly to customers\nto try resolving the dispute. Contacting customers directly must be handled\nthrough the PayPal dashboard, and not the Stripe Dashboard.\n\n## Refunds\n\nPayPal payments can be refunded up to 180 days after the original payment.\nStripe uses either your Stripe balance or your PayPal balance to refund the\npayment, depending on the [settlement preference you\nselected](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/paypal/choose-settlement-preference).\n\nYou can use the Stripe Dashboard or API to initiate refund requests, as with\nother payment methods. If you choose to settle funds to Stripe, refunds will be\nwithdrawn from the funds available in your Stripe account. If you choose to\nsettle funds to PayPal, refunds funded using your PayPal balance or any other\nfunding source available on your PayPal account.\n\n## Reporting\n\nPayPal fees are included in the **Less fees** sections of [Balance and Balance\nActivity reports](https://dashboard.stripe.com/reports/balance). PayPal fees\naren’t included in your [tax invoice from\nStripe](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/documents). You can access these\ndocuments from your PayPal dashboard.\n\n## Seller protection\n\nPayPal’s Seller Protection program offers coverage for sellers under eligible\ntransactions. It includes scenarios such as unauthorized transactions or buyers’\nclaims of non-receipt of item. For more information on the Seller Protection\nprogram and eligibility, visit [PayPal Seller\nProtection](https://www.paypal.com/uk/legalhub/seller-protection).\n\n## Prohibited business categories\n\nIn addition to the business categories restricted from using Stripe overall,\nPayPal requires pre-approval to accept payments for certain services. Refer to\nthe [PayPal Acceptable Use\nPolicy](https://www.paypal.com/us/legalhub/acceptableuse-full) for details.\n\n## Minimum and maximum charge amounts\n\nPayPal doesn’t have a minimum charge amount, but Stripe enforces the same\n[minimum and maximum charge\namounts](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts)\nfor PayPal as for other payment methods.\n\n## Links\n\n- [immediate\nnotification](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#payment-notification)\n- [Standard payout timing](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts#payout-speed)\n- [below](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/paypal#connect)\n- [Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/paypal#disputed-payments)\n- [Yes / Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/paypal#refunds)\n- [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers)\n- [Stripe Connect](https://stripe.com/connect)\n- [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods)\n- [Connect charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges)\n- [accept PayPal and other payment methods\nautomatically](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment)\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n- [activate PayPal payments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/paypal/activate)\n- [manage PayPal\ndisputes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/paypal/disputed-payments)\n- [settlement preference you\nselected](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/paypal/choose-settlement-preference)\n- [Balance and Balance Activity\nreports](https://dashboard.stripe.com/reports/balance)\n- [tax invoice from Stripe](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/documents)\n- [PayPal Seller\nProtection](https://www.paypal.com/uk/legalhub/seller-protection)\n- [PayPal Acceptable Use\nPolicy](https://www.paypal.com/us/legalhub/acceptableuse-full)\n- [minimum and maximum charge\namounts](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts)",
