  "content": "# Regulatory receipts\n\n## Learn about hosted transaction receipts.\n\nAll changes to a balance have a corresponding [Transaction\nobject](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transactions/object) that provides\na summary of money movements. Some transaction types are considered *regulated*\nunder Stripe’s money transmission licenses and require special treatment. You,\nthe platform, must offer a transaction receipt and present disclosures to the\ncustomers of the sellers and service providers (connected accounts) on the\nplatform taking part in regulated transactions.\n\n## Providing access to receipts\n\nStripe provides hosted regulatory transaction receipts on all of our money\nmovement resources, recording the URL as the value for the\n`hosted_regulatory_receipt_url` attribute. This hosted receipt includes a\ndescription of the transaction, amount, timing information, and relevant\ndisclosures. Because the sellers and service providers (connected accounts) on\nyour platform don’t have Stripe Dashboard access, you must provide them with the\nability to retrieve receipts from within the product.\n\n![Hosted receipt of an outbound payment showing transaction id, amount sent,\ndate posted, description of transaction, and a regulatory disclosure\nmessage.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/receipt.4490fc802089baf86a8ee4bf9b98118a.png)\n\nRegulatory receipt\n\n#### Note\n\nDon’t store receipt URLs as they’re subject to change and only valid for 60\ndays.\n\nYou can find this hosted receipt in the `hosted_regulatory_receipt_url`\nattribute of the following objects:\n\n-\n[InboundTransfer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/inbound_transfers/object#inbound_transfer_object-hosted_regulatory_receipt_url)\n-\n[ReceivedCredit](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/received_credits/object#received_credit_object-hosted_regulatory_receipt_url)\n-\n[ReceivedDebit](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/received_debits/object#received_debit_object-hosted_regulatory_receipt_url)\n-\n[CreditReversal](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/credit_reversals/object#credit_reversal_object-hosted_regulatory_receipt_url)\n-\n[DebitReversal](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/debit_reversals/object#debit_reversal_object-hosted_regulatory_receipt_url)\n-\n[OutboundTransfer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/outbound_transfers/object#outbound_transfer_object-hosted_regulatory_receipt_url)\n-\n[OutboundPayment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/outbound_payments/object#outbound_payment_object-hosted_regulatory_receipt_url)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Transaction object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transactions/object)\n-\n[InboundTransfer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/inbound_transfers/object#inbound_transfer_object-hosted_regulatory_receipt_url)\n-\n[ReceivedCredit](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/received_credits/object#received_credit_object-hosted_regulatory_receipt_url)\n-\n[ReceivedDebit](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/received_debits/object#received_debit_object-hosted_regulatory_receipt_url)\n-\n[CreditReversal](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/credit_reversals/object#credit_reversal_object-hosted_regulatory_receipt_url)\n-\n[DebitReversal](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/debit_reversals/object#debit_reversal_object-hosted_regulatory_receipt_url)\n-\n[OutboundTransfer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/outbound_transfers/object#outbound_transfer_object-hosted_regulatory_receipt_url)\n-\n[OutboundPayment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/outbound_payments/object#outbound_payment_object-hosted_regulatory_receipt_url)",
