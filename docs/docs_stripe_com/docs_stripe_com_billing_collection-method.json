  "content": "# Billing collection methods\n\n## Configure your preferred method to collect on invoices and subscriptions.\n\nYou can set your preferred payment collection method when creating\n[invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices) and\n[subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating) using\neither the Dashboard or API.\n\n## Automatic charging versus manual payments\n\nThe collection method determines how Stripe processes the payment for both\nproducts. To collect payments for invoices and subscriptions, you can select\nfrom these methods:\n\n- Automatic charging\n- Manual payments\n\n#### Note\n\nManual payment methods, such as wire transfers, have more rigorous tracking and\nreconciliation processes, which [enterprise\nclients](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/collection-method#enterprise-clients-wire-transfers)\noften require for high transaction volumes. Some payment methods, such as [bank\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/bank-transfer), only support\n`send_invoice` and can’t be charged automatically.\n\n### Set a collection method for an invoice\n\nTo set a collection method for an invoice through the Invoicing API, use the\n[collection_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-collection_method)\nattribute.\n\n- `charge_automatically`: Lets you automatically charge a customer’s default\npayment method to pay invoices.\n- `send_invoice`: Sends an invoice for manual payment. Unlike automatic charging\nwhich requires immediate payment, you can give the customer an adjustable\npayment window. You can use the [Hosted Invoice\nPage](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/hosted-invoice-page) and set up [email\nnotifications and\nreminders](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/send-email#customer-emails) to\nfacilitate payment.\n\n### Set a collection method for a subscription\n\nTo set a collection method for a subscription through the Subscriptions API, use\nthe\n[collection_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-collection_method)\nattribute. If you change the collection method for a subscription, only\nsubsequently created subscription invoices use the new collection method.\n\n- `charge_automatically`: Tells Stripe to automatically charge your customer’s\ndefault payment method to pay the invoice generated for each subscription\nperiod.\n- `send_invoice`: Generates an invoice for each billing period, and requires\nmanual payment. Unlike automatic charging which requires immediate payment, you\ncan give the customer an adjustable payment window.\n\n#### Automatic charge for free trials without payment method\n\nYou can create a free trial for subscription without collecting payment method\nfrom your customers and still set the\n[collection_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-collection_method)\nattribute as `charge_automatically`. During the trial period, customers can [add\ntheir payment details using the Customer\nportal](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/trials#use-the-customer-portal-to-collect-payment).\nOnce the trial ends, customer’s default payment method will be automatically\ncharged. You can also configure your subscription to pause/cancel if the trial\nends without a payment method. Learn more about [creating free trials without\ncollecting payment\nmethod.](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/trials#create-free-trials-without-payment)\n\n## Collection methods and failed payments\n\nDepending on the collection method, failed payments generate different\n[subscription\nstatuses](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-status)\nand [invoice\nstatuses](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-status).\n\n### Failed subscription payments\n\nCreating a subscription with a\n[payment_behavior](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/create#create_subscription-payment_behavior)\nof `allow_incomplete`, and the `collection_method` set to\n`charge_automatically`, immediately attempts payment and marks the subscription\n`status` as `incomplete` if the initial payment attempt doesn’t succeed.\n\nPassing a `payment_behavior` of `default_incomplete` will always initialize\nsubscriptions with an `incomplete` status if the first invoice requires payment.\nThe resulting PaymentIntent must be confirmed in a separate request in order to\nattempt payment.\n\nFor both `allow_incomplete` and `default_incomplete`, the subscription becomes\n`active` after the first invoice is paid. Subscriptions that do not require\npayment upon creation (like those that are trialing) will immediately have a\nstatus of `active`. If the first invoice remains unpaid after 23 hours, the\nsubscription is set to `incomplete_expired`. This status is final and\nirreversible, voiding the open invoice and preventing future invoices.\n\n#### Failed incomplete subscriptions\n\nWhen a subscription has a status of `incomplete`, you can only update attributes\nthat won’t result in the creation of an invoice or invoice item, such as its\n[metadata](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-metadata),\n[save_default_payment_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-payment_settings-save_default_payment_method),\nand\n[description](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-description).\n\nIf a payment to renew the subscription fails when you’ve set it to charge\nautomatically, the subscription transitions to `past_due` and Stripe may mark it\nas `canceled` or `unpaid` (depending on your [subscriptions\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/automatic)) after Stripe\nexhausts all payment retry attempts.\n\nOn the other hand, if the subscription’s `collection_method` is set to\n`send_invoice`, it becomes `past_due` when its invoice remains unpaid by the due\ndate. If the customer still hasn’t paid the invoice after you extend the\ndeadline, Stripe may mark the subscription as `canceled` or `unpaid`, which\nagain depends on your subscription settings.\n\nWhen a subscription has a status of `unpaid`, Stripe creates future invoices but\nleaves them as drafts. In this case, you have the option to\n[resend](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/send) the `past due` invoice and\nany created draft invoices to collect payment. Use this feature if you’re trying\nto collect payment for unpaid months (such as when you continue to provide the\ngoods or services related to an unpaid subscription) or leave them closed and\nunpaid when you stop providing goods or services.\n\n### Failed invoicing payments\n\nInvoices not associated with subscriptions that have their `collection_method`\nset to `charge_automatically` and\n[auto-advancement](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection)\ndisabled, remain `open` if an initial payment attempt fails. Because\nauto-advancement is disabled, Stripe doesn’t automatically close the invoices,\nretry them, or transition them to a different status. Learn more about [failed\npayment\nnotifications](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/automatic-collection#failed-payment-notifications)\nand [managing invoices sent to\ncustomers](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/automatic-collection#manage-invoices-sent-customers).\n\nIf\n[auto-advancement](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection)\nis enabled for the invoice, Stripe may automatically mark the invoice as\n`uncollectible` (depending on your [invoice status\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/automatic)) after Stripe\nexhausts all payment retry attempts.\n\nWhen the collection method is set to `send_invoice`, the invoice requires manual\npayment. If the invoice remains unpaid past the due date, the status becomes\n`past_due`, indicating an overdue invoice. If you extend the payment deadline\nand the customer still hasn’t paid, you can leave the invoice as `past_due` or\ntransition it to `uncollectible` or `void`.\n\n## Enterprise clients and wire transfers\n\nFor enterprise clients, manual payment methods, such as wire transfers, offer\nsome advantages. These payment methods often involve more rigorous tracking and\nreconciliation processes compared to automated methods, which is crucial for\nenterprises that deal with high transaction volumes. By setting the\n`collection_method` to `send_invoice`, you can generate clear and\nwell-documented invoices that enterprise clients can pay using wire transfers—a\ncommonly preferred payment method for this type of client.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Automatic collection](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/automatic-collection)\n- [Automatic charging](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/automatic-charging)\n- [Subscription invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/subscription)\n- [Status transitions and\nfinalization](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/workflow-transitions)\n\n## Links\n\n- [invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n- [subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating)\n- [bank transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/bank-transfer)\n-\n[collection_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-collection_method)\n- [Hosted Invoice Page](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/hosted-invoice-page)\n- [email notifications and\nreminders](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/send-email#customer-emails)\n-\n[collection_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-collection_method)\n- [add their payment details using the Customer\nportal](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/trials#use-the-customer-portal-to-collect-payment)\n- [creating free trials without collecting payment\nmethod.](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/trials#create-free-trials-without-payment)\n- [subscription\nstatuses](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-status)\n- [invoice\nstatuses](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-status)\n-\n[payment_behavior](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/create#create_subscription-payment_behavior)\n-\n[metadata](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-metadata)\n-\n[save_default_payment_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-payment_settings-save_default_payment_method)\n-\n[description](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-description)\n- [subscriptions\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/automatic)\n- [resend](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/send)\n-\n[auto-advancement](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection)\n- [failed payment\nnotifications](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/automatic-collection#failed-payment-notifications)\n- [managing invoices sent to\ncustomers](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/automatic-collection#manage-invoices-sent-customers)\n- [Automatic collection](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/automatic-collection)\n- [Automatic charging](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/automatic-charging)\n- [Subscription invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/subscription)\n- [Status transitions and\nfinalization](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/workflow-transitions)",
