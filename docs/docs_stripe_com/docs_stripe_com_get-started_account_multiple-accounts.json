When you activate a new account, it’s\nsubject to Stripe’s standard policies and pricing—it doesn’t inherit any special\nstatus or other similar considerations that might apply to your existing\naccount.\n\n#### Note\n\nIf you operate multiple accounts related to the same business, such as for local\nacquiring or maintaining separate business lines, you can create an\n[organization](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/orgs) for centralized\nreporting and management.\n\nYou can create additional Stripe accounts associated with your email address.\nYou might create some accounts yourself, or you might be given access to other\naccounts as a [team member](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/teams).\nTo create a new account, click on the name of your current Stripe account in the\nupper-left corner, and select **New account**. To switch the account you’re\ncurrently viewing in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/), click on\nthe name of your current Stripe account in the upper-left corner and then select\nthe account to switch to.\n\nUsing additional accounts has a number of benefits:\n\n- **Separate tax and legal entity information**: You can only associate each\naccount with the tax ID and legal entity of one business. If you operate\nmultiple businesses that have separate tax ID information (for example, separate\nlegal entities), you must create additional accounts for each.\n- **Unique statement descriptor and public business information**: Using the\nsame Stripe account for separate businesses can cause confusion as the [public\nbusiness\ninformation](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/activate#public-business-information)\nused is the same for both. For example, a customer who purchases from your\nbusiness “XYZ” might see a charge from your business “ABC” on their statement,\npotentially resulting in a dispute. Each additional account has its own public\ninformation to accurately describe your business and payments.\n- **Reporting and reconciliation**: Separating the payments processed by your\nbusinesses helps you find payments, create and export\n[reports](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-reports), and reconcile payouts to your\nbank account.\n- **Payouts to separate bank accounts**: Each additional account can use a\nseparate bank account for [payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts) (although\nyou can use the same bank account if you want).\n\nWhen you have multiple projects or businesses that operate under the same legal\nentity, you can use the same tax ID and business information across multiple\naccounts. Make sure to provide suitable [public business\ninformation](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/activate#public-business-information)\nto avoid customer confusion.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Start a team](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/teams)\n- [User roles](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/teams/roles)\n\n## Links\n\n- [organization](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/orgs)\n- [team member](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/teams)\n- [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/)\n- [public business\ninformation](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/activate#public-business-information)\n- [reports](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-reports)\n- [payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts)\n- [User roles](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/teams/roles)",
