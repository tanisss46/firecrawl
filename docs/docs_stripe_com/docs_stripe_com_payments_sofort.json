It redirects them to their bank’s portal to authenticate the\npayment, and it typically takes 2 to 14 days to receive notification of success\nor failure.\n\n#### Caution\n\nYour use of Sofort must comply with our [Sofort Terms of\nService](https://stripe.com/sofort/legal).\n\nPayment method propertiesCountry availability- **Customer locations**\n\nEurope\n- **Presentment currency**\n\nEUR\n- **Payment confirmation**\n\nCustomer-initiated\n- **Payment method family**\n\nBank debit\n- **Recurring payments**\n\nvia SEPA Direct Debit\n- **Payout timing**\n\nStandard payout timing applies\n- **Connect support**\n\nYes\n- **Dispute support**\n\nNo\n- **Manual capture support**\n\nNo\n- **Refunds / Partial refunds**\n\nYes / yes\n\n## Payment flow\n\nBelow is a demonstration of the Sofort payment flow from your checkout page:\n\n## Get started\n\nYou don’t have to integrate Sofort and other payment methods individually. If\nyou use our front-end products, Stripe automatically determines the most\nrelevant payment methods to display. Go to the [Stripe\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and enable\nSofort. To get started with one of our hosted UIs, follow a quickstart:\n\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart): Our prebuilt, hosted\ncheckout page.\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart): Our drop-in UI\ncomponents.\n\n### Other payment products\n\nThe following Stripe products also let you add Sofort from the Dashboard:\n\n- [Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/no-code-guide)\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n\nIf you prefer to manually list payment methods or want to save Sofort details\nfor future payments, see the following guides:\n\n- [Manually configure Sofort as a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sofort/accept-a-payment)\n- [Save Sofort details for future\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sofort/set-up-payment)\n\n## Disputes\n\nThe risk of fraud or unrecognized payments is low because the customer must\nauthenticate the payment with their bank. As a result, you won’t have disputes\nthat turn into chargebacks, with funds withdrawn from your Stripe account.\n\n## Refunds\n\nSofort payments can be refunded up to 180 days after the original payment.\n\n## Links\n\n- [support\npage](https://support.stripe.com/questions/sofort-is-being-deprecated-as-a-standalone-payment-method)\n- [Payment Intents API](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents)\n- [Sofort](https://www.sofort.com/)\n- [single use](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#usage)\n- [delayed\nnotification](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#payment-notification)\n-\n[authenticate](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#customer-actions)\n- [Sofort Terms of Service](https://stripe.com/sofort/legal)\n- [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods)\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart)\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart)\n- [Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/no-code-guide)\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n- [Manually configure Sofort as a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sofort/accept-a-payment)\n- [Save Sofort details for future\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sofort/set-up-payment)",
