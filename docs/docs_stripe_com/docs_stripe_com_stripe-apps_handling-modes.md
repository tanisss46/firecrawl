# Handling different modesPublic preview

## Learn how to adapt your app to handle both live mode and test mode.

During installation, users can choose which mode to install your app into.

## Try it in test mode option

In the App Marketplace, potential users see a `Try in test mode` option to
encourage them to try out an app.

#### Caution

If your app uses the OAuth API access type or an external install url, the `Try
in test mode` option wonâ€™t be shown in the App Marketplace.

## Shortcut to install in opposite mode

If a user has one mode installed, you can install the other mode directly from
the Stripe Dashboard.

## Webhooks

If your app is set up to [listen to events for your installed users
accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/events), it requires additional
setup to make sure you can handle having your app installed in test mode.

If a user installs your app into live mode only, any applicable live mode events
are sent to your live mode webhook endpoints. If a user installs your app into
test mode only, any applicable test mode events are sent to your test mode
webhook endpoints. If a user installs your app into both live mode and test
mode, test mode events are sent to your test mode *and* live mode webhook
endpoints and live mode events are sent only to your live mode webhook
endpoints.

#### Note

We recommend that you set up both live mode and test mode webhook endpoints to
make sure that both modes are properly supported. See [event
behavior](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/build-backend#event-behavior-depends-on-install-mode)
for more information and examples about how the install mode affects event
behavior.

## OAuth test mode links

OAuth apps initiate app installation from within their platform. The developer
is responsible for implementing a test mode install link if you want test mode
support. The Stripe Dashboard provides a test mode OAuth install link.

The Stripe Apps OAuth documentation has more information on [creating OAuth
install
links](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/api-authentication/oauth#create-install-link).
