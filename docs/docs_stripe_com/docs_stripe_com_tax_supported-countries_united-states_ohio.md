Remote sellers must register to collect and remit tax in Ohio when, in the
previous or current calendar year, they do one of the following:

- Exceed a sales threshold of 100,000 USD
- Meet or exceed a volume threshold of 200 transactions

The thresholds include retail sales, including nontaxable sales of tangible
personal property and marketplace sales. The thresholds exclude wholesales
(sales of resale) and sales of nontaxable services.

registration](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/registering#track-your-registrations-in-the-tax-dashboard)
in the Dashboard.

## How we calculate taxes

If your [origin address](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/set-up#origin-address) is
in the US and differs from your customer’s state, Stripe always calculates tax
based on your customer’s location.

If your customer is in Ohio and your origin address is also in Ohio, Stripe
applies tax based on your origin address, depending on the type of product or
service you sell.

## Report and file your taxes

Stripe provides reports of your completed tax transactions. Go to
[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations) to access these
reports.

### Exports

The tax transaction data export provides a comprehensive and aggregated view of
transactions by location, including a breakdown of individual tax amounts. Learn
more about [tax reporting exports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports#exports).

### Location reports

[Location reports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports#us-location-reports)
offer a summary of transaction and refund data for specific US locations and
align with Ohio filing requirements. You have the option to report on an annual,
semiannual, or monthly basis.

### Filing

Stripe Tax has filing partners—Taxually, Marosa, and Hands-off Sales Tax
(HOST)—to help automate your tax filing. These partners automatically sync your
tax transaction data in real time, eliminating the need for manual data entry or
file transfers. Learn more about [tax
filing](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/filing).
