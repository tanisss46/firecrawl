Your point of sale application communicates with a\nreader through the Terminal SDK to collect in-person payments from your\ncustomers. Your backend works with your point of sale application to\nauthenticate the Terminal SDK and finalize payments.\n\n!\n\nBefore starting your own integration, we recommend setting up one of the\nTerminal example applications. This will give you a better feel for how the\ncomponents of a Terminal integration fit together and show you the interactions\nbetween the SDK, the reader, your point of sale application, and your backend\ncode.\n\n[Deploy the example\nbackend](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/example-applications#set-up-backend)\nTo get started with the example applications, set up the Sinatra-based [example\nbackend](https://github.com/stripe/example-terminal-backend) by following the\ninstructions in the\n[README](https://github.com/stripe/example-terminal-backend). You can either run\nthe backend locally or deploy it to Render with a free account. The example\nbackend works with the example application to authenticate the Terminal SDK and\nfinalize payments.\n\n[Run the example\napplication](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/example-applications#run-example-app)\nBuild and run one of the example applications:\n\nJavaScriptiOSAndroidReact Native- Clone the example from\n[GitHub](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-terminal-js-demo):\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/stripe/stripe-terminal-js-demo.git\n```\n\n- Run the following commands to run the example:\n\n```\ncd stripe-terminal-js-demo\nnpm install\nnpm run start\n```\n\n- In the running example, enter the URL of the example backend that you deployed\nin [step\n1](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/example-applications#set-up-backend).\n[Connect to a simulated\nreader](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/example-applications#connect-simulated-reader)JavaScriptiOSAndroidReact\nNative\nAfter you have the example running, select **Use simulator** to connect to a\n[simulated\nreader](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/references/testing#simulated-reader).\n\n!\n\nThe JavaScript example app connected to a simulated reader\n\nThe simulated reader handles events just like a physical reader, so you can\ncontinue to collecting your first payment.\n\nThe simulated reader functionality is built into the SDK, so you can use it to\ndevelop and test your own point of sale application without connecting to a\nphysical device.\n\n[Collect your first\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/example-applications#collect-payment)\nCollect your first payment using the example application and a simulated reader.\nEach of the examples features an event log for you to reference as you integrate\nTerminal in your own application. As you collect your first payment, youâ€™ll see\nthe following sequence:\n\n- **Create payment**: The example application collects a payment method using\nthe SDK.\n- **Collect payment method**: The simulated reader receives a card.\n- **Process and capture**: The example application and backend finalize the\npayment.\n\n#### Note\n\n(Optional) Use [separate authorization and\ncapture](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/place-a-hold-on-a-payment-method) to\nadd a reconciliation step before finalizing the transaction. You can also\n[automatically\ncapture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-capture_method)\nTerminal transactions.\n\nJavaScriptiOSAndroidReact Native\n\n![Javascript example app connected to simulated\nreader](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/js-example-app-payment.8069a69561566519d001038a46bfe6b5.png)\n\nCollecting a payment, using the JavaScript example app and a simulated reader\n\n## Next steps\n\n- [Design an\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/designing-integration)\n\n## Links\n\n- [sample integration](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/quickstart)\n- [example backend](https://github.com/stripe/example-terminal-backend)\n- [GitHub](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-terminal-js-demo)\n-\n[https://github.com/stripe/stripe-terminal-js-demo.git](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-terminal-js-demo.git)\n- [simulated\nreader](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/references/testing#simulated-reader)\n- [separate authorization and\ncapture](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/place-a-hold-on-a-payment-method)\n- [automatically\ncapture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-capture_method)\n- [Design an\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/designing-integration)",
