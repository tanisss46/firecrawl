## Learn how to set up your Capital program in the Dashboard.

Learn how to set up an embedded financing program in the
[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/capital) (no-code) to offer
your connected accounts access to financing.

To set up your Capital program, you must complete the following onboarding steps
in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/capital):

- [View an interactive
demo](https://docs.stripe.com/capital/no-code-integration#interactive-demo).
Explore and interact with the end-to-end Capital flow for your connected
accounts and learn how to manage your Capital program.
- [Provide emails for your connected
accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/capital/no-code-integration#provide-emails).
Check and update the email addresses for your connected accounts to make sure
they receive their Capital offers.
- [Sign partnership
contract](https://docs.stripe.com/capital/no-code-integration#partnership-contract).
Review and sign our Capital partnership contract.
- [Send your first
offers](https://docs.stripe.com/capital/no-code-integration#send-offers). You
can send production Capital offers to your eligible connected accounts before
activating automatic offers.
- [Activate automatic
offers](https://docs.stripe.com/capital/no-code-integration#activate-automatic-offers).
Review the available offers for your connected accounts, and activate automatic
offers so all eligible connected accounts receive Capital offers every month.

#### Note

You can develop marketing assets to announce and promote the Capital program to
your customers. While this isnâ€™t a requirement for your integration, marketing
might help with user awareness and adoption. For guidelines and pre-approved
templates for announcement emails, landing pages, and social posts, see [how to
market Capital](https://docs.stripe.com/capital/marketing).

[View an interactive
demo](https://docs.stripe.com/capital/no-code-integration#interactive-demo)
The [Capital demo](https://dashboard.stripe.com/capital/demo) provides helpful
information about the Capital program and what your customer sees. The
walkthrough shows how you can manage the branding that customers see in their
capital offer emails, application, and active financing page. You can adjust the
public business name, icon, and branding color, and set up custom domains that
update the sender email address domain.

[Provide emails for your connected
accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/capital/no-code-integration#provide-emails)
To receive Capital offers, connected accounts must have an email saved with
Stripe. You can confirm email addresses and upload missing email addresses for
all eligible accounts through the [Stripe Comms
Center](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/comms_center/collect?integration=capital_for_platforms).
Make sure you have the necessary consent to share email addresses with Stripe
for these purposes.

[Sign partnership
contract](https://docs.stripe.com/capital/no-code-integration#partnership-contract)
Before launching your Stripe Capital program, you must sign the partnership
contract in the Dashboard and review the [regulatory compliance
guidelines](https://docs.stripe.com/capital/regulatory-compliance).

[Send your first
offers](https://docs.stripe.com/capital/no-code-integration#send-offers)
Send capital offers to your eligible connected accounts to finalize your
integration. Confirmed offers are delivered to the email addresses for the
connected accounts. The offers also appear in the Financing Offer table, where
you can see offer terms and any available email engagement data.

#### Note

Connected account selection is randomized to comply with the [Equal Credit
Opportunity Act
(ECOA)](https://www.fdic.gov/resources/supervision-and-examinations/consumer-compliance-examination-manual/documents/5/v-7-1.pdf),
which protects borrowers by prohibiting unfair and discriminatory practices.

[Activate automatic
offers](https://docs.stripe.com/capital/no-code-integration#activate-automatic-offers)
If you activate automatic offers, all eligible connected accounts with an email
address receive an offer email the following business day. Connected accounts
receive additional offer emails every 30 days, as long as they remain eligible.
You can turn off automatic offers and pause emails at any time from the
[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/capital).
