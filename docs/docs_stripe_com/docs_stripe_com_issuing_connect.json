  "content": "# Set up an Issuing and Connect integration\n\n## Learn how to issue cards on connected accounts.\n\n[Stripe Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect) provides Stripe Issuing\nplatforms with foundational infrastructure to manage funds flows and compliance\nrequirements. In a Connect integration, the platform account makes API calls on\nbehalf of the connected accounts.\n\n## When to use Connect\n\nIf you need to issue cards for users that aren’t directly employed by your\nbusiness, set up Stripe Connect for your Issuing integration. For example, a\nbusiness building a new expense management product for small businesses can\nintegrate with Connect. Each small business that uses the expense management\nproduct is set up as a connected account.\n\nAfter you set up and onboard connected accounts, your customers can support\ntheir card spend by funding their Issuing balance from their external bank\naccount (or, in certain cases, your customers’ spend can be supported by your\nplatform Issuing balance). Your customers can also create cardholders and cards\nand set up spending controls.\n\n[Create connected accounts with Issuing\ncapabilities](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/connect#create-connected-accounts-with-issuing-capabilities)\nTo issue cards, each business entity must use a connected account. Issuing only\nsupports connected accounts that don’t use a Stripe-hosted Dashboard, and where\nyour platform is responsible for requirements collection and loss liability,\nalso known as a Custom connected account. Learn how to [create connected\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/design-an-integration?connect-onboarding-surface=api&connect-dashboard-type=none&connect-economic-model=buy-rate&connect-loss-liability-owner=platform&connect-charge-type=direct)\nthat work with Issuing. All accounts must request the `card_issuing` and\n`transfers` [account\ncapabilities](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities).\n\n#### Private preview\n\nEnabling Issuing on non-custom connected accounts is a new feature. Email\n[issuing-beta-feedback@stripe.com](mailto:issuing-beta-feedback@stripe.com) to\nrequest access.\n\n#### Create an account\n\nCreate a new connected account [through the\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard/managing-individual-accounts#creating-accounts)\nor using the API with [create\nAccount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/create).\n\n#### Start with test mode accounts\n\nTest mode connected accounts can’t receive or spend real money and can’t be used\nin live mode, but they’re identical in configuration and functionality.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d country=US \\\n -d \"capabilities[transfers][requested]\"=true \\\n -d \"capabilities[card_issuing][requested]\"=true \\\n -d \"controller[stripe_dashboard][type]\"=none \\\n -d \"controller[fees][payer]\"=application \\\n -d \"controller[losses][payments]\"=application \\\n -d \"controller[requirement_collection]\"=application\n```\n\n#### Enable Issuing on existing connected accounts\n\nIf your platform already has a Connect integration with connected accounts, you\ncan request Issuing on those accounts [through the\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard/managing-individual-accounts#updating-capabilities)\nor through the API.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts/{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}} \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d \"capabilities[card_issuing][requested]\"=true\n```\n\n#### Issuing and Treasury accounts\n\nIf your platform already has [connected\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/accounts), make sure they have a\nsupported configuration for Issuing or Treasury. Issuing only supports connected\naccounts that don’t use a Stripe-hosted Dashboard, and where your platform is\nresponsible for requirements collection and loss liability, also known as a\nCustom connected account. If this isn’t the case, you must create new accounts\nto use Issuing or Treasury. You can see your existing account’s configuration on\nthe [Connect accounts](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/accounts/overview)\npage in your Dashboard.\n\nYou can also use the API to retrieve the account information and verify that the\n`capabilities` property has the Issuing capability requested. The capability\nwon’t be active until all the requirements are fulfilled.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\"\n```\n\n```\n{\n \"object\": \"list\",\n \"data\": [\n {\n \"id\": \"acct_1234\",\n \"object\": \"account\",\n ...\n \"capabilities\": {\n \"card_issuing\": \"inactive\",\n \"transfers\": \"active\",\n },\n ...\n \"controller\": {\n \"stripe_dashboard\": {\n \"type\": \"none\"\n },\n \"fees\": {\n \"payer\": \"application\"\n },\n \"losses\": {\n \"payments\": \"application\"\n },\n \"is_controller\": true,\n \"type\": \"application\",\n \"requirement_collection\": \"application\"\n },\n },\n ...\n ]\n}\n```\n\n[Start the identity verification\nprocess](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/connect#onboard-connected-accounts)\nAfter you create a connected account, you need to provide more information about\nthe account holder. The [capability\nobject](https://docs.stripe.com/api/capabilities/object) has a `requirements`\nhash that contains `currently_due` [identity verification\nrequirements](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/handling-api-verification). The\nuser must provide the details itemized in the `requirements` hash to enable\nIssuing capabilities.\n\nIf you create an Account object in test mode and want to bypass onboarding\nrequirements to test functionality, use the [Accounts update\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/update) to provide [test\nvalues](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/testing-verification) that fulfill all\nthe requirements.\n\nDepending on the [business\ntype](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/identity-verification#business-type), the\nuser provides details about the individual, company, non-profit organization, or\ngovernment entity (Stripe Treasury doesn’t support government entities).\n\nChoose one of the following onboarding options:\n\nStripe-hosted onboardingEmbedded onboardingAPI onboarding\n[Stripe-hosted onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/hosted-onboarding) is\na web form hosted by Stripe with your brand’s name, color, and icon.\nStripe-hosted onboarding uses the [Accounts\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts) to read the requirements and generate\nan onboarding form with robust data validation and is localized for all\nStripe-supported countries.\n\nBefore using Connect Onboarding, you must provide the name, color, and icon of\nyour brand in the Branding section of your [Connect settings\npage](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/connect).\n\nYou can use hosted onboarding to allow connected accounts to link an\n`external_account` (which is required for payouts) by enabling it through your\n[Connect Onboarding settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect).\n\nTo create an onboarding link for the connected account, use the [Account Links\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links/create).\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/account_links \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d account={{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}} \\\n --data-urlencode refresh_url=\"https://example.com/reauth\" \\\n --data-urlencode return_url=\"https://example.com/return\" \\\n -d type=account_onboarding\n```\n\n#### Caution\n\nFor security reasons, don’t email, text, or send account link URLs directly to\nyour connected account. We recommend that you distribute the account link URL\nfrom within your platform’s application, where their account is authenticated.\n\nThe response you receive includes the `url` parameter containing the link for\nyour connected account to onboard to your platform.\n\n```\n{\n \"object\": \"account_link\",\n \"created\": 1612927106,\n \"expires_at\": 1612927406,\n \"url\": \"https://connect.stripe.com/setup/s/…\"\n}\n```\n\n## Collect and verify required information\n\nWhen you create a connected account and request capabilities, the response\nreturns a list of all required information. To see the requirements specific to\na capability, [retrieve the account\ncapability](https://docs.stripe.com/api/capabilities/retrieve) and look at\n`requirements.past_due`.\n\n#### Note\n\nIf you don’t intend to allow your connected accounts to [pay out an Issuing\nbalance to an external\naccount](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/connect/funding#pay-out-an-issuing-balance),\nthen you can ignore requirements past_due for `external_account`.\n\nHere are the requirements to activate the `card_issuing` capability:\n\nFIELDPARAMETERADDITIONAL NOTESLegal name`company.name` Business\naddress`company.address.*`The address can’t be a P.O. box, a Highway Contract\n(HC) box, or a private mailbox.

Each connected account must have at least\none representative, who’s usually an executive or director, depending on where\nthe account is located. They must be able to certify that the information\nprovided is correct. Beneficial owners aren’t required.\n\nLearn more about [beneficial owners, representatives, and\ndirectors](https://support.stripe.com/questions/beneficial-owner-and-director-definitions).\n\nFIELDPARAMETERADDITIONAL NOTESLegal name`first_name`, `last_name` Date of\nbirth`dob.day`, `dob.month`, `dob.year` Residential address`address.*`The\naddress can’t be a P.O. box, a Highway Contract (HC) box, or a private mailbox.\nIt must be in the US for US-based accounts.Email`email` Title`title`Examples for\nthe title include CEO or Director.Phone`phone` US Tax ID or last 4 digits of\nSSN`id_number`Accounts of US-based platforms must provide a social security\nnumber, and non-US tax ID numbers or ID documents aren’t accepted as a\nsubstitute. You can provide either the full nine-digit social security number\n(`id_number`) or the last four digits (`ssn_last_4`) initially. If verification\nwith the last four digits is unsuccessful, then the full nine-digit number is\nrequired.ID document scan`verification.document`Provide an identity document if\nthe full nine-digit social security number can’t be verified. See the\n[acceptable verification documents by\ncountry](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/handling-api-verification#acceptable-verification-documents).[Handle\nnew requirements coming due and changes to the capability\nstatus](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/connect#handle-new-requirements-changes)\nSometimes after providing all required information, an account might need to\nprovide additional details or documents. These new requirements appear in the\n[requirements.eventually_due](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-requirements-eventually_due)\narray or in\n[requirements.currently_due](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-requirements-currently_due).\nSet up your integration to listen for changes to account requirements by [using\nwebhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/handling-api-verification#verification-process).\n\nIf the capability is already `active` and the account doesn’t satisfy new\nrequirements due on that capability before the [current\ndeadline](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-requirements-current_deadline),\nthe capability becomes `inactive` until the requirements are satisfied.\n\n### Document uploads\n\nIf an account’s information can’t be verified, Stripe might require a document\nto verify the identity of a person (for example, a Passport) or to verify\ninformation about the legal entity (for example, a letter from the tax\nauthority). To satisfy document requirements, platforms can send the user to\nConnect Onboarding (where they’ll be [prompted to upload the\ndocument](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding#new-reqs-due)),\nor collect the document from the account in another interface and [upload it\nthrough the\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/handling-api-verification#upload-a-file).\n\n### Failure to verify identity within 29 days of the initial application\n\nAfter an account submits all the [required\ninformation](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/connect#required-verification-information)\nfor Issuing and accepts the Issuing terms of service, Stripe considers the\napplication complete. If we can’t verify an account’s information, the\ncapability remains `inactive` until the account provides additional information\nor uploads a document.\n\nIf the account remains `inactive` 29 days after completing the application, you\nmust send an email notice to the account informing them that we couldn’t verify\ntheir identity ([see the\ntemplate](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/compliance-us/issuing-regulated-customer-notices?issuing-notices-sender=stripe#spend-card-application-rejected-for-failure-to-verify-identity)).\n\nStripe monitors for completed applications with unverified identities, and takes\nthe following action after 29 days in live mode and after 1 hour in [test\nmode](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/testing):\n\n- [Generates an account\nnotice](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/compliance-us/issuing-regulated-customer-notices?issuing-notices-sender=stripe#events-that-require-a-customer-notice)\n- Clears the [Issuing terms of service acceptance\nhash](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-settings-card_issuing-tos_acceptance)\nso terms acceptance becomes a `currently_due` requirement\n\nYou can submit a new application at any time by updating the business\ninformation and recording a new acceptance of Issuing’s terms.\n\nStripe recommends that you present the terms of service as the last step of\nonboarding, which allows you to track the timing of application completion by\nreferring to the term’s [acceptance\ndate](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-settings-card_issuing-tos_acceptance-date).\n\n### Terms of service violations\n\nIf Stripe identifies a connect account that has violated Stripe’s terms of\nservice, Stripe sets the Issuing capability on the account to `inactive`,\ndeactivates any cards, and notifies the account (see [the email\ntemplate](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/compliance-us/issuing-regulated-customer-notices?issuing-notices-sender=stripe#account-closed-by-stripe-for-terms-of-service-violation)).\nThis might happen when an account’s cards are used in relation to [prohibited or\nrestricted businesses](https://stripe.com/legal/restricted-businesses), such as\nillegal activities, gambling, firearms, adult content, or cryptocurrencies, or\nin relation to [prohibited activities for\nIssuing](https://stripe.com/legal/restricted-businesses#additional-product-specific-prohibitions),\nsuch as consumer spending, primarily international use, lending, or other\nabusive or noncompliant use.\n\n### Accounts inactive for more than 395 days\n\nStripe disables issuing on accounts that haven’t completed any card transactions\nin the past 13 months (395 days). For accounts with additional capabilities,\nStripe only disables Issuing if there have also been no payments or Treasury\ntransactions in the prior 395 days, and the Treasury balance is 9.99 USD or\nless. When Issuing is disabled for inactivity, the Connect account’s\ncard_issuing capability status changes to `inactive` and the capability\nrequirements show a\n[disabled_reason](https://docs.stripe.com/api/capabilities/object#capability_object-requirements-disabled_reason)\nof `rejected.inactivity`. Learn more about [managing inactive\naccounts](https://support.stripe.com/questions/issuing-managing-inactive-connect-accounts)\nwith Issuing.\n\n[Create cardholders and\ncards](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/connect#create-cardholders-and-cards)\nA Cardholder object represents an individual or business entity that you can\nissue cards to. Each cardholder needs to be associated with a connected account\nto be issued a virtual or physical card. One connected account can have many\ncardholders.\n\nLearn more about [Cardholders and\ncards](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/connect/cardholders-and-cards).\n\n[Add funds](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/connect#Add-funds)\nThe Issuing balance is separate from the connected account’s main balance. When\nissued cards are used for transactions, they draw from the Issuing balance.\n\nBefore an issued card can be used for transactions, you must first allocate\nfunds to the connected account’s [Issuing\nbalance](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/funding/balance) associated with the\ncard. An Issuing Balance holds funds reserved for the card and is safely\nseparated from earnings, [payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts), and funds\nfrom other Stripe products.

An account might appear as `restricted` in the Dashboard if\nrequirements are `past_due` for any of the requested capabilities (including\n`transfers`). You can ignore this if `card_issuing` is active.\n\nYou can also do the following from the dashboard:\n\n- View account activity for a selected account.\n- Edit business and personal details for a selected account.\n- Create cardholders, cards, or test authorizations on the account. To do so,\nclick the overflow menu (), select **View Dashboard as (account name)**, and\nthen navigate to **Card issuing**.\n- View program details for a selected account. Follow the above steps to **View\nDashboard as (account name)**, then navigate to **Settings**, the **Issuing**\nsection, and click [Card\nprograms](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/issuing/card-programs).\n\nYou can also access the Issuing page for a connected account directly by\nnavigating to this URL and replacing `{{CONNECT_ACCOUNT_ID}}` with the\nappropriate value:\n`https://dashboard.stripe.com/{{CONNECT_ACCOUNT_ID}}/issuing/overview`\n\nAs the platform, only you can view the Dashboard on behalf of your connected\naccounts.
