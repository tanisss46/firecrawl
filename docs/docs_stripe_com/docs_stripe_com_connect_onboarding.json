Stripe recommends\nusing Stripe-hosted onboarding or Embedded onboarding. These options\nautomatically update to handle changing requirements when they apply to a\nconnected account.\n\n[STRIPE-HOSTED\nONBOARDING](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/hosted-onboarding)[EMBEDDED\nONBOARDING](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/embedded-onboarding)[API\nONBOARDING](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/api-onboarding)INTEGRATION\nEFFORTMinimal, go live quicklyMore effort, go live quicklyMost effort, can delay\ngoing liveCUSTOMIZATIONStripe-branded with limited platform branding[Highly\nthemeable](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/customize-connect-embedded-components)\nwith limited Stripe brandingFull control over your own UIAUTOMATIC UPDATES FOR\nNEW COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTSImmediateImmediateRequires integration changesSUPPORT\nNEW COUNTRIES WITHOUT INTEGRATION CHANGESSUPPORT LEGAL ENTITY SHARINGFLOW\nLOGICLimited controlLimited controlFull controlIDEAL FORPlatforms that want\nStripe to handle onboardingPlatforms that want a branded onboarding flow within\ntheir applicationPlatforms that require full control of the onboarding flow and\nhave the resources to build and maintain it\n## Stripe-hosted onboarding\n\nStripe-hosted onboarding is a web form hosted by Stripe with your brand’s name,\ncolor, and icon. Stripe-hosted onboarding uses the [Accounts\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts) to read the requirements and generate\nan onboarding form with robust data validation and is localized for all\nStripe-supported countries.\n\nStripe-hosted onboarding supports [Legal Entity\nSharing](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/legal-entity-sharing), which allows\nowners of multiple Stripe accounts to share certain business information between\nthem. When they onboard an account, they can reuse that information from an\nexisting account instead of resubmitting it.\n\nUse Stripe-hosted onboarding if you want Stripe to handle onboarding with little\neffort from your platform.\n\n[Learn more about Stripe-hosted\nonboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/hosted-onboarding)\n\n## Embedded onboarding\n\nEmbedded onboarding is a highly themeable onboarding UI with limited Stripe\nbranding. Your platform embeds the [Account onboarding\ncomponent](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/supported-embedded-components/account-onboarding)\nin your application, and your connected accounts interact with the embedded\ncomponent without ever leaving your application. Embedded onboarding uses the\n[Accounts API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts) to read the requirements\nand generate an onboarding form with robust data validation and is localized for\nall Stripe-supported countries.\n\nEmbedded onboarding supports [Legal Entity\nSharing](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/legal-entity-sharing), which allows\nowners of multiple Stripe accounts to share certain business information between\nthem. When they onboard an account, they can reuse that information from an\nexisting account instead of resubmitting it.\n\nWith embedded onboarding, you get a customized onboarding flow without the\ncomplexity and maintenance associated with updating your onboarding integration\nas compliance requirements change.\n\n[Learn more about Embedded\nonboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/embedded-onboarding)\n\n## API onboarding\n\nYou use the [Accounts API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts) to build an\nonboarding flow and handle identity verification, localization, and error\nhandling for each country your connected accounts onboard in. Stripe can be\ncompletely invisible to the account holder. Your platform is responsible for all\ninteractions with your connected accounts and for collecting all the information\nneeded to verify each account. Verification requirements are updated as laws and\nregulations change around the world. You must plan on reviewing and updating\nonboarding requirements at least every six months.\n\nStripe doesn’t recommend this option unless you’re fully committed to the\noperational complexity required to build and maintain an API onboarding flow.\nFor a customized onboarding flow, Stripe strongly recommends embedded\nonboarding.\n\n[Learn more about API\nonboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/api-onboarding)\n\n## Links\n\n- [STRIPE-HOSTED ONBOARDING](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/hosted-onboarding)\n- [EMBEDDED ONBOARDING](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/embedded-onboarding)\n- [API ONBOARDING](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/api-onboarding)\n- [Highly\nthemeable](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/customize-connect-embedded-components)\n- [Accounts API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts)\n- [Legal Entity Sharing](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/legal-entity-sharing)\n- [Account onboarding\ncomponent](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/supported-embedded-components/account-onboarding)",
