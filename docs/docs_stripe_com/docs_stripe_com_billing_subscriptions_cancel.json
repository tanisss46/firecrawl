You\ncan configure the number of attempts in your [subscription lifecycle\nsettings](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview#settings).\nLearn more about revenue recovery settings, such as [Smart\nRetries](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/revenue-recovery/smart-retries#smart-retries)\nand configurable [customer\nemails](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/revenue-recovery/customer-emails#configure-emails).\n\n## Cancel subscriptions\n\nYou can cancel customer subscriptions manually with the\n[API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/cancel) or in the\n[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/subscriptions). By default,\ncancellation takes effect immediately and\n[invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices) are no longer generated for\ncanceled subscriptions. After it’s canceled, you can no longer update the\nsubscription or its [metadata](https://docs.stripe.com/metadata).\n\n#### Common mistake\n\nIf you set a custom cancellation date, you can’t provide a refund. A credit\nproration is always generated. To prevent a credit proration from generating,\nmake sure the custom cancellation date is within the current billing period and\n`proration_behavior` is set to `none`.\n\nDashboardAPI\nTo cancel a subscription in the Dashboard:\n\n- From the [Subscriptions](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/subscriptions)\npage, click the overflow menu (), then select **Cancel subscription**.\n- Choose when to end the subscription: immediately, at the end of the period, or\non a custom day.\n- Choose to provide a refund for a\n[prorated](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/prorations) amount,\nrefund the last payment in full, or provide no\n[refund](https://docs.stripe.com/refunds).\n- After finalizing all settings, click **Cancel subscription**.\n\n### Prorate for usage-based billing\n\nIf a subscription is part of the way through a paid billing period, you can\nprorate the cancellation by passing the\n[prorate](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/cancel#cancel_subscription-prorate)\nparameter.\n\nWhen you prorate a cancellation, you can optionally invoice for:\n\n- Outstanding prorations\n- [Metered\nusage](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models#usage-based-pricing)\n\nIf you don’t prorate the subscription, all metered usage gets discarded and the\ncustomer won’t receive credit for any potential prorations.\n\nCreate a final invoice immediately using the\n[invoice_now](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/cancel#cancel_subscription-invoice_now)\nparameter. If you owe the customer a credit after cancellation, you can add the\ncredit to their credit balance to apply to future invoices. To [refund your\ncustomer](https://support.stripe.com/questions/refunding-credit-balance-to-customer-after-subscription-downgrade-or-cancellation),\nissue [refunds](https://docs.stripe.com/refunds#issuing) and then [adjust their\naccount balance](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance#modifying)\nback to zero.\n\n### Cancel at the end of the current billing cycle\n\nTo cancel a subscription at the end of the current billing period, set\n`cancel_at_period_end` to `true`:\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscriptions/{{SUBSCRIPTION_ID}} \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d cancel_at_period_end=true\n```\n\nThis allows the subscription to complete the duration of time the customer has\nalready paid for. You can reactivate subscriptions scheduled for cancellation by\nupdating `cancel_at_period_end` to `false`. You can reactivate the subscription\nat any time up to the end of the period.\n\n### Cancel after scheduled changes or future billing cycles\n\nTo schedule a subscription to end after a specified number of billing cycles,\n[create a subscription\nschedule](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/subscription-schedules).\nSet the schedule length by specifying one or more phases and intervals, and set\nits\n[end_behavior](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscription_schedules/create#create_subscription_schedule-end_behavior)\nattribute to `cancel`.\n\nWith an end behavior of `cancel`, subscription schedules automatically manage\nthe subscription’s\n[cancel_at](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/cancel#custom-cancel-date)\nattribute. When the schedule is in its last phase, the subscription’s cancel\ndate is set to the phase’s end date, otherwise, the cancel date isn’t set on the\nsubscription.\n\nAs a result, adding a new phase to a schedule that’s currently in its last phase\nremoves the cancel date. If the subscription is in its last billing period when\nextending or removing the cancel date, this might update the period end and\nbilling cycle anchor. See how to [set a custom cancel\ndate](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/cancel#custom-cancel-date)\nfor more details.\n\n### Configure automatic cancellation after a dispute\n\n#### Limited support\n\nThis feature is only supported for disputed credit and debit card payments\nopened in the *full amount*.\n\nWhen a customer [disputes](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes) a charge for a\nsubscription, the subscription continues to cycle, which can create more\ndisputed charges. You can change this behavior in the\n[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/automatic) to cancel\nsubscriptions instead. Changes to the subscription take effect after\napproximately one hour.\n\nUnder [Manage disputed\npayments](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/automatic), select one\nof the following:\n\n- **cancel the subscription immediately without prorating** – The subscription\ncancels immediately without any prorating. You can’t restart a canceled\nsubscription. You must create a new subscription for the customer if you want to\ncontinue billing them.\n- **cancel the subscription at the end of the period** – The subscription\ncancels at the end of the current billing period and\n[cancel_at_period_end](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-cancel_at_period_end)\nis set to `true`. This allows you time to work through the dispute process\nbefore the cancellation occurs.\n\nFor subscriptions managed with\n[schedules](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/subscription-schedules),\nthe subscription is first released from the schedule and then canceled. This\nmeans the rest of the scheduled changes won’t take effect.\n\n## Handle invoice items when canceling subscriptions\n\nYour customer might still be billed for pending [invoice\nitems](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/subscription#adding-draft-invoice-items)\non a subscription in the following cases:\n\n- The subscription cancellation includes a final invoice\n- Your customer has another active subscription\n\nTo prevent billing your customer for pending invoice items, you must [manually\ndelete](https://docs.stripe.com/api#delete_invoiceitem) the invoice items.\n\nSimilarly, any\n[usage](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based/recording-usage)\nreported during the billing period bills at the end of the period. To avoid a\nfinal usage charge, use the\n[clear_usage](https://docs.stripe.com/api#update_subscription-items-clear_usage)\nparameter to [update the\nsubscription](https://docs.stripe.com/api#update_subscription) and remove the\nmetered price.\n\nIf you set the subscription to cancel at period end, any pending prorations are\nleft in place and still collected at the end of the period. If you cancel the\nsubscription before the end of the period, invoice items remain and won’t be\nprocessed unless you specifically generate an invoice that includes them.\n\nWhen you cancel a subscription, all `open` and `draft` invoices for that\nsubscription have their `auto_advance` property set to `false`. This [pauses\nautomatic\ncollection](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection)\nfor these invoices and prevents automatic reminder emails from sending. You can\nstill manually attempt to collect payment and send emails.\n\n## Identify cancellation events\n\nStripe sends the following events for canceled subscriptions.\n\nEventDescription`customer.subscription.deleted`Sent when you cancel a customer’s\nsubscription immediately. If the event’s `request` property isn’t `null`, that\nindicates the cancellation is a result of your request rather than based on your\nsubscription settings.`customer.subscription.updated`Sent when you cancel a\ncustomer’s subscription at the end of the billing period. This triggers when you\nset `cancel_at_period_end` to `true` and the event reflects a change in the\n`cancel_at_period_end` value for the subscription.\n## Stop a pending cancellation\n\nYou can stop a scheduled cancellation through the [Update Subscription\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/update) or the\n[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/subscriptions). You can’t\nreactivate a canceled subscription.\n\nDashboardAPI\nTo stop a scheduled cancellation in the Dashboard:\n\n- On the [Subscriptions page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/subscriptions),\nselect the subscription you want to update.\n- From the Subscription details page, click **Actions**, then select **Don’t\ncancel**.\n\n## Set a custom cancel date\n\nUse the\n[cancel_at](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/update#update_subscription-cancel_at)\nparameter to cancel a subscription at a future timestamp.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscriptions/{{SUBSCRIPTION_ID}} \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d cancel_at=1723766400\n```\n\nWhen you schedule a cancel date that occurs before the billing period ends, the\nsubscription’s\n[current_period_end](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-current_period_end)\nupdates to match the `cancel_at` date. This creates prorations for the change in\nthe current period, unless your update\n[disables](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/prorations#disable-prorations)\nprorations.\n\nIf you schedule a cancel date that occurs more than one period away, the\nsubscription’s cycle remains unaffected until the subscription renews into the\nperiod that contains the `cancel_at` date. Then, the `current_period_end` for\nthe renewal shortens to match the `cancel_at` date.\n\nFor example, your customer subscribes to a 120 USD per year licensed\nsubscription that renews on January 1, 2024. They set the subscription to cancel\non July 1, 2024. The final invoice subtotal on January 1 calculates as 60 USD\nand the `current_period_end` is July 1.\n\nChanging, adding, or removing a scheduled cancel date within the current period\nupdates the `current_period_end` and creates prorations. In the above example,\non February 15 you update the cancel date to October 1. The current period end\nbecomes October 1, and Stripe creates prorations for 30 USD for the additional\nquarter. To invoice the prorated items immediately instead of in a final invoice\non October 1, pass a\n[proration_behavior](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/update#update_subscription-proration_behavior)\nof `always_invoice` in the update, or separately [create a one-off\ninvoice](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/subscription#generating-invoices).\n\nThe subscription’s [billing cycle\nanchor](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-billing_cycle_anchor)\nproperty might change if it tracked the previous cancel date. During the first\nperiod, Stripe preserves any anchor you [originally\nset](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/billing-cycle#new-subscriptions)\non the subscription. When the first period has finished, or if you didn’t\nprovide a custom anchor when creating the subscription, the anchor resets to the\n[current period\nstart](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-current_period_start).\n\nAdding a cancel date or moving an existing one closer to the current time\nshortens the [billing cycle\nanchor](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-billing_cycle_anchor)\nto match the new cancel date. In the above example, on February 15 you update\nthe cancel date to April 1. The period end and billing anchor become April 1,\nand Stripe creates prorations for -30 USD to credit your customer for unused\ntime for April 1 to July 1.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Using trial periods](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/trials)\n- [Update subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/api#update_subscription)\n- [Cancel subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/api#cancel_subscription)\n\n## Links\n\n- [customer portal cancellation\npage](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management/cancellation-page)\n- [Subscription API](https://docs.stripe.com/api#cancel_subscription)\n- [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/subscriptions)\n- [pause payment\ncollection](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/pause-payment)\n- [subscription\nstatus](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview#subscription-statuses)\n- [Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating)\n- [subscription lifecycle\nsettings](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview#settings)\n- [Smart\nRetries](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/revenue-recovery/smart-retries#smart-retries)\n- [customer\nemails](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/revenue-recovery/customer-emails#configure-emails)\n- [API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/cancel)\n- [invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n- [metadata](https://docs.stripe.com/metadata)\n- [prorated](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/prorations)\n- [refund](https://docs.stripe.com/refunds)\n-\n[prorate](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/cancel#cancel_subscription-prorate)\n- [Metered\nusage](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models#usage-based-pricing)\n-\n[invoice_now](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/cancel#cancel_subscription-invoice_now)\n- [refund your\ncustomer](https://support.stripe.com/questions/refunding-credit-balance-to-customer-after-subscription-downgrade-or-cancellation)\n- [refunds](https://docs.stripe.com/refunds#issuing)\n- [adjust their account\nbalance](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance#modifying)\n- [create a subscription\nschedule](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/subscription-schedules)\n-\n[end_behavior](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscription_schedules/create#create_subscription_schedule-end_behavior)\n-\n[cancel_at](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/cancel#custom-cancel-date)\n- [disputes](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes)\n- [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/automatic)\n-\n[cancel_at_period_end](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-cancel_at_period_end)\n- [invoice\nitems](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/subscription#adding-draft-invoice-items)\n- [manually delete](https://docs.stripe.com/api#delete_invoiceitem)\n-\n[usage](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based/recording-usage)\n-\n[clear_usage](https://docs.stripe.com/api#update_subscription-items-clear_usage)\n- [update the subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/api#update_subscription)\n- [pauses automatic\ncollection](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection)\n- [Update Subscription API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/update)\n-\n[cancel_at](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/update#update_subscription-cancel_at)\n-\n[current_period_end](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-current_period_end)\n-\n[disables](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/prorations#disable-prorations)\n-\n[proration_behavior](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/update#update_subscription-proration_behavior)\n- [create a one-off\ninvoice](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/subscription#generating-invoices)\n- [billing cycle\nanchor](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-billing_cycle_anchor)\n- [originally\nset](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/billing-cycle#new-subscriptions)\n- [current period\nstart](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-current_period_start)\n- [Using trial periods](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/trials)",
