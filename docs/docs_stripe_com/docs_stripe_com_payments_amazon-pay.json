After completing the payment, Amazon\nredirects them back to your website.\n\nPayment method propertiesBusiness locationsProduct support- **Customer\nlocations**\n\nWorldwide\n- **Presentment currency**\n\nUSD\n- **Presentment currency Private preview**\n\nAUD, GBP, DKK, EUR, HKD, JPY, NZD, NOK, ZAR, SEK, CHF\n- **Payment confirmation**\n\nCustomer-initiated\n- **Payment method family**\n\nWallet\n- **Recurring payments**\n\nYes\n- **Payout timing**\n\nStandard payout timing applies\n- **Connect support**\n\nYes\n- **Dispute support**\n\n[Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/amazon-pay#disputed-payments)\n- **Manual capture support**\n\nYes\n- **Refunds / Partial refunds**\n\n[Yes / Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/amazon-pay#refunds)\n\n## Payment flow\n\nBelow is a demonstration of the Amazon Pay payment flow from your checkout page:\n\n## Get started\n\nYou don’t have to integrate Amazon Pay and other payment methods individually.\nIf you use our front-end products, Stripe automatically determines the most\nrelevant payment methods to display. Go to the [Stripe\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and enable\nAmazon Pay. To get started with one of our hosted UIs, follow a quickstart:\n\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart): Our prebuilt, hosted\ncheckout page.\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart): Our drop-in UI\ncomponents.\n\n### Other payment products\n\nThe following Stripe products also let you add Amazon Pay from the Dashboard:\n\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n\nIf your integration requires manually listing payment methods, learn how to\n[manually configure Amazon Pay as a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/amazon-pay/accept-a-payment).\n\n## Refunds\n\nAmazon Pay supports partial or full refunds for up to 90 days after the original\npurchase, and processes them asynchronously. After Stripe initiates a refund,\nAmazon Pay issues the refund to the customer’s original form of payment. We\nnotify you of the final refund status using the `refund.updated` or\n`refund.failed` [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) event. When a refund\nsucceeds, the [Refund](https://docs.stripe.com/api/refunds/object) object’s\nstatus transitions to `succeeded`. If a refund fails, the Refund object’s status\ntransitions to `failed` and we return the amount to your Stripe balance. You\nthen need to arrange an alternative way to provide your customer with a refund.\n\nFor some Amazon Pay transactions that use non-card payment methods, refunds can\ntake up to 14 calendar days from the purchase date to return a status.\n\n## Disputes\n\nCustomers must authenticate Amazon Pay payments by logging into their Amazon\naccount. This requirement helps reduce the risk of fraud or unrecognized\npayments.\n\nCustomers have up to 240 calendar days from the date of purchase to file a\ndispute. The dispute process works like this:\n\n- After the customer initiates a dispute, Stripe notifies you through email, the\nStripe Dashboard, and an API `charge.dispute.created` event (if your integration\nis set up to receive [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks)).\n- Stripe holds back the disputed amount from your balance until Amazon resolves\nthe dispute.\n- Stripe requests that you upload compelling evidence that you fulfilled the\npurchase order [using the Stripe\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/responding#respond). This evidence\ncan include:\n\n- A received return confirmation (for shipped goods returned from the customer\nto you)\n- The tracking ID\n- The shipping date\n- A record of purchase for intangible goods, such as IP address or email receipt\n- A record of purchase for services or physical goods, such as phone number or\nproof of receipt\n- This information helps Amazon determine if a dispute is valid or if it should\nbe rejected. Make sure the evidence you provide contains as much detail as\npossible from what the customer provided at checkout. You must submit the\nrequested information within 10 calendar days. Amazon Pay makes a decision\nwithin 90 calendar days of evidence submission. If Amazon resolves the dispute\nwith you winning, Stripe returns the disputed amount to your Stripe balance. If\nAmazon rules in favor of the customer, the balance charge becomes permanent.\n\nAmazon Pay offers an [A-to-z\nGuarantee](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GQ37ZCNECJKTFYQV)\nthat protects buyers from issues related to timely delivery and the condition of\ntheir items. A buyer can make a claim against this guarantee, which follows the\nsame dispute process described above. A-to-z Guarantee claims don’t incur\ndispute fees. In the Dashboard and in the dispute object, you can distinguish\nA-to-z Guarantee claims as `dispute_type = claim`.\n\n#### Note\n\nIf you prefer to handle disputes programmatically, you can [respond to disputes\nusing the API](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/api).\n\n## Supported currencies\n\nYou can create Amazon Pay payments in the currencies that map to your country.\n\nCountryCurrencyUnited States`usd`Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, France,\nGermany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain,\nSweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom Private preview`aud`, `gbp`, `dkk`, `eur`,\n`hkd`, `jpy`, `nzd`, `nok`, `zar`, `sek`, `chf`, `usd`\n## Available payment methods\n\nUse Amazon Pay to store card credentials.
