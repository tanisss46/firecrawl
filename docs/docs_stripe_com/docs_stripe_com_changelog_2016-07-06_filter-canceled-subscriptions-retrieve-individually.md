# Filter lists of subscriptions for canceled subscriptionsBreaking changes

## What’s new

Updates the list all subscriptions call to also return canceled subscriptions.
The endpoint now supports fetching only canceled subscriptions by specifying
`status=canceled`. You can now retrieve a single canceled subscription by
providing its ID.

## Impact

The `List all subscriptions` call now includes canceled subscriptions and
supports status filtering, offering more comprehensive subscription management.
