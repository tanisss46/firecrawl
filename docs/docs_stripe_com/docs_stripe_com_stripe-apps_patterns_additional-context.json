  "content": "# Additional context for Stripe Apps\n\n## Learn about how additional contexts in onboarding can help users better understand your app.\n\nIf you need to share any additional context before users sign in, dedicate a\nspace for it on a separate screen.\n\n## Before you begin\n\n[Create an app](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/create-app).\n\n## Suggested use\n\n- Use a [FocusView](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/components/focusview)\ncomponent to provide additional context, or to show a\n[demo](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/patterns/demo) screen of how your app\nworks.\n- Make sure the sign in screen is focused on onboarding tasks. Any additional\ncontext should be brief and contextualized. For example:\n\n!\n\n## Example\n\nThe following sample shows additional content displayed within a `SignInView`\ncomponent:\n\n```\nimport {SignInView, Img, Link} from '@stripe/ui-extension-sdk/ui';\nimport appIcon from './icon.svg';\n\nconst Onboarding = () => (\n <SignInView\n description=\"Connect your SuperTodo account with Stripe.\"\n primaryAction={{label: 'Sign in', href: 'https://example.com'}}\n footerContent={\n <>\n Don't have an account? <Link href=\"https://example.com\">Sign up</Link>\n </>\n }\n descriptionActionLabel=\"Learn more\"\n descriptionActionTitle=\"Learn more\"\n descriptionActionContents={\n <>\n <Img href=\"https://example.com/screenshot.png\" />\nTo import existing data from SuperTodo, you will need to connect your SuperTodo\naccount to Stripe.\n </>\n }\n brandColor=\"#635bff\"\n brandIcon={appIcon}\n />\n);\n```\n\n## Links\n\n- [Create an app](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/create-app)\n- [FocusView](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/components/focusview)\n- [demo](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/patterns/demo)",
