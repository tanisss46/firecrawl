  "content": "# Adds proof of ultimate beneficial ownership as a document type\n\n## What’s new\n\nYou can now use the `proof_of_ultimate_beneficial_ownership` document type on\nthe [Accounts API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object) to upload\ndocumentation that identifies [ultimate beneficial\nowners](https://support.stripe.com/questions/beneficial-owner-and-director-definitions)\n(UBOs) of a business. This helps fulfill [Know Your\nCustomer](https://support.stripe.com/questions/know-your-customer-obligations)\n(KYC) requirements.\n\n[Ultimate beneficial\nowners](https://support.stripe.com/questions/beneficial-owner-and-director-definitions)\nare persons that, directly or indirectly, own a significant share or exercise\nsignificant control over your business. These persons are usually represented as\n[owners](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/object#person_object-relationship-owner),\n[directors](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/object#person_object-relationship-director),\nor\n[executives](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/object#person_object-relationship-executive)\non a Stripe account.\n\nTo satisfy UBO requirements, Stripe is required to [identify, collect, and\nverify](https://support.stripe.com/questions/company-beneficial-ownership-and-director-requirement)\nall owners that have a significant ownership stake or control in the business\n(for most businesses, this is defined as having 25% or more ownership). When\nbusinesses are owned by other businesses (holding companies) that have\nsignificant ownership, Stripe is required to identify, collect, and verify all\nsignificant owners of each holding company.\n\nThe proof of ultimate beneficial ownership document type isn’t supported in all\ncountries. Accounts that can use this document type receive the\n`proof_of_ultimate_beneficial_ownership` requirement in their requirements\nfield. If the account supports providing a document for ultimate beneficial\nownership, you can validate the relationship by choosing one document from the\nlist of [Acceptable verification documents by\ncountry](https://docs.stripe.com/acceptable-verification-documents).\n\nAfter [uploading a file](https://docs.stripe.com/file-upload), you can attach it\nto an account:\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts/{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}} \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n-d\n\"documents[proof_of_ultimate_beneficial_ownership][files][]\"=file_5dtoJkOhAxrMWb\n```\n\n## Impact\n\nIf your business has a complex ownership structure or involves foreign holding\ncompanies, the existing KYC fields might not sufficiently capture your company’s\nUBO declaration. The `proof_of_ultimate_beneficial_ownership` document provides\nflexibility by providing an alternative method to comply with KYC requirements.\n\nSome accounts might see a new proof of ultimate beneficial ownership requirement\nas part of the [Upcoming requirement\nupdates](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/upcoming-requirements-updates).\n\n## Changes\n\nREST APIRubyPythonPHPJavaNodeGo.NETParameterChangeResources or\nendpointsproof_of_ultimate_beneficial_ownershipAdded[Account#create.documents](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/create#create_account-documents)[Account#update.documents](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/update#update_account-documents)\n## Upgrade\n\n- [View your current API\nversion](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#view-your-api-version-and-the-latest-available-upgrade-in-workbench)\nin Workbench.\n- If you use an SDK, upgrade to the corresponding SDK version for this API\nversion.- If you don’t use an SDK, update your [API\nrequests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/versioning) to include `Stripe-Version:\n2025-01-27.acacia`\n- Upgrade the API version used for [webhook\nendpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks/versioning).\n- [Test your integration](https://docs.stripe.com/testing) against the new\nversion.\n- If you use Connect, [test your Connect\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/testing).\n- In Workbench, [perform the\nupgrade](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#perform-the-upgrade).
