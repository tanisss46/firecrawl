## Add custom text

You can present additional text to customers when they pay with Stripe Checkout,
such as shipping and processing times.

#### Warning

You’re prohibited from using this feature to create custom text that violates or
creates ambiguity with the Stripe generated text on Checkout, obligations under
your Stripe agreement, Stripe’s policies, and applicable laws.

Custom text after the **Pay** button

Your custom text can be up to 1200 characters in length. However, Stripe
Checkout is optimized for conversion, and adding extra information might affect
your conversion rate. You can bold text or insert a link using [Markdown
syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).

## Customize policies and contact information

You can display your return, refund, and legal policies, and your support
contact information to your customers on Checkout. Go to [Checkout
Settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/checkout) to configure the
information you want to display, including:

- Details about your return and refund policies
- Your support phone number, email, and website
- Links to your terms of service and privacy policy

Presenting this information can increase buyer confidence and minimize cart
abandonment.

### Configure support and legal policies

From [Checkout Settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/checkout), add
support contact information to your sessions by enabling **Contact
information**. Similarly, add links to your **Terms of service** and **Privacy
policy** to your sessions by enabling **Legal policies**. If you require
customers to implicitly consent to your legal policies when they complete their
checkout, select the **Display agreement to legal terms** checkbox.

You must add your support contact information and legal policy links in your
[Public Detail Settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public).

The following previews show how Checkout displays a dialog with the support
contact information, links to the store legal policies, and information about
the payment terms.

### Configure return and refund policies

Display your return, refund, or exchange policies, by enabling **Return and
Refund policies**. Although businesses that sell physical goods use return
policies, businesses that sell digital goods or customized physical goods
typically use refund policies. Because they’re not mutually exclusive, you can
select both options if your business sells both categories of goods. You can
edit your return and refund details, including:

- Whether you accept returns, refunds, or exchanges
- Whether returns, refunds, or exchanges are free or if they’re subject to a fee
- How many days after a purchase you’ll accept returns, refunds, or exchanges
- How customers can return items shipped to them
- Whether you accept in-store returns
- A link to the full return and refund policy
- A custom message

If you accept free returns, refunds, or exchanges, Checkout highlights the
policy for customers.

The following previews show how Checkout displays a return policy. In this
example, it’s for purchases that can be returned by shipping them or in-store
for a full refund (or exchange) for up to 60 days. You can display similar
information for refunds.

### Collect a terms of service agreement

Businesses often require their customers to agree to their terms of service
before they can pay. This might depend on the type of product or subscription.
Checkout helps you collect the necessary agreement by requiring a customer to
accept your terms before paying.

![Collect terms of service
agreement](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/terms-of-service-consent-collection.dec90bde6d1a3c5d4c0b3e7b8e644a52.png)

Collect terms of service agreement

You can collect a terms of service agreement with Stripe Checkout when you
create a Session:

```
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/checkout/sessions \
 -u "sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:" \
 -d "line_items[0][price]"={{PRICE_ID}} \
 -d "line_items[0][quantity]"=2 \
 -d mode=payment \
 --data-urlencode success_url="https://example.com/success" \
 --data-urlencode cancel_url="https://example.com/cancel" \
 -d "consent_collection[terms_of_service]"=required \
--data-urlencode "custom_text[terms_of_service_acceptance][message]"="I agree to
the [Terms of Service](https://example.com/terms)"
```

When `consent_collection.terms_of_service='required'`, Checkout dynamically
displays a checkbox for collecting the customer’s terms of service agreement. If
`consent_collection.terms_of_service='none'`, Checkout won’t display the
checkbox and won’t require customers to accept the terms of service. Before
requiring agreement to your terms, set your terms of service URL in your [public
details](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public) of your business. Setting
a privacy policy URL is optional—Checkout also links to your privacy policy when
a URL to your Privacy policy is set in your [public
details](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public).

After a customer completes checkout, you can verify that the customer accepted
your terms of service by looking at the Session object in the
`checkout.session.completed` webhook, or by retrieving the Session using the
API. When the terms are accepted, the Session’s
[consent.terms_of_service](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object#checkout_session_object-consent)
field is set to `accepted`.

You can customize the text that appears next to the checkbox by using
`custom_text.terms_of_service_acceptance`. You need to set
`consent_collection.terms_of_service='required'`. To use your own terms, insert
a Markdown link. For example: `I agree to the [Terms of
Service](https://example.com/terms)`

#### Warning

Consult your legal and compliance advisors before making any changes to this
text. You can’t use this feature to display custom text that violates or creates
ambiguity with the Stripe-generated text on Checkout, obligations under your
Stripe agreement, Stripe policies, and applicable laws.

### Collect consent for promotional emails

You can send promotional emails to inform customers of new products and to share
coupons and discounts. Before doing so, you must [collect their
consent](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/promotional-emails-consent)
to receive promotional emails.

## Customize payment method reuse agreement

When a session is in either `setup` or `subscription` mode, or is in `payment`
mode with `setup_future_usage` set, Checkout displays a message about reusing
the customer’s payment method. The message can include information specific to
the selected payment method. You can hide or customize the default text, but not
the payment method-specific text.

![Default payment method reuse agreement display in subscription
mode](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/default-subscription-mode-payment-method-reuse-agreement.caee311155d9948637a53aafded801af.png)

Default payment method reuse agreement in subscription mode

#### Warning

By customizing this text, you’re responsible for maintaining compliance, which
includes updating this text as card network rules and local regulations change.
Don’t use this feature without consulting with your legal team or setting custom
text that includes information regarding the reuse of the payment method. Make
sure that your customized text covers all modes you plan to support.

To hide the payment method reuse agreement text, set
`consent_collection.payment_method_reuse_agreement.position='hidden'`. Checkout
won’t display its default language governing the reuse of the payment method. To
set your own text in place of Stripe’s default language, set
`custom_text.after_submit.message`. You can also use `custom_text.submit` or
`custom_text.terms_of_service_acceptance` to display your own version of this
language.

```
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/checkout/sessions \
 -u "sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:" \
 -d "line_items[0][price]"={{PRICE_ID}} \
 -d "line_items[0][quantity]"=1 \
 -d mode=subscription \
 --data-urlencode success_url="https://example.com/success" \
 --data-urlencode cancel_url="https://example.com/cancel" \
 -d "consent_collection[payment_method_reuse_agreement][position]"=hidden \
--data-urlencode "custom_text[after_submit][message]"="You can cancel your
subscription at any time by [logging into your
account](https://www.example.com/)"
```
