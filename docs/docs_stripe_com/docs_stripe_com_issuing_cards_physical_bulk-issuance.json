  "content": "# Bulk issuance\n\n## Ship cards in bulk to one location.\n\nStripe supports bulk issuance, allowing you to order a large number of physical\ncards and have them shipped to a single destination.\n\nBefore you place a bulk shipment, you must verify PCI compliance throughout the\nsupply chain. The recipient of a bulk issuance must meet all applicable PCI\ncertification requirements. For certain specific issuing use cases, Stripe can\ngrant an exception that allows your business to receive its own bulk shipments.\nCheck with your account team to confirm the recipient adheres to the appropriate\nPCI standards necessary for card possession.\n\n## Bulk card issuance\n\nStripe groups all cards with the same shipping destination that are placed on\nthe same day into one bulk shipment.\n\n- Thereâ€™s no limit to the quantity of cards.\n- If the quantity exceeds a few thousand, the shipment is split across multiple\nboxes.\n- There is a maximum of 2,000 cards per box.\n- Each box has its own tracking number.\n- The bulk cost reflected in the [pricing\ntable](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/cards/physical/ship-cards#select-service-type)\nis per box.\n\nSelect bulk issuance for a card:\n\n- **Create a bulk-issued card:** Set the\n[shipping.type](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/create#create_issuing_card-shipping-type)\nproperty to `bulk` in [Create\ncard](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/create) call.\n- **Track bulk shipments:** Upon shipment of each box, Stripe updates the\ntracking number on the corresponding [Card\nobject](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/object). You can listen for\nthe\n[issuing_card.updated](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-issuing_card.updated)\nwebhook to receive notifications when the tracking numbers are assigned.\n\n## Links\n\n- [pricing\ntable](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/cards/physical/ship-cards#select-service-type)\n-\n[shipping.type](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/create#create_issuing_card-shipping-type)\n- [Create card](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/create)\n- [Card object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/object)\n-\n[issuing_card.updated](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-issuing_card.updated)",
