# Charges now have a source field that accepts a source or cardBreaking changes

## What’s new

Replaces the `card` property on the `Charge` object with `source`. As before,
provide this parameter with a `Card` token or with a `Source` token that has an
`object` value of `card`. Older API versions return both the `card` and `source`
properties on `Charge`.

## Impact

Replacing the `card` property on the `Charge` object with `source` broadens
payment source types.
