Stripe\nredirects customers who open this link to a Stripe-hosted payment page.\n\n## Get started\n\nBefore you begin, decide what pricing model works best for you:\n\n- **Products or subscriptions**: Best for e-commerce or SaaS where you’re\nselling products for a fixed price.\n- **Customers choose what to pay**: Best for donations, tipping, or\npay-what-you-want. This pricing model currently doesn’t support recurring\npayments or recurring donations. Learn more about the requirements for\n[accepting tips or\ndonations](https://support.stripe.com/questions/requirements-for-accepting-tips-or-donations).\nProducts or subscriptionsCustomers choose what to pay\nTo let your customers choose what to pay, create a payment link by completing\nthe following steps:\n\n- In the Dashboard, open the [Payment\nLinks](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payment-links/create/customer-chooses-pricing)\npage and click **New** (or click the plus sign () and select **Payment link**).\n- Fill out the payment details.\n- (Optional) Set a preset amount.\n- (Optional) Set minimum and maximum payment amounts. By default, the maximum\npayment amount is 10,000.00 USD. [Contact support](https://support.stripe.com/)\nto increase this limit.\n- Click **Create link**.\n\n## Payment Links on mobile\n\nIf you’re creating a product or subscription, use the [Stripe Dashboard iOS\napp](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id978516833?pt=91215812&ct=stripe-mobile-app-docs-plinks&mt=8)\nto create a payment link on your mobile device. In the app, go to **Payments** >\n**Payment Links** to create a payment link (or click the create icon () and\nselect **Payment link**). The iOS app doesn’t currently support creating links\nwhere your customers choose how much to pay.\n\n## Configure payment methods\n\nWith [Dynamic payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/dynamic-payment-methods),\nStripe displays the most relevant and compatible payment methods to your\ncustomers, including Apple Pay and Google Pay.
