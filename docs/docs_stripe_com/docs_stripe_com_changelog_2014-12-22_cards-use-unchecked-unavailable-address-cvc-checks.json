  "content": "# Cards now use both the unchecked and unavailable values to describe address and CVC checks by issuing banksBreaking changes\n\n## What’s new\n\nUpdates the `Card` object so a value of `unchecked` for the\n`address_line1_check`, `address_zip_check`, or `cvc_check` properties means the\nproperty hasn’t been checked. Previously, it meant the issuing bank didn’t\nsupport the particular check. That state now shows as `unavailable`. Unchecked\nproperties are checked when a card is charged or added to a `Customer` object.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis change allows you to more accurately understand the status of address and\nCVC checks on a `Card` object.\n\n## Upgrade\n\n- [View your current API\nversion](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#view-your-api-version-and-the-latest-available-upgrade-in-workbench)\nin Workbench.\n- If you use an SDK, upgrade to the corresponding SDK version for this API\nversion.- If you don’t use an SDK, update your [API\nrequests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/versioning) to include `Stripe-Version:\n2014-12-22`\n- Upgrade the API version used for [webhook\nendpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks/versioning).\n- [Test your integration](https://docs.stripe.com/testing) against the new\nversion.\n- If you use Connect, [test your Connect\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/testing).\n- In Workbench, [perform the\nupgrade](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#perform-the-upgrade).
