  "content": "# Charges now specify the ID for the dispute associated with a transaction, which can be expandedBreaking changes\n\n## What’s new\n\nUpdates the `dispute` property on the `Charge` object to contain the ID of an\nassociated dispute. Previously, `dispute` contained the entire `Dispute` object.\nYou can [expand this property](https://docs.stripe.com/api#expanding_objects)\nwhen retrieving charges to render the full `Dispute` object as before.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis change simplifies the `Charge` object by replacing the full `Dispute`\nobject with just its ID in the dispute property. You can now access the full\ndispute details by expanding the property when retrieving charges, giving you\nmore control over data retrieval.\n\n## Upgrade\n\n- [View your current API\nversion](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#view-your-api-version-and-the-latest-available-upgrade-in-workbench)\nin Workbench.\n- If you use an SDK, upgrade to the corresponding SDK version for this API\nversion.- If you don’t use an SDK, update your [API\nrequests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/versioning) to include `Stripe-Version:\n2017-02-14`\n- Upgrade the API version used for [webhook\nendpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks/versioning).\n- [Test your integration](https://docs.stripe.com/testing) against the new\nversion.\n- If you use Connect, [test your Connect\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/testing).\n- In Workbench, [perform the\nupgrade](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#perform-the-upgrade).
