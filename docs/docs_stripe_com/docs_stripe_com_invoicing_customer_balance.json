Credit balances are different\nfrom cash balances. Cash balances are connected to the [customer balance payment\nmethod](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bank-transfers). To learn more, see\n[Bank transfer](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/bank-transfer). As explained\nbelow, some features work differently for customers with a cash balance.\n\nEvery customer has a credit balance. You can use this to issue a:\n\n- **Credit adjustment**—You owe the customer money.\n- **Debit adjustment**—The customer owes you money.\n\nThese adjustments sum up to a credit balance that you can apply to future\ninvoices. Because Stripe computes the credit balance from a ledger—an immutable\nlist of debit and credit transactions—it provides an audit trail of transactions\nfor the customer. The [Customer Balance\nTransactions](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_balance_transactions/object)\ncan refer to the object related to the adjustment, such as a [credit\nnote](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/dashboard/credit-notes), invoice, or\n[metadata](https://docs.stripe.com/api/metadata).\n\nSome common use cases for customer credit balances include:\n\n- [Issuing a credit\nnote](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/dashboard/credit-notes#issuing) to\ncreate a credit that reduces the amount due on the next invoice.\n- Marking an invoice as paid and moving the amount owed to the credit balance as\na debit. This happens when the amount due on an invoice is less than the\n[minimum chargeable\namount](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts).\nThis functionality only occurs for users without a [cash\nbalance](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/customer/balance#cash-balances).\n\n## Credit balances\n\nKeep the following in mind when you work with credit balances:\n\n- The credit balance automatically applies to the next finalized invoice to a\ncustomer.\n- You ​​can’t choose a specific invoice to apply the credit balance to.\n- The credit balance is in the customer’s currency.\n- [Customers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers) with a [cash\nbalance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-cash_balance)\ncan’t keep a positive balance. In other words, they can’t increase the amount\ndue on the next invoice.\n\n## Credits and debits\n\nCredits are negative values (a reduction in the amount the customer owes) that\nyou can apply to the next invoice. Debits, on the other hand, are positive\nvalues (an increase in the amount the customer owes) that you can apply to the\nnext invoice.\n\n## Transactions\n\nAll modifications to the credit balance are recorded as\n[Transactions](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_balance_transactions/object).\nAfter you create a transaction, you can only update its `description` or\n`metadata` (you can’t edit other properties or delete it).\n\n### Transaction types\n\nAll\n[Transactions](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_balance_transactions/object)\nthat you create with the API or in the Dashboard have a\n[type](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_balance_transactions/object#customer_balance_transaction_object-type)\nvalue of `adjustment`. A type value of `adjustment` represents a debit or credit\nthat you manually created for the customer. The following table describes each\nof the `type` values:\n\nTypeDescription`adjustment`An explicitly created adjustment transaction to debit\nor credit the credit balance. This is the only type of transaction that you can\ncreate by using API integrations and the Dashboard.`applied_to_invoice`Traces\nthe application of credit against a linked invoice.`credit_note`Traces the\ncreation of credit to a [credit\nnote](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/dashboard/credit-notes) and ​​its\nassociated invoice.`invoice_too_small`When the amount due on an invoice is less\nthan Stripe’s [minimum chargeable\namount](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts)\nand the customer does not have a cash balance, the invoice is debited from the\ncredit balance and added to the amount due on the next\ninvoice.`invoice_too_large`When the amount due on an invoice is greater than\nStripe’s [maximum chargeable\namount](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts)\nand the customer does not have a cash balance, the invoice is debited from the\ncredit balance and added to the amount due on the next\ninvoice.`unapplied_from_invoice`Traces the reversal of an applied credit balance\nfrom a linked invoice. Paired with an earlier ‘applied_to_invoice’\ntransaction.`unspent_receiver_credit`When unspent funds in [receiver\nSources](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#flow-for-customer-action) attached to a\ncustomer without cash balance aren’t fully charged after 60 days, Stripe\nautomatically charges them on your behalf and credits your balance. When this\nhappens, Stripe also creates a corresponding credit\ntransaction.`initial`Represents the starting value of the credit balance when a\ncustomer is created by using the API with a non-zero credit balance.\n### Undo a transaction\n\nYou can only undo a transaction by creating a corresponding, reversing\ntransaction. For example, if you credit the customer ​​10 USD, you’d have to\ndebit them 10 USD in a new transaction, each canceling the other one out.\n\n## Modify the credit balance\n\nYou can modify a customer’s credit balance through both the Dashboard and API.\n\nDashboardAPI\nYou can modify a customer’s credit balance through the [Customers\npage](https://dashboard.stripe.com/customers) in the Dashboard by creating a new\n[Customer Balance\nTransaction](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_balance_transactions/object)\nadjustment.\n\nIn the **Customers** page, click on the customer and then click **Adjust\nbalance** under **Credit balance**. From here, set the **Adjustment type**, a\n**Currency** (only available if the customer doesn’t have a currency set), an\n**Amount**, and an **internal note**.\n\n#### Note\n\nThe **internal note** is only visible to Dashboard users.\n\n!\n\nAdd a new customer balance transaction adjustment\n\n## Balance transaction history\n\nDashboardAPI\nAudit a customer’s balance adjustments in the **Customers** page by scrolling\ndown to the **Credit balance** section. This section displays the current value\nof the customer credit balance.\n\n## Customer cash balances\n\nCustomers using the [bank\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bank-transfers) payment method have\na [cash balance\nobject](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-cash_balance)\nwith one or more currencies in the `available` object. You can use the funds to\n[make\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/customer-balance#make-cash-payment)\nor pay invoices. Customers with available balances have the following behavior:\n\n- You can’t create a negative customer cash balance since it represents money\nsent from the `Customer`.\n- You can’t finalize a too-small or too-large invoice with the cash balance (for\nexample, creating a subscription for 0.01 USD). Learn more about [minimum and\nmaximum\namounts](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts).\n- You can delete `Customers` that have a cash balance, but only if their cash\nbalance is 0.\n- You can’t remove a `Customer`’s available balance.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Stripe data](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data)\n\n## Links\n\n- [invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n- [customer balance payment\nmethod](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bank-transfers)\n- [Bank transfer](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/bank-transfer)\n- [Customer Balance\nTransactions](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_balance_transactions/object)\n- [credit note](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/dashboard/credit-notes)\n- [metadata](https://docs.stripe.com/api/metadata)\n- [Issuing a credit\nnote](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/dashboard/credit-notes#issuing)\n- [minimum chargeable\namount](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts)\n- [Customers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers)\n- [cash\nbalance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-cash_balance)\n-\n[type](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_balance_transactions/object#customer_balance_transaction_object-type)\n- [receiver Sources](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#flow-for-customer-action)\n- [Customers page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/customers)\n- [make\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/customer-balance#make-cash-payment)\n- [Stripe data](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data)",
