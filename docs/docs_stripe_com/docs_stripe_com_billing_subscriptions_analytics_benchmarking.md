# Benchmarking

## Benchmark key billing metrics against similar businesses.

Use the [benchmarking](https://dashboard.stripe.com/billing/benchmarking) page
to evaluate your company’s performance against similar companies that use Stripe
for their subscription business. Review your preset filters to understand your
position relative to your peers, then experiment with different filter
combinations based on what you want to learn. Look for consistent patterns
across months to distinguish trends from anomalies, and use this information to
make strategic decisions about customer acquisition, retention, and expansion.

## Filters

Use filters to customize your benchmarks and compare your company’s performance
against businesses with similar customer bases, growth stages, and subscriber
values.

Adjust the following filters to view different market segments and identify
benchmarks that you want to achieve:

- **ARR**: Annual Recurring Revenue buckets. This filter is preset based on your
business profile.
- **ARPU**: Average Revenue Per User buckets.
- **Business model**: B2B, B2C, or both.

## Chart descriptions

The Dashboard presents four key metrics as 12-month trends:

- **MRR Growth Rate**: This shows your revenue expansion pace, with higher
positive values indicating faster growth.
- **Subscriber Lifetime Value (LTV)**: This represents the total expected
revenue from a customer, with higher values suggesting more valuable
relationships.
- **Net MRR Churn Rate**: This measures revenue retention, with lower or
negative values being better.
- **Subscriber Churn Rate**: This indicates customer retention, where lower
values are preferable.

The chart shows your business metrics compared to the top, median, and bottom
trends of at least 500 similar businesses based on your filter selection. Hover
over the chart to see detailed comparisons at specific intervals in the
timeline.

### Chart pattern analysis

To help you understand and analyze the information in the charts, consider the
following:

- High MRR growth along with high net MRR churn suggests rapid customer
acquisition but retention problems.
- Low subscriber churn with high net MRR churn might indicate customer
downgrades.
- Rising LTV with decreasing churn rates suggests that your customer
satisfaction is improving and your retention strategies might be working.
- High MRR growth with stagnant LTV might indicate acquiring too many
lower-value customers.
