  "content": "# How PaymentIntents work\n\n## Learn how PaymentIntents work within the payment flow.\n\nPayments involving\n[asynchronous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_system) processes can\nbe complex to manage. For example, a user might be required to confirm a payment\nusing [3D Secure](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure). Asynchronous\npayment flows are hard to manage because they depend on customer interactions\nthat happen outside of your application.\n[PaymentIntents](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents) and\n[SetupIntents](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents) simplify management by\ntracking the status of the flow in a *state machine*.\n\nrequires_payment_method\nWhen the PaymentIntent is created, it has a status of `requires_payment_method`1\n[until a payment method is\nattached](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/overview).\n\nWe recommend creating the PaymentIntent as soon as you know how much you want to\ncharge, so that Stripe can record all the attempted payments.\n\nrequires_confirmationOptional\nAfter the customer provides their payment information, the PaymentIntent is\nready to be confirmed.\n\nIn most integrations, this state is skipped because payment method information\nis submitted at the same time that the payment is confirmed.\n\nrequires_action\nIf the payment requires additional actions, such as authenticating with [3D\nSecure](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure), the PaymentIntent has a\nstatus of `requires_action`1.\n\nprocessing\nAfter required actions are handled, the PaymentIntent moves to `processing` for\nasynchronous payment methods, such as bank debits. These types of payment\nmethods can take up to a few days to process. Other payment methods, such as\ncards, are processed more quickly and don’t go into the `processing` status.\n\nIf you’re separately [authorizing and capturing\nfunds](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/place-a-hold-on-a-payment-method), your\nPaymentIntent can instead move to `requires_capture`. In that case, attempting\nto capture the funds moves it to `processing`.\n\nsucceeded\nA PaymentIntent with a status of succeeded means that the payment flow it is\ndriving is complete.\n\nThe funds are now in your account and you can confidently fulfill the order. If\nyou need to refund the customer, you can use the Refunds API.\n\nrequires_payment_method\nIf the payment attempt fails (for example due to a decline), the PaymentIntent’s\nstatus returns to `requires_payment_method` so that the payment can be retried.\n\ncanceled\nYou can cancel a PaymentIntent at any point before it’s in a `processing`2 or\n`succeeded` state. Canceling it invalidates the PaymentIntent for future payment\nattempts, and can’t be undone. If any funds have been held, cancellation\nreleases them.\n\nPaymentIntents might also be automatically transitioned to the `canceled` state\nafter they have been\n[confirmed](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/confirm) too many times.\n\n1 Versions of the API before\n[2019-02-11](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#2019-02-11) show `requires_source`\ninstead of `requires_payment_method` and `requires_source_action` instead of\n`requires_action`.\n\n2 You can cancel a PaymentIntent in the `processing` state when the associated\nPayment Method is US Bank Account. However, it might fail due to a limited and\nvarying cancellation time window.\n\n## Links\n\n- [asynchronous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_system)\n- [3D Secure](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure)\n- [PaymentIntents](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents)\n- [SetupIntents](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents)\n- [until a payment method is\nattached](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/overview)\n- [authorizing and capturing\nfunds](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/place-a-hold-on-a-payment-method)\n- [confirmed](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/confirm)\n- [2019-02-11](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#2019-02-11)",
