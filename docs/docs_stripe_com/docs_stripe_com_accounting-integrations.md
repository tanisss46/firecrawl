# Connect an accounting tool

## Integrate your accounting solution with Stripe.

Bring your Stripe activity, like payments and invoices, into your current
accounting workflow. The NetSuite Connector is a prebuilt solution to sync your
Stripe and NetSuite data. The QuickBooks Desktop guide explains how to download
Stripe data for importing to QuickBooks.

For more options to sync your existing tools with Stripe, see [Stripe
Apps](https://marketplace.stripe.com/).
