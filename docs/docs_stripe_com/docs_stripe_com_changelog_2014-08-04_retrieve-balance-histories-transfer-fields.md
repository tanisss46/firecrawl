# You can now retrieve balance histories rather than relying on Transfer fieldsBreaking changes

## What’s new

Removes the `other_transfers`, `summary`, and `transactions` properties from
automatic transfer responses in favor of `/v1/balance/history`. As of June 20,
2024, these properties are no longer available in any versions, including those
prior to 2014-08-04.

## Impact

Removing these properties from automatic transfer responses in favor of `Balance
history` endpoint centralizes balance information.
