# Income statement

## Learn about the income statement report.

The income statement provides a detailed revenue and contra revenue breakdown by
month. It shows revenue, contra revenue, expenses, gains, and losses. Contra
revenue adjustments are deductions from gross revenue. Applying the contra
revenue to your gross revenue results in your net income. Use this report to
better understand your net revenue and determine how you want to track contra
revenue items.

The report is available to download from our [accounting
reports](https://dashboard.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/accounting-reports)
page with multiple format options.

## Replication in Sigma

To replicate the income report in
[Sigma](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data/access-data-in-dashboard), use the
`revenue_recognition_debits_and_credits` table.

### Group By Account

This sample query generates the report for revenue booked for the accounting
period of October 2023 and grouped by account. You can adjust the dates to your
desired time frame as well as different grouping parameters.

### Group By Line Item

This sample query generates the report for revenue booked for the accounting
period of Feb 2024 and grouped by line item. You can adjust the dates to your
desired time frame as well as different grouping parameters.

To retrieve customer address information, join the results of this Sigma query
with the
[invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data/query-billing-data#invoices)
Sigma table.

#### Note

If youâ€™re using our [chart of
accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/chart-of-accounts) beta
feature, be sure to update the `unbilled_ar_accounts` mapping in the query below
to reflect the accounts in your general ledger.
