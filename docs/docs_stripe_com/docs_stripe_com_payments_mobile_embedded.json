For example, you can use the\nEmbedded Payment Element to:\n\n- Display the payment method options directly on your checkout screen, allowing\nusers to view and select their payment method without the need for a separate\nsheet.\n- Integrate the payment method list into your existing payment methods screen\nwith other items like coupon selection.\n\nFor developers seeking a prebuilt and customizable solution for payment\nprocessing, use the [Payment\nSheet](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements/mobile-payment-element#integration-options)\ninstead. If you require additional control over where to place the payment\nmethod list, use the Embedded Payment Element.
