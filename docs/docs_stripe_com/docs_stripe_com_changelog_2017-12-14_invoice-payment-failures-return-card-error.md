# Invoice payment failures now return a card_error when a charge is declinedBreaking changes

## What’s new

Updates invoice payment attempts to return a `card_error` when the charge is
declined. This aligns `/v1/invoices/{INVOICE_ID}/pay` with `/v1/charges`.

## Impact

This change aligns the error handling of invoice payment attempts with that of
direct charges, returning a `card_error` when a charge is declined. You can now
expect consistent error responses across different payment endpoints, improving
error handling and debugging processes.
