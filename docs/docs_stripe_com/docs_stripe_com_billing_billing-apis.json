Use the Customer object associated with a\nsubscription to make and track recurring charges and to manage the products that\nthey subscribe\nto.[Entitlement](https://docs.stripe.com/api/entitlements/active-entitlement)Represents\na customer’s access to a feature included in a service product that they\nsubscribe to. When you create a subscription for a customer’s recurring purchase\nof a product, an active entitlement is automatically created for each feature\nassociated with that product. When a customer accesses your services, use their\nactive entitlements to enable the features included in their\nsubscription.[Feature](https://docs.stripe.com/api/entitlements/feature)Represents\na function or ability that your customers can access when they subscribe to a\nservice product. You can include features in a product by creating\nProductFeatures.[Invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)A statement of\namounts a customer owes that tracks payment statuses from draft through paid or\notherwise finalized. Subscriptions automatically generate\ninvoices.[PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents)A way to\nbuild dynamic payment flows. A PaymentIntent tracks the lifecycle of a customer\ncheckout flow and triggers additional authentication steps when required by\nregulatory mandates, custom Radar fraud rules, or redirect-based payment\nmethods. Invoices automatically create\nPaymentIntents.[PaymentMethod](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods)A\ncustomer’s payment instruments that they use to pay for your products. For\nexample, you can store a credit card on a Customer object and use it to make\nrecurring payments for that customer. Typically used with the Payment Intents or\nSetup Intents APIs.[Price](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices)Defines the unit\nprice, currency, and billing cycle for a\nproduct.[Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/products)A good or service that\nyour business sells. A service product can include one or more\nfeatures.[ProductFeature](https://docs.stripe.com/api/product-feature)Represents\na single feature’s inclusion in a single product. Each product is associated\nwith a ProductFeature for each feature that it includes, and each feature is\nassociated with a ProductFeature for each product that includes\nit.[Subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions)Represents a\ncustomer’s scheduled recurring purchase of a product. Use a subscription to\ncollect payments and provide repeated delivery of or continuous access to a\nproduct.\nHere’s an example of how products, features, and entitlements work together.\nImagine that you want to set up a subscription service that offers two tiers: a\nstandard product with basic functionality, and an advanced product that adds\nextended functionality.\n\n- You create two features: `basic_features` and `extended_features`.\n- You create two products: `standard_product` and `advanced_product`.\n- For the standard product, you create one ProductFeature that associates\n`basic_features` with `standard_product`.\n- For the advanced product, you create two ProductFeatures: one that associates\n`basic_features` with `advanced_product` and one that associates\n`extended_features` with `advanced_product`.\n\nA customer, `first_customer`, subscribes to the standard product. When you\ncreate the subscription, Stripe automatically creates an Entitlement that\nassociates `first_customer` with `basic_features`.\n\nAnother customer, `second_customer`, subscribes to the advanced product. When\nyou create the Subscription, Stripe automatically creates two Entitlements: one\nthat associates `second_customer` with `basic_features`, and one that associates\n`second_customer` with `extended_features`.\n\nYou can determine which features to provision for a customer by [retrieving\ntheir active entitlements or listening to the Active Entitlement Summary\nevent](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/entitlements#entitlements). You don’t\nhave to retrieve their subscriptions, products, and features.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating)\n- [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n- [Payment Intents](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents)\n- [Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/products)\n- [Price](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices)\n- [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers)\n- [Payment Methods](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods)\n- [Subscription object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object)\n- [Invoice object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object)\n- [PaymentMethod object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object)\n- [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents)\n- [Entitlement](https://docs.stripe.com/api/entitlements/active-entitlement)\n- [Feature](https://docs.stripe.com/api/entitlements/feature)\n- [ProductFeature](https://docs.stripe.com/api/product-feature)\n- [Subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions)\n- [retrieving their active entitlements or listening to the Active Entitlement\nSummary event](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/entitlements#entitlements)",
