This allows you to identify which Stripe record corresponds to a\nNetSuite record. The connector doesn’t use the memo field in NetSuite and adds\nnotes for informational purposes only. You can safely wipe or override the memo\nfield on any created records.\n\nThe connector stores additional information in the memo field for a NetSuite\nrecord in the following cases:\n\n- If you modify a transaction date, the memo includes the original transaction\ndate. This ensures successful translation of the record. For example, `Original\ntransaction date: 2023-04-01`.\n- If a charge isn’t associated with an invoice or order, the customer payment\nmemo includes the charge description. For example, `Stripe description: charge\nfor invoice 12345`.\n- If an invoice increases a customer’s balance, the NetSuite invoice includes\nthe amount.\n- If a credit memo represents an invoice payment from a customer’s balance, the\ncredit memo includes the payment.\n\n## NetSuite external IDs\n\nThe external ID for every Stripe-created NetSuite record is set to the ID of the\ncorresponding Stripe record. This allows you to retrieve a record from NetSuite\nusing the Stripe record ID.\n\nIn some exceptions, the external ID is prefixed:\n\n- **Credit memos**: The external ID is prefixed with `ns_memo:`. For example, if\nthe refund ID is `re_abcd`, the credit memo external ID is `ns_memo:re_abcd`.\n- **Discount items for Stripe prices**: The external ID is prefixed with the ID\nof the price object that the discount is applied to.\n\nIf you have other integrations in your NetSuite instance, make sure not to\noverwrite the external IDs that Stripe sets on records.\n\n## NetSuite record fields\n\nThe connector uses the NetSuite record fields listed below, by default. These\nfields must exist on the custom forms used for any records that the connector\ncreates or uses.\n\nRecordFieldsNotesInvoice (read only)- amountRemaining\n- status\n- currency\n- custbody_suitesync_authorization_code\n- tranId\n- memo\n- createdFrom\n- entity\n- externalId\nThe `amountRemaining` is also called Amount Due.CustomerexternalIdCreditMemo-\nmemo\n- currency\n- custbody_suitesync_authorization_code\n- line items sub-list\nCustomerPayment- memo\n- currency\n- paymentMethod\n- account\n- payment\n- tranDate\nAlways set the `tranDate` to the exact date of the transaction in Stripe. Set\nthe `paymentMethod` to the Stripe payment method (automatically created in your\naccount). The connector sets the `account` to the undeposited funds\naccount.CustomerRefund- memo\n- currency\n- tranDate\n- paymentMethod\n- account\nAlways set the `tranDate` to the exact date of the transaction in Stripe.
