Administrators can\nupdate the team by adding or removing members, and changing the roles assigned\nto members. You can view all team members, and filter their activity in the\nsecurity history. You can also manage two-factor authentication settings for an\nindividual or the whole team.\n\n## Two-factor authentication controls\n\nStripe supports two-factor authentication (2FA) through TouchID, security key,\nSMS, and authenticator apps, such as Google Authenticator. As an additional\nsecurity measure, we recommend that all users register for 2FA.\n\n### Require 2FA for all users in an organization\n\nTo require 2FA for Organization users, you must assign the Administrator or\nSuper Administrator roles:\n\n- Navigate to the [User\nAuthentication](https://dashboard.stripe.com/org/settings/security/authentication)\npage.\n- Enable **Require two-step authentication for all team members**.\n\nAfter you enable this option, all users must register a 2FA device during their\nnext login, which requires them to complete a 2FA challenge during all\nsubsequent login attempts.\n\n### Reset 2FA for a single user\n\nIf a single user loses access to their 2FA devices, an Administrator or Super\nAdministrator must reset the compromised user’s 2FA settings from the\naccount-level:\n\n- Navigate to the [Team](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/team) page of an\naccount.\n- Click the compromised user’s name.\n- Click **Reset two-factor authentication**.\n\nStripe sends an email to the compromised user’s registered email address with\ninstructions on how they can reset their 2FA devices. This can’t be done on the\norganization-level management user detail’s page.\n\n## View and filter your security history\n\nTo view your security-related events, navigate to the [Security\nhistory](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/security_history) page. You can\nfilter your security filter by date, user, action type, and so on. Your\nuser-based security history filters include:\n\n- IP Address\n- User\n- API Key\n- Device\n\n**Action filters** categorize hundreds of different actions based on product\nareas (for example, Billing, Radar, or Checkout). You can export your security\nhistory as a **CSV** file.\n\n## Team management\n\n### Organization-level and account-level roles\n\nFor every account you have access to, you must assign users either an\norganization-level or account-level role. Organization-level roles grant users\naccess to all accounts within the organization, including the organization\nitself. Account-level roles allow users to access a specific assigned account\nwith the assigned role.\n\nSay your organization contains three accounts: Banking, Finance, and Consulting.\nIn this scenario, you can assign the following roles:\n\n- **Organization-level role**: If you assign a user the “IAM Administrator”\nrole, they possess that role in all three accounts, as well as within the\norganization itself. This grants them access to team management for all three\naccounts, in addition to organization-level team management.\n- **Account-level role**: If you assign a user the “IAM Administrator” role in\nthe Banking account, their access is limited solely to the IAM role within the\nBanking account. They can manage account-level teams exclusively within that\naccount. However, this role doesn’t grant access to other accounts or\norganization-level team management.\n\n## Differences in team management with Organizations\n\nUse Stripe Organizations to manage your team either at the organization-level\n*or* at the account-level.\n\n- **Manage your team for an account**: Add, remove, and edit team members of an\naccount, and update the roles of users associated with that account, on the\n[Team and security](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/team) page.\n- **Manage your team for an organization**: Manage user access and roles for\nspecific accounts on the [Team](https://dashboard.stripe.com/org/settings/team)\npage. From here, you can also manage team members by granting access to multiple\naccounts simultaneously or providing access to the entire organization. You can\nonly access this page if you have an organization-level role.\nOrganization-level managementAccount-level management\nYou can view all of the team members within your organization in the\n[Team](https://dashboard.stripe.com/org/settings/team) page. Additionally, you\ncan:\n\n- Invite new members directly.\n- Edit members.\n- Grant members access to additional accounts.\n- Select the specific accounts that you want to grant access to.\n- Remove members from your organization.\n\n### Add a team member\n\nTo add a new team member:\n\n- Navigate to the [Team](https://dashboard.stripe.com/org/settings/team) page.\n- Click **Add Member**.\n- Add the email address of the user you want to invite.

You can give multiple roles to a single user within\nthe same account.\n- Select the accounts that you want to give this user access to. You can select\nindividual accounts, or grant access to the entire organization. Org-level\naccess gives users access to all accounts within the organization, and access to\nthe organization itself.\n- Click **Send Invites** to send the email with the steps for creating their\nStripe Account.\n\n### Remove a team member\n\nTo remove an existing team member:\n\n- Navigate to the [Team](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/team) page.\n- Click the user’s profile from the list of team members.\n- Click the overflow menu ().\n- Click **Remove member** to cancel this users’ access to this Stripe account\nimmediately.
