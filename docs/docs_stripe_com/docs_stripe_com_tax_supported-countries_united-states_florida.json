Stripe also\nnotifies you with email and Dashboard alerts when you need to register to\ncollect tax. Learn more about how the [monitoring tool\nworks](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/monitoring).\n\n### Sales tax\n\nRemote sellers must register to collect and remit tax in Florida when, in the\nprevious calendar year, they exceed a sales threshold of 100,000 USD.\n\nThe threshold includes taxable sales. The threshold excludes nontaxable sales,\nwholesale sales (sales of resale), and marketplace sales.\n\n### Other taxes\n\nWe also support:\n\n- [Florida Communications Services\ntax](https://floridarevenue.com/taxes/taxesfees/Pages/cst.aspx)—for businesses\nselling video or audio streaming to customers in Florida. This includes the\nCommunications Services Tax, Communications Services Gross Receipts Tax and\nLocal Communications Services Tax. These taxes only apply when your business has\nphysical presence in Florida. This means there isn’t a revenue threshold for\nwhen remote sellers need to pay this tax. Transactions for these taxes aren’t\nincluded in Stripe monitoring for Florida.\n\n## Register to collect tax\n\nRegister for tax in Florida at the [tax\nauthority](https://floridarevenue.com/taxes/taxesfees/Pages/sales_tax.aspx).\nRead more about registering for [sales tax in the US in our\nguide](https://stripe.com/guides/sales-tax-registration-process-us). You can\nalso use [Stripe to\nregister](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/use-stripe-to-register) on your behalf.\n\nAfter you’ve registered to collect tax in Florida, go to\n[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations?location=us-fl)\nto add your registrations to Stripe in the Dashboard. This turns on tax\ncalculation and collection in Stripe for your transactions in Florida.\n\nLearn [how to add your\nregistration](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/registering#track-your-registrations-in-the-tax-dashboard)\nin the Dashboard.\n\n## How we calculate taxes\n\nStripe calculates the taxes that apply to your customer’s location.\n\n## Report and file your taxes\n\nStripe provides reports of your completed tax transactions. Go to\n[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations) to access these\nreports.\n\n### Exports\n\nThe tax transaction data export provides a comprehensive and aggregated view of\ntransactions by location, including a breakdown of individual tax amounts. Learn\nmore about [tax reporting exports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports#exports).\n\n### Location reports\n\n[Location reports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports#us-location-reports)\noffer a summary of transaction and refund data for specific US locations and\nalign with Florida filing requirements. You have the option to report on an\nannual, semiannual, quarterly, or monthly basis.\n\nReporting-specific considerations:\n\n- Certain areas in Florida can impose an extra sales surtax, but there is a set\nlimit on how much tax will be applied based on the transaction amount. You won’t\nsee a location report for Florida if you had these transactions. Use the\n[exports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports#exports) instead for a detailed\ntax breakdown of each transaction.\n- The location reports don’t include transactions with the Florida\nCommunications Services tax as these are filed to the state using a different\nreport. To see transactions with these taxes, you can use the\n[exports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports#exports).\n\n### Filing\n\nStripe Tax has filing partners—Taxually, Marosa, and Hands-off Sales Tax\n(HOST)—to help automate your tax filing. These partners automatically sync your\ntax transaction data in real time, eliminating the need for manual data entry or\nfile transfers.
