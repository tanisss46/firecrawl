# File and remit

## Learn about filing and remitting tax.

#### Note

If you work for a platform that pays you via Stripe you’ll need a 1099 form to
file your taxes. Visit the [support
site](https://support.stripe.com/express/topics/1099-tax-forms) to learn more
about how to verify your tax information and receive your forms

If you’re a business collecting tax, you must file and remit the tax collected
in every location that you’re [registered
in](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/registering). The tax authority in each location
determines the rules for reporting and filing taxes. For example, some states in
the US want businesses to report at the city, county, or other level when
filing, whereas others only need information at a more consolidated or state
level. Additionally, each location mandates their own method and timing of
remittance, and can vary depending on your volume of sales into that location

## Filing frequency

The local tax authority specifies the tax filing frequency during the tax
collection registration process. Depending on your specific requirements, you
might need to remit tax monthly, annually, or on another designated frequency.
Filing frequencies can vary based on factors such as annual revenue and other
considerations. Contact your local tax authority to confirm your filing
frequency, if you’re uncertain.

## Refunds

Exports and reports include refunds. If you issue a refund of tax when your
customer returns a purchase, local tax authorities might require an amendment to
the original tax return to process the refund. To claim the refund on your tax
return, reach out to your local tax authority.

## Filing with Stripe

Stripe Tax works with select filing partners that help automate much of the tax
filing process to reduce manual work and eliminate potential errors. Stripe
partners with three solutions: Taxually, Marosa, and Hands-off Sales Tax. Each
partner caters to different geographical needs and business types.

#### Note

For US-based businesses, integrated filing is only available as part of a Stripe
Tax subscription. Check your plan in the Dashboard under [Stripe
plans](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/plans/tax/choose).

## Benefits of automated filing

- Real-time data synchronization: The integration automatically syncs
transaction data between Stripe and the filing partner. This removes the need
for manual data entry, imports, or exports, and helps you file on-time.
- Tax calculation and filing: Stripe Tax handles all tax calculations. The
filing partner then uses this data to prepare and submit tax returns for you,
eliminating any discrepancies that can arise from using multiple tax engines.
