Check the [API\nresponses](https://dashboard.stripe.com/workbench/logs) for more details about\nwhy the tax rate is zero.\n\n## Multiple taxes\n\nWhen you create an order, you might see multiples of the same tax amount. This\nisn’t an error. Occasionally multiple taxes exist with the same name and same\namount that apply to a single line item.\n\nYou can choose to display a single total tax amount to your customers. To do so,\nnavigate to **Settings** > **Tax** in your WooCommerce app, and select **As a\nsingle total** for **Display tax totals**.\n\n## Transactions in Stripe reports\n\nIf you can’t see transactions in your Stripe reports, make sure your\n[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/dashboard) isn’t in Test mode.\n\nAfter your customer completes their purchase and the connector records the\ntransaction, you can expect a delay of a few minutes before the transaction\nappears in the Stripe reports in your Dashboard.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Install the\nconnector](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/woocommerce/installation)\n- [Configure the\nconnector](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/woocommerce/configuration)\n\n## Links\n\n-\n[registration](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/woocommerce/configuration#tax-registrations)\n- [configured and\nconnected](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/woocommerce/configuration#connect-stripe-account)\n- [API responses](https://dashboard.stripe.com/workbench/logs)\n- [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/dashboard)\n- [Install the\nconnector](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/woocommerce/installation)\n- [Configure the\nconnector](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/woocommerce/configuration)",
