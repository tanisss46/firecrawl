When you use Radar with connected accounts, it\nchecks only external charges. It doesn’t check fund transfers between Stripe\naccounts.\n\n[Charges in a Connect\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges#types) fall into two\ncategories:\n\n- **Direct charges**: Paid directly to a connected account; Stripe applies only\nthe collecting account’s Radar configuration and rules\n- **Transferred charges** (for example, destination charges or separate charges\nand transfers): Paid to the platform account and transferred to a connected\naccount; Stripe applies only the platform account’s Radar configuration and\nrules\n\n## Radar fees\n\nStripe charges Radar fees based on the rate for the account that collected the\npayment. For payments collected by the platform account and transferred to a\nconnected account, you can pass Radar fees to the connected account by reducing\nthe transferred amount.\n\n## Radar configuration for a connected account\n\nThe Dashboard you use to configure Radar for a connected account depends on the\nconnected account type. The following table shows which Dashboard to use for\neach account type.\n\nDashboard access of the connected account Connected account Dashboard Platform\naccount Dashboard Connect page Connected accounts with access to the Stripe\nDashboard Connected accounts with access to the Express Dashboard Connected\naccounts with no dashboard access\n## Radar behavior\n\nRadar behavior for connected account payments depends on the charge category and\nconnected account type.
