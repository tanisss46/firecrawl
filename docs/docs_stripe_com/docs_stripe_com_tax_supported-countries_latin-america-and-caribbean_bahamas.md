# Collect tax in the Bahamas

## Learn how to use Stripe Tax to calculate, collect, and report tax in the Bahamas.

In the Bahamas, Stripe only supports collecting VAT for digital services. In
Stripe, these are referred to as “digital products.” To collect this tax on
Stripe, you must be a remote seller without a physical presence in the country.

## When to register for tax collection

See [Thresholds](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/thresholds) to get insights
about your potential tax registration obligations in the Bahamas. Stripe also
notifies you with email and Dashboard alerts when you need to register to
collect tax. Learn more about how the [monitoring tool
works](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/monitoring).

Remote sellers providing digital goods or electronically supplied services
(digital products) to consumers or businesses in the Bahamas must register for
VAT from the first sale.

- **Threshold**: 1 transaction
- **Included transactions**: Business-to-consumer (B2C) and Business-to-business
(B2B) sales of digital goods or electronically supplied services (digital
products)

## How we calculate taxes

We only support calculations for [digital
products](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes?type=digital) (non-physical
items or services that are delivered, given, or rendered electronically) in the
Bahamas. Stripe doesn’t calculate tax for products that don’t use a digital
product tax code.

View the list of supported [digital product tax
codes](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes?type=digital). To calculate taxes
in the Bahamas, make sure that you [assign a tax
code](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/products-prices-tax-codes-tax-behavior#tax-code-on-product)
to each of your products.

## Report and file your taxes

Stripe provides reports of your completed tax transactions. Go to
[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations) to access these
reports. Learn more about [the different types of
reports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports).

You’re responsible for filing and remitting your taxes to Bahamas. Stripe
doesn’t file taxes on your behalf.
