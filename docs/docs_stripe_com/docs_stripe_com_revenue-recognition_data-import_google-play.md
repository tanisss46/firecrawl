# Stripe Connector for Google Play

## Manage your revenue recognition in Stripe by importing data from Google Play.

[Stripe’s Connector for Google
Play](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data/import-external-data/connectors/google-play)
lets you import subscription purchases from Google Play into Stripe Revenue
Recognition automatically.

Some benefits of using Revenue Recognition for Google Play include:

- **Near real-time availability**: Set up daily, automated imports from Google
Play. This minimizes manual work and reduces corrections at month-end.
- **Improved refund treatment**: Link refunds to original purchases, and
generate more accurate refund journal entries that adjust deferred revenue
instead of treating refunds as negative line items.
- **Audit by order**: Break down numbers on a transactional basis to help with
audits.

## Get started

To import data from Google Play, [set up Stripe’s Connector for Google
Play](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data/import-external-data/connectors/google-play).
It can take up to 24 hours for your reports to reflect imported data.

### Backfill historical data

When you onboard, the Connector backfills up to 1 year of historical data.

### Handle Google transactions previously imported through manual data import

If you previously imported data from Google Play using Revenue Recognition’s
[data
import](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/data-import#general-import)
feature, you want to avoid double-counting Google revenue upon switching to the
automated Connector.

To migrate from manual data imports to the Google Play Connector,
[delete](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/data-import/manage-imported-data#transactions-deletion)
all Google transactions from the past year that you uploaded manually through
data import CSVs. The Connector import then replaces these deleted entries.

#### Limit deletions to 1 year of history

Don’t delete data import CSV uploads for Google transactions that occurred more
than 1 year ago because the Connector only backfills up to 1 year of historical
data.

## Examples

The following examples show how the Google Play Connector might record revenue
in different scenarios.

### Subscription purchase

On December 3, a subscriber purchases 1 unit of a “News Plan Monthly”
subscription.

- The subscription is valid for a month, which means the service period is from
Dec 3 to Jan 3.
- The customer pays 31 USD.

At the end of January, the summary might show:

AccountDecemberJanuaryExternal Asset+31Revenue+28+3Deferred Revenue+3-3- Revenue
gets billed and paid in full on December 3.
- The bulk of the revenue is recognized in December, with a smaller part
recognized in January.

### Subscription refund

On January 2, a subscriber purchases a three-month subscription that costs 90
USD.

- The service period is Jan 2 - April 2.
- On February 1, the customer receives a full refund, meaning:- The customer
gets their money back.
- Recognized revenue is offset by the refund in a contra revenue account.
- The unused part of the subscription revenue gets cleared from the deferred
revenue.

In this case, the refund reduces the external assets balance by 90 USD. The
customer received 30 days of service, so you must add 30 USD back to the
external refunds balance. The remainder of the deferred revenue, 60 USD in this
case, is also cleared. At the end of April, the summary might show:

AccountDecemberJanuaryRevenue+30Deferred Revenue+60-60External
Asset+90-90External Refunds+30
### Free trial

Stripe doesn’t generate journal entries for free trials.

## Limitations

Revenue Recognition doesn’t support withholding taxes or commission fees
reported by Google.
