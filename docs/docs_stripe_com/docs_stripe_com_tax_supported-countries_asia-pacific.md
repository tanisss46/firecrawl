## When and how to register for tax collection

There are different rules for when and how you need to register to collect tax
depending on the country. Click the links above to learn about the thresholds
for tax collection in each location.

See [Thresholds](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/thresholds) to get insights
about your potential tax registration obligations in each location. Stripe only
monitors if you have reached a tax threshold for sales outside of the country
your business is based in. Stripe also notifies you with email and Dashboard
alerts when you need to register to collect tax. Learn more about how the
[monitoring tool works](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/monitoring).

Stripe can collect tax if your business is based in Australia, Hong Kong, Japan,
New Zealand and Singapore. Your business needs to be a remote seller with no
physical presence (such as a shop or warehouse) to collect tax on Stripe in the
other countries listed above.

After you’ve registered with a country, go to
[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations) to add your
registrations to Stripe in the Dashboard to start collecting tax on your
transactions in that location.

## How we calculate taxes

Stripe can calculate tax for [any of the product tax codes you assign to your
products](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes) and for domestic and
cross-border sales in Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, New Zealand and Singapore.
For the other countries listed, Stripe only supports calculation for [digital
products](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes?type=digital) sold by remote
sellers.

### Domestic transactions

A transaction where your business and your customer are in the same country is
called a domestic transaction. Stripe assumes the sale of most goods or services
to be taxable unless the tax authority has specifically made them exempt.

### Cross border transactions

A cross-border transaction is where your customer is located in a different
country to your business or when goods are shipped from one country to another.

Stripe calculates tax on a cross-border transaction taking into account the
following factors:

- the location of your business
- the tax registrations you’ve added to Stripe
- the location of the buyer
- the type of the product sold (based on which [product tax
code](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes) you assigned to your product)
- the status of the customer (whether they’re an individual or a business)

#### Digital products

Digital products are non-physical items or services that are delivered, given,
or rendered electronically. This includes digital goods and electronically
supplied services. We determine whether you’re selling digital products or
physical goods using the [product tax
code](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes) you assigned to your product.

Digital products are generally taxable in the country where your customer is
located. However sales of digital products to businesses in other countries
might have reverse charge applied. With reverse charge, your business provides
an invoice for the purchase so that your customer can calculate the tax.

#### Physical goods

When physical goods are shipped to a customer in a different country to your
business, the transaction is referred to as an export. Exports are zero rated
and Stripe applies the [zero rate](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/zero-tax). The
transaction might still be subject to taxes and customs duties in the country
your customer is in. Stripe doesn’t calculate these.

## Report and file your taxes

Stripe provides reports of your completed tax transactions. Go to
[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations) to access these
reports. Learn more about [the different types of
reports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports).

You’re responsible for filing and remitting your taxes. Stripe doesn’t file
taxes on your behalf.
