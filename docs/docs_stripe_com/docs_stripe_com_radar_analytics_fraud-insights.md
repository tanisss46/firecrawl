# Fraud insights

## Review fraud trends specific to your business so you can tailor your strategy.

Building an effective fraud fighting strategy requires understanding the
specific drivers of fraud for your business. If you use [Radar for Fraud
Teams](https://docs.stripe.com/radar), you can access the
[Insights](https://dashboard.stripe.com/radar/insights) tab of the Radar page in
your Dashboard to:

- Visualize the ratio of fraudulent and legitimate transactions across your
payments.
- Identify combinations of Radar attributes that have material impact on your
fraud rates.
- Adjust your Radar rules to effectively balance fraud prevention and legitimate
customer conversion.

## Configure your data set

You can specify the time period analyzed and what types of payment activity
constitute fraud to further customize your results.

### Specify the time period

By default, we display statistics in near real-time for the prior 30 days of
transaction history. To see data for a different time period:

- Click the **Date** filter to open the time period editor.
- Use the dropdown to choose a relative comparator.
- Depending on the comparator you choose, set the parameters, such as *in the
last 1 months* or *between 2/26/2024 and 3/18/2024*.
- Choose your local time zone or Greenwich Mean Time (UTC).
- Click **Apply**.

### Configure your fraud definition

Click **Configure** to choose which types of transactions to include as
fraudulent in your Insights statistics.

- **All fraudulent transactions**: Payments disputed for fraud, reported as
early fraud warning (EFW), or refunded as fraud
- **Only disputes**: Any disputed payment, regardless of
[category](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/categories)
- **Only fraudulent disputes**: Disputed payments in the fraud category
- **Only early fraud warnings**: Issuer-flagged suspicious payment
[EFWs](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/how-disputes-work#early-fraud-warnings)

## Evaluate your fraud markers

Stripe analyzes all the payments for the specified time period, then presents:

- A summary of the total fraudulent and legitimate payments for the time period.
- A table of the top rule attribute values that suggest a correlation with
fraud, based on the ratio of fraudulent to legitimate payments.

The summary and each attribute in the table provide the following statistics:

StatisticDescriptionFraud percentageThe percentage of fraudulent payment volume
where this rule attribute was present.Legitimate percentageThe percentage of
legitimate payment volume where this rule attribute was present.Fraud volumeThe
total amount of the fraudulent payments where this rule attribute was
present.Legitimate volumeThe total amount of the legitimate payments where this
rule attribute was present.Fraud countThe total number of fraudulent payments
where this rule attribute was present.Legitimate countThe total number of
legitimate payments where this rule attribute was present.

## Use filters to discover high-risk attribute combinations

You can add any of the attribute values presented as your top fraud indicators
as a filter. Doing so adjusts the table to show a new set of top attribute
values that corresponded to fraud *in combination with the filtered rule
attribute value*. Continue applying filters in this way to find a combination of
rule attribute values that block transactions with the attributes you desire.

For example, say your top indicator shows that 19% of fraudulent payment volume
had Delaware as the billing state. Blocking all payments from Delaware isn’t
sensible, but to further explore through filters, you might take the following
steps:

- Filter on “billing state is Delaware” and identify which other rule attributes
corresponded most to fraud when the billing state is Delaware. In this case, you
find that 42% of fraudulent payment volume where Delaware is the billing state
has a shipping state that isn’t Delaware. That’s only 8% of the total fraudulent
payment volume, and blocking all payments with billing state Delaware and a
different shipping state is too aggressive, so you continue.
- Add “shipping state is not Delaware” as a second filter. Applying both filters
and looking at the resulting fraudulent payment volume reveals that 75% of it
involves payments of greater than 500 USD. This amounts to 6% of the total
fraudulent payment volume.
- Add “payment amount greater than 500 USD” as a third filter. Comparing the
results of all three filters to total payment volumes shows 6% of all fraudulent
payment volume, but only 0.1% of all legitimate payment volume.
- At this point, you might set up a rule to block payments of over 500 USD that
have Delaware as the billing state and a different state for shipping. You can
expect that rule to block 6% of fraudulent payment volume and only 0.1% of
legitimate payment volume.

As the example illustrates, you can apply a series of filters to determine a set
of rule attribute values that together identify a material percentage of
fraudulent payment volume. When that set also reflects a low percentage of
legitimate payment volume, a rule to block those values can effectively reduce
fraud while having limited impact on legitimate payments.

### Customize filters

![Example chart about the risk score
attribute](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fraud-insights-custom-filter.09750cf1a92546047e0f096bf5585f5b.png)

You can also create a filter without using the rule attributes presented in the
table.

- Click **More filters**.
- Choose the rule attribute that you want to create a filter for.
- Depending on the attribute you choose, set the parameters, such as *Risk score
is greater than 15* or *Card bin is 4242*.
- Click **Apply**.

## Create a rule

When you assemble the set of filters that represent your optimum ratio between
blocking the most risky transactions without compromising legitimate payments,
you can automatically create a rule to prevent payments where all the selected
attributes exist simultaneously.

- Click **Add block rule** to slide open the rule editor.
- Check that the rule accurately reflects the attributes you filtered.
- (Optional) Augment the rule to include other attributes or your own custom
metadata, such as product codes or retail locations. Try [Radar
Assistant](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules#how-to-create-effective-rules) to
generate a rule based on your natural language prompts.
- Click **Test rule**.
- If necessary, correct any validation errors and retest.
- On the **Review new rule** page, review how this rule performs against your
recent transactions to confirm whether you want to enable it.
- Click **Add rule** to begin applying this rule to all future transactions.

filters](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fraud-insights-create-rule.a985df06aaeac7f3d30eb9426922bd8f.png)

## Inspect charts

You can find visualizations of the attributes identified as your top drivers of
fraud below the table of your most common fraud indicators. Each chart shows the
percentages of total fraudulent and legitimate payment volume associated with
given values of the attribute over a [specified time
period](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/analytics/fraud-insights#specify-the-time-period).

#### Note

The charts represent percentages of total payment volumes, not percentages of
total numbers of payments. As an example, imagine that the **Billing state**
graph shows 6% of fraudulent payment volume for Utah. That means the total
amount charged for fraudulent payments with Utah as the billing state is 6% of
the total amount charged for all fraudulent payments. It doesn’t indicate that
6% of all fraudulent payment transactions had Utah as the billing state.

Hover over any point in the chart to see additional metrics for both fraudulent
and legitimate payments associated with that attribute value.
