When paying with PayTo, customers [authenticate and\napprove](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#customer-actions)\nagreements using their mobile banking app.\n\nYou get [delayed\nnotification](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#payment-notification)\non whether the payment succeeded or failed. Stripe typically sends a\nnotification of the final status of the payment within 30 seconds of the\nagreement authorization.\n\nPayment method propertiesCountry availability- **Customer locations**\n\nAustralia\n- **Presentment currency**\n\nAUD\n- **Payment confirmation**\n\nCustomer-initiated\n- **Payment method family**\n\nReal-time payments\n- **Recurring payments**\n\nYes\n- **Payout timing**\n\n[Standard payout timing](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts#payout-speed) applies\n- **Connect support**\n\nYes\n- **Dispute support**\n\nNo\n- **Manual capture support**\n\nNo\n- **Refunds and partial refunds**\n\nYes, yes\n\n## Interested in getting early access to PayTo?\n\nTo learn more or get early access, enter your email address below. We’ll work\nwith you to determine your eligibility, and from there, add you to the waitlist.\n\nCollect EmailSign upRead our [privacy policy](https://stripe.com/privacy).\n## Payment flows\n\nCustomers pay with PayTo by using one of the following methods:\n\n- **PayID**: Customers can provide a PayID, a unique identifier linked to a\ncustomer’s bank account, to initiate agreement authorization.\n- **Account and BSB Numbers**: Customers can provide their bank account details\nto initiate agreement authorization.\n\nIn both cases, customers receive a request from their bank to authorize the\nPayTo agreement. This request typically surfaces through a push notification or\nby email.\n\n## Get started\n\nPayTo is only available on the [Payment\nElement](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payto/accept-a-payment?ui=elements) or\nthrough a [direct API\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payto/accept-a-payment?ui=direct-api).\nIt isn’t available in any other Stripe-hosted UIs. PayTo is available as a\n[Dynamic payment\nmethod](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/dynamic-payment-methods),\nwhich means you don’t have to individually integrate PayTo and other payment\nmethods. If you use the Payment Element, Stripe automatically determines the\nmost relevant payment methods to display. Go to the [Stripe\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and enable\nPayTo.\n\nIf you prefer to manually list payment methods, learn how to [manually\nconfigure](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payto/accept-a-payment) PayTo as a\npayment.\n\n## Refunds\n\nRefund PayTo payments by calling the [Stripe Refunds\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api/refunds) or using the Dashboard. You can refund\na PayTo payment up to 2 years after the original payment. Customers typically\nreceive refunds in their bank accounts within 2 days, but some banks might take\nup to 10 days to process a PayTo refund.\n\nPayTo supports full and partial refunds. You can also issue multiple partial\nrefunds up to the amount of the original charge.\n\nFor PayTo payments made using PayID, Stripe sends an email to the customer to\ncollect their bank account details before processing the refund.\n\n## Connect\n\nYou can use [Stripe Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/how-connect-works)\nwith PayTo to process payments on behalf of a connected account. Connect users\ncan use PayTo with the following charge types:\n\n- [Direct](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges)\n- [Destination](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges)\n- [Separate charges and\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n### Enable PayTo for connected accounts that use the Stripe Dashboard\n\nReach out to your Stripe representative to enable PayTo for connected accounts\nthat use the Stripe Dashboard or [email us](mailto:payto-support@stripe.com).\nThese connect accounts must onboard manually.\n\n### Enable PayTo for connected accounts that use the Express Dashboard or a dashboard that isn’t hosted by Stripe\n\nTo onboard connected accounts that use the Express Dashboard or a dashboard that\nisn’t hosted by Stripe, request the `payto_payments` capability using the\n[Capabilities API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/capabilities). For more details,\nfollow the instructions to [enable payment methods for your connected\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities).\n\n## Transaction limits and other considerations\n\nAcross the banks, PayTo performs best for recurring transactions, and\ntransactions below 1,000 AUD. PayTo performance might vary depending on the\nbuyer’s bank, their account type, and the frequency of payments. Each bank can\nenforce additional measures to manage risk and prevent fraud.\n\nSee the documentation linked below for more details on bank-specific\nconsiderations.\n\nBank nameAdditional notes[ANZ (Australia and New Zealand Banking\nGroup)](https://www.anz.com.au/personal/ways-to-bank/more/pay-to)Payments over\n25,000 AUD are not accepted by ANZ.[CBA (Commonwealth Bank of\nAustralia)](https://www.commbank.com.au/digital-banking/pay-to.html)[NAB\n(National Australia\nBank)](https://www.nab.com.au/personal/online-banking/digital-payments/payto)[Westpac](https://www.westpac.com.au/personal-banking/mobile-wallets/payto)Payments\nover 25,000 AUD are not accepted by Westpac.
