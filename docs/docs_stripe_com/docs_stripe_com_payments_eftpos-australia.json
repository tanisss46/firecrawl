More than 90% of eftpos cards are co-branded with either Visa or\nMastercard, meaning you can process these cards over either network supported by\nthe card.\n\nStripe processes co-branded eftpos cards over eftpos, plus either Visa or\nMastercard, in accordance with [least cost routing\nrequirements](https://support.stripe.com/questions/supporting-dual-network-debit-cards-in-australia)\nand depending on the [type of\ntransaction](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/eftpos-australia#identify-which-network-a-payment-was-processed-on).\n\n#### Note\n\nEftpos-only cards (also known as “proprietary eftpos cards”) only support\nin-person payments and can’t be used for online transactions.\n\nPayment method propertiesBusiness locationsProduct support- **Customer\nlocations**\n\nAustralia\n- **Presentment currency**\n\nAUD\n- **Payment confirmation**\n\nCustomer-initiated\n- **Payment method family**\n\nCards\n- **Payment method type**\n\nDebit and prepaid cards\n- **Recurring payments**\n\nYes\n- **Payout timing**\n\nStandard payout timing applies\n- **Connect support**\n\nYes\n- **Dispute support**\n\nYes\n- **Manual capture support**\n\nNo\n- **Refunds / Partial refunds**\n\nYes / Yes\n\n## Availability\n\nEftpos is available to any business that uses Stripe in Australia, with the\nfollowing exceptions:\n\n- Massage parlors ([MCC](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/setting-mcc) 7297)\n- Financial institutions—manual cash disbursements\n([MCC](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/setting-mcc) 6010)\n- Financial institutions—merchandise and services\n([MCC](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/setting-mcc) 6012)\n- Non-financial institutions—foreign currency, money orders and travelers’\nchecks.

Unless you change the default\nnetwork, you must inform your customers that whenever they use a dual-network\ndebit card, their payments might be processed through the debit network,\nregardless of the logo that appears when they enter their payment information.\n\nWe recommend you notify your customers based on the type of payment transaction:\n\n- For single payment transactions, display a notification to the customer before\nthe completion of the checkout process.\n- For new recurring payment transactions, display a notification to the customer\nat the time of setup.\n- For existing recurring payment transactions, notify your customers in advance\nof future transactions.\n\nYou must notify your customers about how network routing functions, and how\npayments processing works. You can use the suggested notification message below:\n\n#### Note\n\nNotwithstanding the payment brand logo displayed when you enter your payment\ninformation, whenever you use a dual-network debit card displaying eftpos and\nanother payment brand, your payment (including any future recurring debit\npayments authorized by you) might be processed through either network. See the\n[Terms and Conditions] or [FAQs] for more information.\n\nWe recommend that you provide further information in your Terms and Conditions\nor FAQs on how network routing functions and how payments processing works. For\nguidelines on best practices, see the Australian Payments Network [MCR Online\nNotification\nGuidelines](https://www.auspaynet.com.au/resources/cards-and-devices).\n\n## Understand which network processes payments\n\nStripe dynamically routes between the international scheme (Visa or Mastercard)\nand eftpos, depending on the type of payment, technical availability and\nauthorization rate considerations:\n\n- If a payment requires [placing a hold on the\ncard](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/place-a-hold-on-a-payment-method) (in\nother words, if there’s a delay between authorization and capture), or if it\nrequires [3D Secure](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure), Stripe always\nroutes to the international scheme.\n- For other types of payments, Stripe generally defaults to the eftpos network.\n\nIf you require that eftpos is never the default network for any payments, please\ncontact [support](https://support.stripe.com/contact).\n\nTo identify which network a payment was processed on, inspect the\n[network](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-payment_method_details-card-network)\nfield on the [Charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object) object\nassociated with a successful [Payment\nIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object):\n\n```\n{\n \"id\": \"ch_1Ff52K2eZvKYlo2CWe10i0s7\",\n \"object\": \"charge\",\n ...\n \"payment_method_details\": {\n \"card\": {\n \"brand\": \"visa\",\n ...\n \"network\": \"eftpos_au\"\n },\n \"type\": \"card\"\n }\n}\n```\n\n## See also\n\n- [Migrating from Charges API to the Payment Intents\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents/migration)\n- [Available eftpos test cards](https://docs.stripe.com/testing#cards)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Eftpos](https://www.eftposaustralia.com.au/)\n- [least cost routing\nrequirements](https://support.stripe.com/questions/supporting-dual-network-debit-cards-in-australia)\n- [type of\ntransaction](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/eftpos-australia#identify-which-network-a-payment-was-processed-on)\n- [MCC](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/setting-mcc)\n- [accept card payments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment)\n- [MCR Online Notification\nGuidelines](https://www.auspaynet.com.au/resources/cards-and-devices)\n- [placing a hold on the\ncard](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/place-a-hold-on-a-payment-method)\n- [3D Secure](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure)\n- [support](https://support.stripe.com/contact)\n-\n[network](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-payment_method_details-card-network)\n- [Charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object)\n- [Payment Intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object)\n- [Migrating from Charges API to the Payment Intents\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents/migration)\n- [Available eftpos test cards](https://docs.stripe.com/testing#cards)",
