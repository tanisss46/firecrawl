# Collect tax in Kentucky

## Learn how to use Stripe Tax to calculate, collect, and report tax in Kentucky.

In Kentucky, Stripe Tax supports calculation and collection of [sales
tax](https://revenue.ky.gov/Business/Sales-Use-Tax/Pages/default.aspx).

## When to register for tax collection

See [Thresholds](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/thresholds) to get insights
about your potential tax registration obligations in Kentucky. Stripe also
notifies you with email and Dashboard alerts when you need to register to
collect tax. Learn more about how the [monitoring tool
works](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/monitoring).

### Sales tax

Remote sellers must register to collect and remit tax in Kentucky when, previous
or current calendar year, they do one of the following:

- Exceed a sales threshold of 100,000 USD
- Meet or exceed a volume threshold of 200 transactions

The thresholds include sales of tangible personal property and digital property,
whether taxable or nontaxable, including wholesale sales (sales for resale) and
marketplace sales. The thresholds exclude sales of services.

### Other taxes

We also support:

- [Kentucky State and Local Communications
Tax](https://revenue.ky.gov/Business/Telecommunications-Tax/Pages/default.aspx)—for
businesses selling video streaming to customers in Kentucky. This includes the
Multi Channel Video Programming Excise Tax and Utility Gross Receipts License
Tax. These taxes only apply when your business has physical presence in
Kentucky. This means there isn’t a revenue threshold for when remote sellers
need to pay this tax. Transactions for these taxes aren’t included in Stripe
monitoring for Kentucky. The linked page is only accessible within the US or via
a VPN.

After you’ve registered to collect tax in Kentucky, go to

Learn [how to add your
registration](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/registering#track-your-registrations-in-the-tax-dashboard)
in the Dashboard.

## How we calculate taxes

Stripe calculates the taxes that apply to your customer’s location.

## Report and file your taxes

Stripe provides reports of your completed tax transactions. Go to
[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations) to access these
reports.

### Exports

The tax transaction data export provides a comprehensive and aggregated view of
transactions by location, including a breakdown of individual tax amounts. Learn
more about [tax reporting exports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports#exports).

### Location reports

[Location reports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports#us-location-reports)
offer a summary of transaction and refund data for specific US locations and
align with Kentucky filing requirements. You have the option to report on an
annual, fiscal year, quarterly, or monthly basis.

Reporting-specific considerations:

- The location reports don’t include transactions with the Kentucky State and
Local Communications Tax as these are filed to the state using a different
report. To see transactions with these taxes, you can use the
[exports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports#exports).

### Filing

Stripe Tax has filing partners—Taxually, Marosa, and Hands-off Sales Tax
(HOST)—to help automate your tax filing. These partners automatically sync your
tax transaction data in real time, eliminating the need for manual data entry or
file transfers. Learn more about [tax
filing](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/filing).
