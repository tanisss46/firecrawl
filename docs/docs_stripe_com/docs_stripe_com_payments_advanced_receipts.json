Learn more about\n[receipts for payments](https://docs.stripe.com/receipts).\n\n## Automatically send receipts\n\nTo enable automated receipts, toggle **Successful payments** on in your\n[Customer emails settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/emails).\nReceipts are only sent when a successful payment has been made. No receipt is\nsent if the payment fails or is declined.\n\nYou don’t have to specify any receipt parameters when you create a\n[PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents). However, if\nyou specify a\n[receipt_email](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-receipt_email)\nand the payment succeeds, Stripe sends a receipt to that address regardless of\nyour Customer emails settings.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d amount=1099 \\\n -d currency=usd \\\n -d \"payment_method_types[]\"=card \\\n --data-urlencode description=\"Thanks for your purchase!\" \\\n--data-urlencode\nreceipt_email=\"I.override.your.customer.email.settings@example.com\"\n```\n\nThe receipt displays the amount, your [public business\ninformation](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public), and any value in the\n`description` parameter of the request. Receipts for one-time payments include\nonly this information. You can’t add additional line items.\n\nTo trigger an automatic receipt after the payment is complete, update the\nPaymentIntent’s\n[receipt_email](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/confirm#confirm_payment_intent-receipt_email).\n\n## Customize receipts\n\nAlter the appearance and functionality of your receipts with the following\ncustomization options:\n\n- **Branding**: Modify the logo and colors in your [Branding\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding). The upper limit for a\ncustom logo image file size is 512KB. Ideally, the logo should be a square image\nexceeding 128 x 128 pixels. JPG, PNG, and GIF file types are supported.\n- **Public information**: Specify the public information you want to include,\nsuch as your contact number or website address, in your [Public details\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public).\n\nTo display custom text, use the\n[description](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-description)\nattribute on the\n[PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object). Some\nexamples include:\n\n- Description of goods or services provided\n- Authorization code\n- Subscription information\n- Cancellation policies\n\nYou can see a real-time preview of your email receipt on your Dashboard Branding\nsettings page. To send a test receipt, hover over the preview image and click\n**Send test receipt**, then enter your email address.\n\n#### Caution\n\nReceipts pull data from the `Charge` object generated when the PaymentIntent is\nconfirmed. To update receipt data such as the `description` after the charge is\ngenerated, you must [update the\nCharge](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/update). Changes to a confirmed\nPaymentIntent don’t appear on receipts.\n\n## Automatically send paid invoices\n\nThe [Payment Intents API](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents)\ncan’t generate invoices. Use Stripe Billing to directly [create the\ninvoice](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/quickstart).\n\n## Localization\n\nWhen using the Payment Intents API, the language of the receipt is determined by\nseveral factors:\n\n- If a Customer is set, their [preferred\nlocale](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-preferred_locales)\nis used if available.\n- If a Customer is set without any preferred locale, or if no Customer is set,\nthe [language setting](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/emails) from the\nStripe Dashboard is applied.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements)\n- [Payment Intents API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents)\n- [receipts for payments](https://docs.stripe.com/receipts)\n- [Customer emails settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/emails)\n- [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents)\n-\n[receipt_email](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-receipt_email)\n- [public business information](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public)\n-\n[receipt_email](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/confirm#confirm_payment_intent-receipt_email)\n- [Branding settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding)\n-\n[description](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-description)\n- [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object)\n- [update the Charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/update)\n- [create the invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/quickstart)\n- [preferred\nlocale](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-preferred_locales)",
