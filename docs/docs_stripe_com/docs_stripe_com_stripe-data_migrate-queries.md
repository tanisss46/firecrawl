# Migrate queries

## Migrate your Sigma queries from Presto to Trino.

We upgraded Sigma’s query infrastructure from [Presto
v334](https://trino.io/docs/334/sql.html) to [Trino
v414](https://trino.io/docs/414/sql/select.html). Most queries run faster as a
result of the upgrade, but a few queries might error unexpectedly or produce
results in different formats.

Use the following suggestions to make your Sigma queries compatible with Trino
v414.

## Invalid time zones

The `AMERICA/NEW_YORK` time zone is no longer valid in Trino v414.

```
-- FAILED: Presto error: NOT_SUPPORTED: Time zone not supported:
AMERICA/NEW_YORK
select
 date_format(
 c.created AT TIME ZONE 'AMERICA/NEW_YORK',
 '%Y-%m-%d'
 )
from
 charges c
```

Instead, use `America/New_York`.

```
-- VALID
select
 date_format(
 c.created AT TIME ZONE 'America/New_York',
 '%Y-%m-%d'
 )
from
 charges c
```

## Invalid column references

Trino v414 doesn’t allow referencing column names with their originating
sub-query or conditional table expression (CTE) out of scope.

```
-- FAILED: Presto error: COLUMN_NOT_FOUND: Column 'c.created' cannot be resolved
select c.created from (select created from charges c)
```

The previous query is invalid because the sub-query `c` isn’t defined at the top
level but is referenced at the top level, out of its defined scope.

```
-- VALID
select created from (select created from charges c)
```

```
-- VALID
select c.created from (select created from charges) c
```

Either reference the column without the sub-query or define the sub-query at the
same level as its reference.

## Scientific notation

Casting a [double](https://trino.io/docs/414/language/types.html#double) to a
[varchar](https://trino.io/docs/414/language/types.html#string) in Trino v414
produces results in scientific notation instead of decimal notation as in Presto
v334.

```
-- RESULT: 1.0E2
select cast(100.0 as varchar)
```

To maintain this decimal notation, cast the double as a
[decimal](https://trino.io/docs/414/language/types.html#decimal) and then as a
varchar.

```
-- RESULT: 100.0
select cast(cast(100.0 as decimal(18,1)) as varchar)
```

## Timestamp functions

### FROM_UNIXTIME

Trino v414 assumes that the result timestamp is in UTC and adds a trailing “UTC”
when using
[from_unixtime](https://trino.io/docs/414/functions/datetime.html?highlight=from_unixtime#from_unixtime).

```
-- Trino v414 RESULT: 1970-01-01 00:00:00.000 UTC
-- Presto v334 RESULT: 1970-01-01 00:00:00 +0000
select from_unixtime(0)
```

To remove the trailing “UTC”, cast the result of `from_unixtime` as `timestamp`.

```
-- RESULT: 1970-01-01 00:00:00 +0000
select cast(from_unixtime(0) as timestamp)
```

### TO_ISO8601

In Presto v334,
[to_iso8601](https://trino.io/docs/414/functions/datetime.html?highlight=to_iso8601#to_iso8601)
adds a trailing Zulu time zone suffix (“Z”) to a timestamp without a time zone
while Trino v414 doesn’t.

```
-- Presto v334 RESULT: 2024-04-01T00:00:00.000Z
-- Trino v414 RESULT: 2024-04-01T00:00:00
select to_iso8601(timestamp '2024-04-01')
```

To make sure the trailing Zulu time zone suffix is added, interpret the
timestamp in UTC before calling `to_iso8601`.

```
-- RESULT: 2024-04-01T00:00:00Z
select to_iso8601(timestamp '2024-04-01' at time zone 'UTC')
```

## Query non-determinism

If you query is non-deterministic, regardless of the Sigma version, different
executions can yield different results. Here are common query patterns that can
lead to non-deterministic results.

### Top K queries

```
-- POTENTIALLY NON-DETERMINISTIC
select * from charges order by created DESC limit 10
```

If the 10th and 11th latest created charges were created at the same time,
there’s no guarantee which charge is returned. Make sure to also sort on a
unique identifier for deterministic results.

```
-- DETERMINISTIC
select * from charges order by created DESC, id limit 10
```

### Window aggregation

```
-- POTENTIALLY NON-DETERMINISTIC
select
 *
from
 (
 select
 c.*,
 row_number() over (
 partition by c.customer_id
 order by
 c.amount DESC
 ) as row_rank
 from
 charges c
 )
where
 row_rank = 1
```

The above query returns the biggest charge for each customer using
[row_number](https://trino.io/docs/414/functions/window.html?highlight=row_number#row_number).
See [window functions](https://trino.io/docs/414/functions/window.html). If a
customer has multiple charges with the same maximum amount, there’s no guarantee
which charge is returned.

Sort on a unique identifier in the window ordering for deterministic results.

```
-- DETERMINISTIC
select
 *
from
 (
 select
 c.*,
 row_number() over (
 partition by c.customer_id
 order by
 c.amount DESC, c.created DESC, c.id
 ) as row_rank
 from
 charges c
 )
where
 row_rank = 1
```
