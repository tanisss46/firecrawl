# Activate your account

## Learn how to activate and secure your Stripe account.

You can begin using your Stripe account in [test
mode](https://docs.stripe.com/test-mode) as soon as you create it. In test mode,
you can simulate all of Stripe’s features without moving real money. To accept
real payments, you need to first activate your account and then use live mode.
If you haven’t [created your Stripe
account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register) yet, complete that process
before continuing.

## Activate your account

To activate your account, fill out the [account
application](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/onboarding) requesting some
basic information about your business, product, and your personal relationship
to your business. After activating your account, you can immediately start
accepting live payments.

Stripe’s “Know Your Customer” (KYC) obligations require that we collect and
maintain this information on all Stripe users. These requirements come from our
regulators and financial partners, and are intended to prevent abuse of the
financial system. We review the information you provide internally to make sure
that it complies with [our services agreement](https://stripe.com/legal). We’ll
contact you if we need any further information.

After you activate your Stripe account, you can’t change its country. If you
need to use Stripe in a different country that we support, you must create a new
account.

#### Caution

We take privacy and security very seriously. Our [privacy
policy](https://stripe.com/privacy) explains how and for what purposes we
collect, use, retain, disclose, and safeguard any personal data you provide to
us.

## Public business information

Your customers see the following details on either their card statements or in
[email receipts](https://docs.stripe.com/receipts) sent by Stripe.

- Business name and website URL
- Business email address, phone number, and address
- Support site URL
- Statement descriptor text

You provide this information when you activate your account, and can update it
any time in your [Account
settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public). Make sure that your
statement descriptor text and business information are clearly associated with
you. If your customer can’t recognize one of your payments, they might
[dispute](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes) it.

Statement descriptors are limited to between 5 and 22 characters. They must
contain at least 5 letters and can’t use the special characters `<`, `>`, `\`,
`'`, `"`, or `*`.

You can also use dynamic statement descriptors when creating a charge so that
each payment has a custom statement descriptor. This dynamic text is appended to
the [shortened descriptor](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public) set in
the Stripe Dashboard. Statement descriptor prefixes are limited to between 2 and
10 characters. For detailed information, see the documentation on [statement
descriptors](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/statement-descriptors).

## Keep your account safe

After you set up your account, you’ll want to keep it safe. Here are our
recommendations:

- **Keep private information private**: Don’t share your password and keep your
secret [API keys](https://docs.stripe.com/keys) confidential on your own
servers. As a reminder, Stripe employees will never ask you for your keys.
- **Don’t reuse your Stripe password**: Use a password that’s unique to Stripe.
If you use your password on another site and that site is compromised, an
attacker could use those stolen credentials to take over your account.
- **Use team members to provide others with access to your account**: You can
[invite others](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/teams) (with limited
access) to your Stripe account so that they can log in and take certain actions.
- **Update your computer and browser regularly**: We recommend configuring your
computer to automatically download and install updates (for example,
[macOS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201541) or
[Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/306525)). This helps protect
your system against automated attacks and malware.
- **Beware of phishing**: All [genuine Stripe
sites](https://support.stripe.com/questions/verify-you-are-on-an-official-stripe-webpage)
use the `stripe.com` domain and HTTPS. If you get an email from us that you
don’t expect, go directly to our site to log in. Don’t enter your password after
clicking a link in an email. If you’re ever not sure it’s really us, review
[Verified Stripe
domains](https://support.stripe.com/questions/verified-stripe-domains) on Stripe
Support.
- **Enable two-factor verification**: When you enable two-factor authentication,
you’ll need to provide an additional unique code from your mobile device to
complete the login process—either received as a text message or generated
through an app like Google Authenticator. This means that even if someone steals
your username and password, they won’t be able to log in. To enable this
feature, go to your [user settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/user).
