# Stripe CLI keys and permissions

## Learn about default Stripe CLI keys generated when you run "stripe login" and their permissions.

By default, you can use your accountâ€™s *secret keys* to perform any API request
without restriction. When you run the `stripe login` command to authenticate to
the Stripe CLI, the CLI generates a set of *restricted keys* for your account
(one for a sandbox, one in live mode) that are valid for 90 days.

## About restricted keys

Unlike an API secret key, a *restricted* key generated by the Stripe CLI has
restrictions on the API requests that it can perform. You can create new
restricted keys in the Dashboard with different restrictions, or specify any API
key using the `--api-key` flag.

### Where keys are stored

The CLI stores the keys in the **Restricted keys** section on the [API
Keys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys) page and your local machine in
`~/.config/stripe/config.toml`.

### Where to find permissions

Use these steps to view the permissions associated with your restricted key:

- Open the [API keys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys) page.
- Scroll down to the **Restricted keys** section.
- Hover over the *info* () icon next to your **CLI key** name to view
permissions.

## Specify an API key

- Use the `--api-key` flag to specify your API secret key inline each time you
send a request.

```
stripe login --api-key sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2
```
