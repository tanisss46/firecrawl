With a dedicated user, you can also identify actions taken or\nchanges made by that user in the NetSuite system log.\n\nIf you can’t provide a dedicated user, you can provide a shared user that isn’t\nused for other integrations. Any changes to that user can negatively impact the\nconnector. For example, if you use an existing user login and that employee\nleaves the company, deleting their NetSuite user can break the connector and\nstop record syncing.\n\n## Prepare to grant admin access\n\nThe implementation partner requires temporary admin access during onboarding for\nthe following:\n\n- Testing in the sandbox environment\n- Implementing the connector live in production\n- Troubleshooting issues specific to your NetSuite account\n\nIf you must restrict access, we recommend providing admin and GUI access in the\nsandbox environment, and then removing permissions before you move to\nproduction.\n\nYour implementation partner can provide further instructions for granting\naccess.\n\n## (Optional) Set up Stripe Billing\n\nIf you use Stripe Billing and have existing Stripe prices and NetSuite items,\nyou need to do the following to prepare for onboarding:\n\n- Prepare a data sheet to map IDs for existing Stripe and NetSuite customers.\n- Prepare a data sheet to map IDs for existing Stripe prices and NetSuite items.\n- Determine the rule for the connector to use for NetSuite revenue recognition.\n- Determine the start date to sync records.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Install the app](https://marketplace.stripe.com/apps/netsuite-connector)\n- [Activate your Stripe\naccount](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/netsuite/onboarding#stripe-account)\n- [Set up a NetSuite test\naccount](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/netsuite/onboarding#netsuite-sandbox)\n- [Create a dedicated NetSuite user to operate the\nconnector](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/netsuite/onboarding#netsuite-user)\n- [Provide temporary admin access for the implementation\npartner](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/netsuite/onboarding#admin-access)\n- [Set up Stripe\nBilling](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/netsuite/onboarding#stripe-billing)\n- [activate your Stripe\naccount](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/activate)",
