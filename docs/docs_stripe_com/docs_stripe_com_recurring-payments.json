Use\nSubscriptions with Stripe Billing, PaymentIntents, SetupIntents, or Invoicing.\n\n### Use subscriptions to accept recurring payments\n\n### Save and reuse payment information for recurring charges\n\n### Use invoices to automatically charge customers\n\n## Split purchases into a few payments\n\nOffer your customers payment plans in installments with [Subscription Schedules\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscription_schedules) (part of Stripe\nBilling) or buy now, pay later methods. If your business is based in Mexico, you\ncan offer card payments in installments.\n\n### Create an installment plan with Subscription Schedules\n\n### Use a buy now, pay later payment method\n\n### Accept card payments in installments\n\n## Enable customers to manage their own subscriptions\n\nIf you want your customers to manage their own accounts and recurring\nsubscriptions, use the customer portal. Stripe hosts the customer portal, which\nallows your customers to self-manage their payment details, download invoices,\nand manage their subscriptions in one place. Read the [no-code customer portal\nguide](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management/activate-no-code-customer-portal)\nfor complete details.\n\n[Integrate with the customer portal\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management/integrate-customer-portal)\n\n### Set up the customer portal\n\nSee what your customers can do in the customer portal\n\n[View demo](https://billing.stripe.com/customer-portal-demo)\n\n## Accept recurring donations\n\nYou can accept recurring donations with Stripe, in the same way as recurring\npayments. For example, you have a llama rescue organization, Llama House, and\nwant to allow supporters to choose an amount for a recurring, monthly donation.\nYou can use Payment Links to create a link to share on social media and email.\nFrom the same payment link, you can also generate a QR code to add to flyers,\nand an embeddable buy button for your website–all from the Dashboard.\n\n### Accept recurring donations with Payment Links\n\n## Migrate existing subscriptions to Stripe\n\nIf you have existing subscriptions in another system, you can migrate them to\nStripe Billing.
