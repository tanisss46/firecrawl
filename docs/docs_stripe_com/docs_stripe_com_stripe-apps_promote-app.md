# Promote your app

## Learn how to partner with Stripe to help accelerate the growth of your app.

## Join the Stripe Partner Ecosystem

Join a global community of partners that helps ambitious businesses with
industry-leading payments and financial infrastructure.

When you publish apps to the Stripe App Marketplace, you are invited to join the
Stripe Partner Ecosystem’s Apps track. As part of the ecosystem, partners can
co-market with Stripe, engage and influence Stripe Apps roadmap, and build their
network. Partners in the Apps track also receive tools and resources to grow
their business with Stripe, and drive customer acquisition opportunities, such
as:

- Access to marketing with Stripe, including our [campaigns-in-a-box and product
toolkit](https://docs.stripe.com/partners#marketing-content).
- Eligibility for [Market Development Funds
(MDF)](https://docs.stripe.com/partners#market-development-funds) to reimburse
you for the cost of co-marketing activities, such as partner-led campaigns and
customer-facing events
- Access to co-selling with Stripe by leveraging the [Crossbeam
platform](https://docs.stripe.com/partners#crossbeam-account-mapping) and
discovering overlapping customers and prospects in an automated and secure
manner
- A [partner directory](https://stripe.com/partners) listing, making your app
more searchable for Stripe customers

There are four tracks of the Stripe Partner Ecosystem:
[Apps](https://docs.stripe.com/partners#apps-track), [embedded
payments](https://docs.stripe.com/partners#embedded-payments),
[services](https://docs.stripe.com/partners#services-track), and
[technology](https://docs.stripe.com/partners#technology-track). Partners have
the flexibility to choose one or multiple tracks with benefits aligned to your
business goals. [Read more](https://docs.stripe.com/partners) about the benefits
of joining the Stripe Partner Ecosystem for partners on the Apps track.

After passing the app review, you’ll receive an invite to join the Apps track.
Simply [apply](https://stripe.com/partners/become-a-partner), and complete your
profile in the partner portal to gain access to tools that can help you grow
your business.

## Best practices using Stripe branding guidelines

Use Stripe pre-approved promotional asset templates and [branding
guidelines](https://portal.stripe.partners/s/article/Co-branding-Guidelines) to
promote your app.

When you’re ready to publish your app on the Stripe App Marketplace, you can
promote your app. Stripe provides branding guidelines, pre-approved promotional
asset templates, and additional recommendations to help you with app promotion.

## Branding guidelines

To view a complete set of design resources, open the [Figma library for Stripe
Apps](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1105918844720321397), then navigate
to **Pages** > **Marketplace assets** in the left panel. The Figma library
includes templates and applicable guidelines to create your app icon, promotion
assets for social media, and the Stripe App Marketplace badge.

#### Caution

If you use the Stripe App Marketplace badge, you must adhere to our [Marks Usage
Guidelines](https://stripe.com/legal/marks).
