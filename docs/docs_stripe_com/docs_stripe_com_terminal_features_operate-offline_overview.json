When a\nnetwork connection is restored, the SDK automatically forwards any stored\npayments to Stripe.\n\nFrom your application’s perspective, the payment collection process is similar\nto operating online. While offline, the SDK securely stores the payment\ninformation and automatically forwards the stored payments when connectivity is\nrestored. The SDK allows you to handle offline-related events using callbacks to\nyour application.\n\n## Availability\n\n**Payment methods**: Visa, Mastercard, Discover, and American Express.\n\nCustomers can present a card or NFC-based mobile wallet belonging to a supported\ncard brand. Swiping cards isn’t allowed. If you’re collecting payments in the\n[European Economic Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Area),\ncustomers are required to insert their card and enter a PIN.\n\nInterac, eftpos, and girocard aren’t supported. Co-branded eftpos cards are\nrouted through the international scheme instead. For more information, see\n[eftpos Australia](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/eftpos-australia).\n\n**Readers**: [BBPOS Chipper 2X\nBT](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/readers/bbpos-chipper2xbt), [Stripe Reader\nM2](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/readers/stripe-m2), [BBPOS WisePad\n3](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/readers/bbpos-wisepad3)\n\n**Connection type**: Bluetooth, USB (Android only)\n\n**Integration types**: iOS SDK, Android SDK, React Native SDK\n\n### Collect a payment while offline\n\nThe following diagram describes the payment collection process when the Terminal\nSDK is offline. When storing payments, the SDK stores the payments to disk. You\ncan safely reboot the POS device even if it has stored offline payments. When\nyou re-initialize the SDK and it has reestablished a connection to the internet,\nand the SDK resumes forwarding any remaining stored payments.\n\nPOS application\n\nTerminal SDK\n\nMobile reader\n\nCreate PaymentIntent\n\nSecurely store request information\n\nSuccess callback\n\nCollect payment method\n\nPrompt for payment method\n\nPayment method data\n\nSuccess callback\n\nConfirm PaymentIntent\n\nSecurely store request information\n\nSuccess callback\n\nA high-level diagram that shows how offline payments are stored.\n### Forward stored payments when online\n\nThe following diagram describes how stored payments are forwarded after\nconnectivity is restored.\n\nYour backend\n\nPOS application\n\nTerminal SDK\n\nStripe backend\n\nFetch connection token\n\nFetch connection token\n\nPOST /v1/terminal/connection_tokens\n\nConnection token\n\nConnection token\n\nConnection token\n\nAuthenticate using connection token\n\nAuthentication token\n\nForward stored payment\n\nSuccess or decline response\n\nForwarding event notification\n\nA high-level diagram that shows how offline payments are forwarded to the Stripe\nbackend.\n## See also\n\n- [Collect card payments while\noffline](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/operate-offline/collect-card-payments)\n\n## Links\n\n- [European Economic Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Area)\n- [eftpos Australia](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/eftpos-australia)\n- [BBPOS Chipper 2X\nBT](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/readers/bbpos-chipper2xbt)\n- [Stripe Reader M2](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/readers/stripe-m2)\n- [BBPOS WisePad 3](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/readers/bbpos-wisepad3)\n- [Collect card payments while\noffline](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/operate-offline/collect-card-payments)",
