For example, when a payout reversal is first requested, a\n`payout.updated` event is sent for the original payout. Then, events for the\npayout reversal are sent, including `payout.created`, `payout.updated`,\n`payout.paid`, and possibly a `payout.failed` event.\n\n## Failures\n\nIf the original payout fails while the payout reversal is in a `pending` state,\nStripe cancels the reversing payout. A payout reversal in the `paid` state can\nlater be refused by the associated bank and transition to the `failed` state.\nThis results in a `payout.failed` event. Failed payout reversals aren’t retried.\n\n## Links\n\n- [payout](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts)\n- [reverse payout](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payouts/reverse)\n- [Instant Payout](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/instant-payouts)",
