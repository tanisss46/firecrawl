# Scheduled payments

## Let your customers schedule their payments through the Hosted Invoice Page.

Stripe offers flexibility by enabling your customers to schedule payments for a
future date through the [Hosted Invoice
Page](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/hosted-invoice-page). The scheduled
payments feature lets your customers take action immediately so that they won’t
forget to pay. Your customers can also go back to the Hosted Invoice Page at any
time and update their payment method and or scheduled date.

#### Note

The scheduled payments feature is currently only available in the US.

## Get started

From the [Invoice
template](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/invoice), you can enable
or disable scheduled payments for all invoices, including those that are
outstanding. You can’t leverage the Stripe API to toggle the scheduled payments
feature, or receive webhooks when an end merchant schedules a payment.

Turn on the scheduled payments feature for your customers

If your customer chooses to schedule their payment, the invoice appears on your
[Invoices page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/invoices) under **Scheduled**.
A badge also appears next to the invoice that indicates the invoice’s scheduled
status. Hovering over the badge tells you the invoice’s scheduled and estimated
delivery dates.

## End customer features

An end customer that receives a Stripe invoice and pays it through the Hosted
Invoice Page can:

- Choose whether to initiate payment now, or on a future date.
- See the invoice due date using the calendar popup.
- Know the estimated date a payment will reach your account.
- Be warned if the payment delivery is past the due date.
- Cancel or edit the scheduled payment before the due date.

#### Note

Your customers can still choose to schedule payments past the due date.

## Email notifications

Stripe sends email notifications to your customers when a payment has been
scheduled, and 3 days before the payment initiates (to make sure that they have
enough funds). Both emails contain a link to the Hosted Invoice Page for
reference.

#### Note

If a customer doesn’t have an associated email, they won’t receive payment
reminders.

After Stripe initiates the payment, the customer receives an email receipt. You
can also configure Stripe to send email notifications upon failed payment
attempts, or if your customer’s card on file is about to expire. To learn more,
see [Send email reminders](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/send-email).

## Limitations

Your customer faces certain limitations when they use the scheduled payments
feature.

### Collection method

- The scheduled payments feature is supported only when
[collection_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-collection_method)
is set to `send_invoice`.

### Payment methods

- Only credit cards are supported.
- Apple and Google Pay aren’t supported.
- International cards might be declined due to regulatory requirements for
step-up authentication (3DS). (We email the customer in these instances.)

### Invoice due dates

- The scheduled payments feature isn’t available if the invoice is due the same
day, next day, or is already past due.
- You can’t schedule a payment that’s 60 days or more out from the current date.
For example, you can’t schedule a payment for February 21, 2022, if the current
date is December 23, 2021.
