Customers typically pay by selecting their card issuer\nand authenticating through their card or bank’s app rather than manually\nentering their card details. Wallets are also becoming more popular in South\nKorea. To provide a familiar experience to customers and increase conversion\nrates, offer a selection of local wallets and cards.\n\n## Payment flow\n\nCustomers who pay with a local card are redirected to the local processor to\nselect their issuer. In this demo, the customer is paying with their Shinhan\ncard.\n\nAfter the customer enters their information in Stripe’s checkout page and clicks\n**Pay**, they’re redirected to the checkout page of the payment method provider\nor local processor to complete the payment.\n\n## Available payment methods\n\nYou can accept popular local wallets and all local cards.\n\nPopular local wallets include:\n\n- [Naver Pay](https://pay.naver.com/)\n- [Kakao Pay](https://www.kakaopay.com/)\n- [Samsung Pay](https://www.samsung.com/us/apps/samsung-wallet/)\n- [PAYCO](https://www.payco.com/)\n\nAll locally issued cards are supported, including:\n\n- [Shinhan Card](https://www.shinhancard.com/)\n- [Hyundai Card](https://www.hyundaicard.com/)\n- [Samsung\nCard](https://www.samsungcard.com/company/english/main/UHPPCI0245M0.jsp)\n\n#### Caution\n\nMake sure that in providing goods and services to South Korean customers, your\nbusiness complies with South Korean legal and tax requirements. Use Stripe Tax\nto [collect tax in South\nKorea](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/asia-pacific/south-korea).\n\nPayment method propertiesCountry availability- **Customer locations**\n\nSouth Korea\n- **Presentment currency**\n\nKRW\n- **Payment confirmation**\n\nCustomer-authenticated\n- **Payment method family**\n\nCountries\n- **Recurring payments**\n\nYes\n- **Payout timing**\n\n[T + 4 availability](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts#payout-speed)\n- **Connect support**\n\nYes\n- **Dispute support**\n\nYes\n- **Manual capture support**\n\nYes\n- **Refunds / Partial refunds**\n\nYes / Yes\n\n## Get started\n\nYou don’t have to integrate South Korean payment methods and other payment\nmethods individually. If you use our front-end products, Stripe automatically\ndetermines the most relevant payment methods to display. Go to the [Stripe\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and enable\nSouth Korean payment methods. To get started with one of our hosted UIs, follow\na quickstart:\n\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart): Our prebuilt, hosted\ncheckout page.\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart): Our drop-in UI\ncomponents.\n\n### Other payment products\n\nThe following Stripe products also let you add South Korean payment methods from\nthe Dashboard:\n\n- [Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/no-code-guide)\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n- [Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview)\n\n### Integrate through the API\n\nYou can also use the [Payment Intents\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents) to accept payments from\nSouth Korean customers using local cards and local payment methods. Follow our\nguide to [test your integration’s redirect-handling logic by simulating a\npayment that uses a redirect\nflow](https://docs.stripe.com/testing?testing-method=payment-methods#redirects).\n\n## Payment process\n\nCustomers who elect to pay with South Korean cards or payment methods are\nredirected to the local processor or underlying payment method provider’s\ncheckout page as applicable, where they [authorize the\ntransaction](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#customer-actions).\nAfter the payment is approved, funds are available in your Stripe account after\n4 days.\n\n## Payment methods\n\nWe currently support all local South Korean cards and the majority of South\nKorean payment methods.\n\nOne-timeRecurring[All local\ncards](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/kr-card/accept-a-payment)YesYes[Kakao\nPay](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/kakao-pay/accept-a-payment)YesYes[Naver\nPay](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/naver-pay/accept-a-payment)YesYes[Samsung\nPay](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/samsung-pay/accept-a-payment)[PAYCO](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payco/accept-a-payment)\n## Installments\n\nLocal card issuers in South Korea can offer installments on purchases 50,000 KRW\nand above. This lets customers pay for their purchase over time, for example, to\ncomplete the payment over 3 months. Installments are popular with customers who\nwant to purchase goods with higher order values.\n\nInstallments are solely between customers and their card issuers. As a business,\nyou receive the full amount for your purchase up front, and your customer is\nresponsible for completing the installment payments to the issuer. In the event\nthat your customer is unable to complete their installments to their issuer, you\nkeep the funds.\n\n## Refunds\n\nPayments made with South Korean payment methods can only be submitted for refund\nwithin 365 calendar days from the date of the original charge. After 365 days,\nit’s no longer possible to refund the charge.\n\n## Disputes\n\nLocal cards and payment methods in South Korea enforce strong authentication,\nwhich helps reduce the risk of fraud or unrecognized payments. Customers have up\nto 365 calendar days from the date of purchase to file a dispute. Stripe might\nrequest you to provide information and documentation in cases of customer\ndisputes. After a customer files a dispute, you have up to 5 days to submit\nevidence upon notification. Make sure you comply promptly with these requests.\nDispute decisions are made within 7 days of evidence submission. When using\nSouth Korean payment methods, you must make a reasonable effort to detect fraud\nor unauthorized transactions, and to minimize disputes.\n\n## Links\n\n- [pricing details](https://stripe.com/pricing/local-payment-methods)\n- [Naver Pay](https://pay.naver.com/)\n- [Kakao Pay](https://www.kakaopay.com/)\n- [Samsung Pay](https://www.samsung.com/us/apps/samsung-wallet/)\n- [PAYCO](https://www.payco.com/)\n- [Shinhan Card](https://www.shinhancard.com/)\n- [Hyundai Card](https://www.hyundaicard.com/)\n- [Samsung\nCard](https://www.samsungcard.com/company/english/main/UHPPCI0245M0.jsp)\n- [collect tax in South\nKorea](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/asia-pacific/south-korea)\n- [T + 4 availability](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts#payout-speed)\n- [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods)\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart)\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart)\n- [Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/no-code-guide)\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n- [Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview)\n- [Payment Intents API](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents)\n- [test your integration’s redirect-handling logic by simulating a payment that\nuses a redirect\nflow](https://docs.stripe.com/testing?testing-method=payment-methods#redirects)\n- [authorize the\ntransaction](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#customer-actions)\n- [All local cards](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/kr-card/accept-a-payment)\n- [Kakao Pay](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/kakao-pay/accept-a-payment)\n- [Naver Pay](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/naver-pay/accept-a-payment)\n- [Samsung Pay](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/samsung-pay/accept-a-payment)\n- [PAYCO](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payco/accept-a-payment)",
