When you file your 1099-NEC forms from\nthe [Tax forms view](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/taxes/forms) in the\nDashboard, Stripe submits your forms to the IRS and all qualifying states.\n\n### 1099-NEC FILING REQUIRED\n\nState PortalStripe submits the forms directly to these states. An additional\nstate filing fee of 1.49 USD applies per 1099-NEC form filed directly with state\nrevenue authorities.\nCFSF\n\nStates listed as CFSF are part of the Combined Federal / State Filing (CFSF)\nprogram. Forms filed to the IRS are automatically forwarded to the state,\neliminating separate reporting to the participating states. If forms have\nalready been filed with the IRS, you won’t be charged an additional state filing\nfee for filing in these states.\n\nSome states still require direct filing with the state, even though they\nparticipate in the CFSF program. Stripe submits the forms directly to these\nstates.\n\nIf State WithholdingYou’re required to file a 1099-NEC form with that state only\nif you withheld state taxes. In your Dashboard, you can specify the amount\nwithheld by updating the form and updating the `state_tax_withheld` column. When\nyou file your 1099-NEC forms in the Dashboard, we automatically export forms\neligible for state filing and with `state_tax_withheld` so you can file directly\nwith applicable states.\n#### Note\n\nSome forms that appear to be below the federal filing threshold can also appear\nas `Ready` or `Needs attention` due to Grouped TINs or state filing thresholds.\n[Learn\nmore](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/file-tax-forms#below-threshold-forms)\n\n### FILING DUE DATE\n\nWhile the IRS deadline to file 1099-NEC forms and deliver forms to your payees\nis January 31, we coupled filing and delivery together to streamline the\nprocess. **January 22, 2025** is the latest recommended date to file forms with\nthe IRS and states in your Stripe Dashboard. This guarantees forms are filed\nwith the IRS and a copy is sent to the recipients before the IRS delivery\ndeadline of January 31.\n\n### STATE NUMBERS\n\nSome states require State Tax Registration or Withholding IDs. Delaware and\nPennsylvania typically reject state filings for 1099-NEC, when state IDs are\nmissing and a state ID was issued. After you obtain the registration or\nwithholding ID, add the states in which you’ll file and the corresponding IDs on\nthe [Tax forms\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/tax_forms) page. In the\nDashboard, click **Settings**. On **Product settings**, under **Connect**, click\n**Tax form settings**. When filing forms in your Dashboard, you must provide an\nappropriate ID in states that require one.\n\n## See also\n\n- [File form with\nstates](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/tax-forms-state-requirements)\n- [Add the state tax Registration or withholding\nID](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/tax-forms-state-requirements#add-state-reg)\n\n## Links\n\n- [states you can file\ndirectly](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/tax-forms-state-requirements)\n- [Tax forms view](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/taxes/forms)\n- [Learn\nmore](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/file-tax-forms#below-threshold-forms)\n- [Tax forms settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/tax_forms)\n- [Add the state tax Registration or withholding\nID](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/tax-forms-state-requirements#add-state-reg)",
