In the US, businesses deal with [sales\ntax](https://stripe.com/guides/introduction-to-us-sales-tax-and-economic-nexus).\nThroughout Europe, it’s called value-added tax\n([VAT](https://stripe.com/guides/introduction-to-eu-vat-and-european-vat-oss)).\nCanada and most countries in the Asia Pacific region refer to it as goods and\nservices tax ([GST](https://stripe.com/guides/tax-registration-process-canada)).\n\nTaxability and tax rates vary by location and category of products you’re\nselling. For example, children’s footwear is zero rated in Ireland, but adult\nfootwear isn’t. Digital services are usually taxed at the standard rate in most\nEU countries. However, e-books are subject to the reduced rate.\n\n[Stripe Tax](https://stripe.com/tax) uses your business address, tax\nregistrations, product tax codes, customers’ locations, and customer status to\ndetermine the correct tax rates for products you sell, in all supported\nlocations. Read more about [tax\ncodes](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/products-prices-tax-codes-tax-behavior) and\n[how we calculate](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/calculating) for different\njurisdictions.\n\n## Monitor your obligations and register\n\nYou need to identify the locations where you have sales tax, VAT, or GST\nobligations and need to register to collect tax. If you sell into multiple\nlocations, you need to be familiar with the [tax laws in those\nlocations](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries) because the place\nwhere your transaction takes place determines where you’re required to collect\ntax. This can be the seller’s country, the buyer’s country, or another location.\n\nAs your business grows and you sell to more locations, you need to register to\ncollect tax in more locations. Stripe Tax tracks your Stripe transactions and\nhelps you monitor your tax obligations. [Read more about tax obligation\nmonitoring](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/monitoring).\n\nYou must register with the tax authority in a location to collect taxes there.\nIn some countries and states you have to register before your first transaction,\nwhile others have a registration threshold (such as the number of sales or sales\nvolume). Take a look at the [locations Stripe Tax\nsupports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries) along with the\ndifferent tax thresholds that apply and links to the tax authority websites.\n\nStripe Tax tracks your registrations and uses them to calculate and collect\ntaxes. [Read more about adding your registrations to\nStripe](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/registering).\n\nAfter you have registered to collect tax with a tax authority, go to\n[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations) to add your\nregistrations to Stripe in the Dashboard. This turns on tax calculation and\ncollection in Stripe for your transactions.\n\n## Calculate and collect\n\nAfter you [set up Stripe Tax in the\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/set-up), Stripe automatically calculates\nand collects taxes on your transactions. Alternatively you can use [Stripe Tax\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/custom) to calculate taxes on your own custom\npayment flows. In either case, to determine which taxes to collect, you or your\ncustomers have to provide customer location information. [Read more about how\nStripe calculates tax](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/calculating).\n\nIf you sell to other businesses, your transactions might be subject to reverse\ncharges. This means that the tax liability shifts to the customer and we don’t\ncharge tax on the transaction. Stripe Tax uses customer tax identification\nnumbers to determine whether a transaction is B2B. Adding a tax identification\nnumber to the customer might affect the tax calculation result. Stripe Tax\ndoesn’t validate whether the provided tax identification number exists or is\nvalid. [Read about supported tax ID\nformats](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/invoicing/tax-ids#supported-tax-ids).\n\nSome individuals or entities might be tax exempt. For example, some US states\nhave a reseller exemption. You can set an exempt status on customers to reflect\nthis. [Read more about reverse charges and exempt\ncustomers](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/zero-tax).\n\n## Report, file, and remit\n\nIf you’re collecting taxes, you must report, file, and remit (transfer) the\ntaxes collected in every location that you’re registered in. Make sure you\nunderstand and comply with obligations of each state or country and consult your\ntax advisor if you need help. Stripe Tax supports exporting your transactions in\nan itemized format to aid with tax reporting. [Read more about Stripe Tax\nreports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports).\n\nStripe Tax doesn’t currently file or remit taxes on your behalf. Submitting tax\nreturns is key to your tax compliance.
