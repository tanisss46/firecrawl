# Creating a Card or Bank Account with a publishable key omits fingerprints in API responsesBreaking changes

## What’s new

When a card or bank account token is created with a publishable key, the
`fingerprint` property is no longer included in the response.

## Impact

Eliminating the `fingerprint` property in token responses created with
publishable keys improves data privacy.
