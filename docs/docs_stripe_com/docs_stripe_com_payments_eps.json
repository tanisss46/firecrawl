All Austrian banks support EPS, and over\n80% of Austrian online retailers accept it.\n\nEPS redirects customers to their bank’s website to [authenticate a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#customer-actions). You\nreceive [immediate\nnotification](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#payment-notification)\nabout the success or failure of a payment.\n\nPayment method propertiesBusiness locationsProduct support- **Customer\nlocations**\n\nAustria\n- **Presentment currency**\n\nEUR\n- **Payment confirmation**\n\nCustomer-authenticated\n- **Payment method family**\n\nAuthenticated bank debit\n- **Recurring payments**\n\nNo\n- **Payout timing**\n\nStandard payout timing applies\n- **Connect support**\n\nYes\n- **Dispute support**\n\n[No](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/eps#disputed-payments)\n- **Manual capture support**\n\nNo\n- **Refunds / Partial refunds**\n\n[Yes / Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/eps#refunds)\n\n## Payment flow\n\n!\n\nCustomer selects EPS at checkout\n\n!\n\nCustomer chooses their bank and is redirected to that bank’s login page\n\n!\n\nCustomer enters account credentials\n\n!\n\nCustomer completes authorization process (with scanner or SMS)\n\n!\n\nCustomer is notified that payment is complete\n\n!\n\n(Optional) Customer returns back to the business’s site for payment confirmation\n\n## Get started\n\nYou don’t have to integrate EPS and other payment methods individually. If you\nuse our front-end products, Stripe automatically determines the most relevant\npayment methods to display. Go to the [Stripe\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and enable\nEPS. To get started with one of our hosted UIs, follow a quickstart:\n\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart): Our prebuilt, hosted\ncheckout page.\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart): Our drop-in UI\ncomponents.\n\n### Other payment products\n\nThe following Stripe products also let you add EPS from the Dashboard:\n\n- [Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/no-code-guide)\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n\nIf your integration requires manually listing payment methods, learn how to\n[manually configure EPS as a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/eps/accept-a-payment).\n\n## Disputes\n\nThe risk of fraud or unrecognized payments is low because the customer must\nauthenticate the payment with their bank. As a result, you won’t have disputes\nthat turn into chargebacks, with funds withdrawn from your Stripe account.\n\n## Refunds\n\nEPS payments can be refunded up to 180 days after the original payment date.\n\n## Links\n\n- [pricing details](https://stripe.com/pricing/local-payment-methods)\n- [authenticate a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#customer-actions)\n- [immediate\nnotification](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#payment-notification)\n- [No](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/eps#disputed-payments)\n- [Yes / Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/eps#refunds)\n- [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods)\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart)\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart)\n- [Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/no-code-guide)\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n- [manually configure EPS as a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/eps/accept-a-payment)",
