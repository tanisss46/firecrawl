Stripe also\nnotifies you with email and Dashboard alerts when you need to register to\ncollect tax. Learn more about how the [monitoring tool\nworks](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/monitoring).\n\nIf you’re based outside Norway, you must register in Norway as soon as your\ntaxable sales in Norway reach 50,000 NOK during a period of 12 months and no\nreverse charge applies. Businesses located in the [European Economic\nArea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Area) can register\ndirectly with the Norwegian tax administration. Businesses located outside the\nEEA must appoint a Norwegian VAT representative unless they use the simplified\nregistration procedure (VOEC), which is available for B2C sales of digital\nservices and low-value goods (< ​3,000 NOK).\n\nFor example, if you’re based in the US, sell digital services to Norwegian\nconsumers and exceed the threshold during a period of 12 months (from February\nof the past year to January of the current year), you must register in Norway.\nHowever, if you sell digital services only to Norwegian businesses, you don’t\nneed to register because these services are subject to reverse charge.\n\n- **Threshold**: 50,000 NOK\n- **Period**: 12 months\n- **Included transactions**: Any taxable transactions that reverse charge\ndoesn’t apply to.\n\n## Register to collect tax\n\nFind more information on how to register for VAT in Norway on the government\nwebsite:\n\n- [General information about VAT in\nNorway](https://www.skatteetaten.no/en/business-and-organisation/vat-and-duties/vat/)\n- [How to\nregister](https://www.skatteetaten.no/en/business-and-organisation/vat-and-duties/vat/register-change-delete/)\n\nAfter you’ve registered to collect tax in Norway, go to\n[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations?location=no) to\nadd your registrations to Stripe in the Dashboard. This turns on tax calculation\nand collection in Stripe for your transactions in Norway.\n\nLearn more about [how to add your\nregistration](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/registering#track-your-registrations-in-the-tax-dashboard)\nin the Dashboard.\n\n## How we calculate taxes\n\nStripe calculates VAT for your transactions in Norway.\n\nGenerally, most transactions are taxable in the jurisdiction where your customer\nis. Stripe assumes the sale of most goods or services to be taxable unless\nspecifically exempted.\n\nIn Norway, there are some territories outside of the scope of the standard tax\nsystem and might have different rules that apply. Stripe won’t calculate tax for\ncustomers based there, even if you’ve added a registration for Norway. Learn\nmore about how Stripe handles [excluded\nterritories](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/zero-tax?#excluded-territories). This\napplies to the following locations:\n\n- Jan Mayen\n- Svalbard\n\n## Report and file your taxes\n\nStripe Tax has filing partners—Taxually, Marosa, and Hands-off Sales Tax\n(HOST)—to help automate your tax filing. These partners automatically sync your\ntax transaction data in real time, eliminating the need for manual data entry or\nfile transfers. Learn more about [tax\nfiling](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/filing).\n\nStripe also provides reports of your completed tax transactions. Go to\n[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations) to access these\nreports.
