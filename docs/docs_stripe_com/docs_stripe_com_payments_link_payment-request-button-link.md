# Link in the Payment Request Button

## Let your customers check out faster with Link and the Payment Request Button.

#### Caution

Stripe no longer recommends using the Payment Request Button as part of your Web
Elements integration. To integrate Link, use one of our preferred Elements: the
Link Authentication Element, Express Checkout Element, or Payment Element.

When new customers come to your site, they can use
[Link](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link) in the [Payment Request
Button](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-js/elements/payment-request-button) to
pay with their saved payment details. With Link, they don’t need to manually
enter their payment information.

Additionally, Link is fully compatible with the other features you receive from
card payments (for example, subscriptions), and there’re no additional fees. To
turn Link off or on, go to your [payment method
settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods).

Completing payment using Link with the Payment Request Button

## Returning Link customers

Returning customers can authenticate by clicking the **Link** button and
entering an SMS or email code. After they authenticate, Link loads their
previously saved payment details, allowing them to make payments with a single
click. If they previously authenticated their account in the last 90 days,
either on your site or through a different Link-enabled business, they can pay
instantly without re-authenticating. New Link customers are prompted to save
their information in a Link account when they click the **Link** button.

## Link and Connect platforms

Link is automatically available through the Payment Request Button to any
connected accounts that access the Payment Request Button through a Connect
platform integration.

- If you’re a Connect platform, you can manage Link for your connected accounts
through the [payment method
settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) page.
- If you’re a connected account processing payments through a Connect platform,
your platform manages Link for you when payments are processed through the
platform. For payments processed without a platform, you can use the [payment
method settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) page in
your Dashboard to manage Link for the Payment Request Button.
