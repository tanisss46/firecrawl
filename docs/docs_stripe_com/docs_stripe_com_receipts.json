  "content": "# Receipts and paid invoices\n\n## Send payment or refund receipts automatically.\n\nEach receipt contains a link to view it in a browser and a unique [receipt\nnumber](https://docs.stripe.com/api#charge_object-receipt_number) that’s useful\nwhen looking up payment information.\n\nYou can also access the link to view the receipt in a browser through the API in\nthe [PaymentIntent’s](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents) related\n[Charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-receipt_url)\nobject. When you visit the link, the receipt always shows the latest status of\nthat charge—if it has been refunded, the receipt accurately reflects it.\n\nAs a security measure, receipt links expire within 30 days. Expired receipt\nlinks require the customer to provide the original email address to resend the\nreceipt to that address.\n\n## Automatically send receipts\n\nYou can enable automated receipts with:\n\n- [Payment\nLinks](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links/post-payment#send-email-receipts)\n- [Checkout Sessions API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions)-\n[Stripe-hosted\npage](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/receipts?payment-ui=stripe-hosted#automatically-send-receipts)\n- [Embedded\nform](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/receipts?payment-ui=embedded-form#automatically-send-receipts-embedded-form)\n- [Embedded\ncomponents](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/receipts?payment-ui=embedded-components#automatically-send-receipts-embedded-components)\n- [Advanced\nintegrations](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/advanced/receipts#automatically-send-receipts)\n\n## Manually send receipts\n\nTo send receipts in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments),\nclick **Send receipt** within the **Receipt history** section of a Payment\ndetails page. You can also hover over a payment within the **Payments** section\nof a customer’s page and click the **Send receipt** icon. To resend an email\nreceipt, input a different email address, or specify a comma-separated list of\naddresses to send it to several recipients. A record of the last 10 receipts is\nvisible on the payment’s page.\n\nTo give your customer direct access to a receipt through your application, use\nthe\n[receipt_url](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-receipt_url).\n\n## Customize receipts\n\nLearn how to customize receipts with:\n\n- [Payment\nLinks](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links/post-payment#send-email-receipts)\n- [Checkout Sessions\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/receipts#customizing-receipts)-\n[Stripe-hosted\npage](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/receipts?payment-ui=stripe-hosted#customizing-receipts)\n- [Embedded\nform](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/receipts?payment-ui=embedded-form#customizing-receipts-embedded-form)\n- [Embedded\ncomponents](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/receipts?payment-ui=embedded-components#customizing-receipts-embedded-components)\n- [Advanced\nintegrations](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/advanced/receipts#automatically-send-receipts)\n\n## Refund receipts\n\nWhen a payment is refunded, Stripe can automatically send a receipt to the same\nemail address provided in the original charge. You can also use the Dashboard to\nmanually send a copy of the refund receipt. To enable automated refund receipts,\ntoggle **Refunds** on in your [Customer emails\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/emails).\n\n## Invoice and subscription payment receipts\n\nStripe creates a receipt when a customer pays an\n[invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices) or makes any\n[subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating) payment.\nReceipts for subscription and invoice payments are itemized to include line\nitems, discounts, and taxes. After payment, the [Hosted Invoice\nPage](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/hosted-invoice-page) includes a link to\na receipt that the customer can download for their own records.\n\n## Stripe Connect receipts\n\nReceipt settings depend on the charge and account type:\n\n- [Destination charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges) and\n[separate charges and\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers):\nReceipts use the platform account’s **Customer emails**, **Branding**, and\n**Public details** settings.\n- [Direct charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges): Receipts use\nthe connected account’s **Customer emails**, **Branding**, and **Public\ndetails** settings.\n\nPlatform accounts can send a receipt for a connected account by passing\n`receipt_email` when making a charge request.\n\nFor connected accounts that use the Stripe Dashboard (which includes Standard\nconnected accounts), you can configure receipt settings under\n[Branding](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding). For connected\naccounts that don’t use the Dashboard (which includes Express and Custom\nconnected accounts), the platform configures receipt settings through\n[settings.branding](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/update#update_account-settings-branding).\n\n## See also\n\n- [Send customer emails](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/send-email)\n- [Automate customer\nemails](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/revenue-recovery/customer-emails)\n\n## Links\n\n- [test API keys](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes)\n- [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payments)\n- [receipt number](https://docs.stripe.com/api#charge_object-receipt_number)\n- [PaymentIntent’s](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents)\n- [Charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-receipt_url)\n- [Payment\nLinks](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links/post-payment#send-email-receipts)\n- [Checkout Sessions API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions)\n- [Stripe-hosted\npage](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/receipts?payment-ui=stripe-hosted#automatically-send-receipts)\n- [Embedded\nform](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/receipts?payment-ui=embedded-form#automatically-send-receipts-embedded-form)\n- [Embedded\ncomponents](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/receipts?payment-ui=embedded-components#automatically-send-receipts-embedded-components)\n- [Advanced\nintegrations](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/advanced/receipts#automatically-send-receipts)\n- [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments)\n- [Checkout Sessions\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/receipts#customizing-receipts)\n- [Stripe-hosted\npage](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/receipts?payment-ui=stripe-hosted#customizing-receipts)\n- [Embedded\nform](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/receipts?payment-ui=embedded-form#customizing-receipts-embedded-form)\n- [Embedded\ncomponents](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/receipts?payment-ui=embedded-components#customizing-receipts-embedded-components)\n- [Customer emails settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/emails)\n- [invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n- [subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating)\n- [Hosted Invoice Page](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/hosted-invoice-page)\n- [Destination charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges)\n- [separate charges and\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n- [Direct charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges)\n- [Branding](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding)\n-\n[settings.branding](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/update#update_account-settings-branding)\n- [Send customer emails](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/send-email)\n- [Automate customer\nemails](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/revenue-recovery/customer-emails)",
