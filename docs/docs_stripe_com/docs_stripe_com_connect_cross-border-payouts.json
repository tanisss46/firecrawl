Some countries\nalso have special restrictions or requirements that affect cross-border payouts.\nFor details about minimum amounts and other requirements, see [Country-specific\nconsiderations for cross-border\npayouts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/cross-border-payouts/special-requirements).\n\nStripe isn’t responsible for providing direct support for accounts on the\n[recipient service\nagreement](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/service-agreement-types#recipient).\nHowever, the platform can reach out to Stripe for support for these accounts.\n\n## Restrictions and requirements\n\n- The platform must be in the US.\n- Funds must come from separate charges and transfers, destination charges\nwithout `on_behalf_of` (OBO), or top-ups.\n- The platform must be the business of record.
