# Stripe Terminal mobile readers

## Learn about Stripe's pre-certified in-person payment mobile readers.

Terminalâ€™s mobile readers work with iOS, Android, and React Native SDKs and use
Bluetooth Low Energy or USB (on Android devices only) to connect to the SDKs on
a mobile device.

## Reader software updates

Stripe and our hardware partners periodically release reader software updates,
which can include improvements and required security updates. Mobile readers
update themselves automatically upon connection to your point of sale. You must
support updating the readers from your application. Failing to install a
required update can prevent a reader from accepting payments.

#### Note

Mobile readers force a reboot and disconnect from the POS app 24 hours after the
last boot.
