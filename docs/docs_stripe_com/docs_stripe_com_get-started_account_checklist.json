  "content": "# Account checklist\n\n## Complete this checklist before taking your Stripe account live.\n\nThe items in this checklist apply to all Stripe accounts, regardless of how or\nwhere you signed up for Stripe. We also have checklists for [taking your\nintegration live](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/checklist/go-live) and\nadhering to [website payment best\npractices](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/checklist/website). For the\nsafety and security of your Stripe account, follow these steps before going\nlive:\n\n- Enable two-step authentication\nFor security purposes, [enable two-factor authentication\n(2FA)](https://support.stripe.com/questions/how-do-i-enable-two-step-verification)\non your Stripe account. Two-factor authentication requires that you log in with\nboth your username and password, and enter a code sent to your mobile device.\nUsing 2FA makes it harder for someone else to access your Stripe account.\n- Confirm your statement descriptor and public information\nThe [statement\ndescriptor](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/activate#public-business-information)\nappears on customer statements when you charge their card. Missing or incorrect\ninformation can result in confused customers creating disputes, so make sure to\nreview your statement descriptor in the\n[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public). Statement descriptors\nare limited to between 5 and 22 characters. They must contain at least 5 letters\nand can’t use the following special characters: `<`, `>`, `\\`, `'`, or `\"`.\nStripe also recommends that you add text to your site that tells your users what\nthey’ll see on their statements.\n\nThe card issuer can automatically include other account information—for example,\nbusiness name, address, email, or phone number—to show on your customer’s\nstatements. Check that all of this information in your Stripe account is\nacceptable for your customers to see.\n- Set up email notifications\nStripe can notify you of account activity by email. You can choose events to be\nnotified of in your [Communication\npreferences](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/communication-preferences).\nIf multiple [team members](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/teams)\nhave access to your account, each one can set their own notification\npreferences. At a minimum, we recommend turning on emails for successful charges\nand disputes.\n- Set up SMS from Stripe for critical account health updates\nChoose the events to receive notification of in your [Communication\npreferences](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/communication-preferences).\nAny [team member](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/teams) with\naccount access can set their own notification preferences.\n- Prevent and manage fraud and disputes\n[Fraud and disputes](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention) are\nunfortunate realities in all commerce. While Stripe is constantly improving its\ntools to help reduce these incidents, we recommend that you’re set up to:\n\n- Regularly review [payments in the\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payments).\n- [Report charges](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/risk-evaluation) that appear\nsuspicious using the Dashboard or API.\n- Have [evidence](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/responding#respond) at the\nready for disputes.\n- Prevent and mitigate [card\ntesting](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/card-testing).\n- Review your bank account information\nIncorrect bank information is a common cause of [payout\ndelays](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts#payout-failures). Before accepting live\ncharges, confirm [your bank\ndetails](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payouts) are correct. If you\nprocess charges in [multiple currencies](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies) and\nhave multiple bank accounts, also confirm you’ve established the correct default\ncurrency. Multiple bank accounts for additional currencies are optional as\nStripe can convert any payments into your default currency.\n\nWhen reviewing your bank information, set your preferred [payout\nschedule](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts#payout-schedule). The recommended and\ndefault option is daily—as funds become available—but you can change this to\nbest suit your business and reporting needs.\n- Give your team members access to your Stripe account\nYou can give your [team\nmembers](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/teams) access to your\nStripe account. Stripe even lets you give different team members different\npermissions depending on their\n[roles](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/teams/roles).\n\nWhenever you give a team member access to your Stripe account, don’t give them\nyour login credentials. We also recommend that you ask your team members to\nenable 2FA.\n\nIf a team member no longer needs access to your Stripe account, remove them from\nyour account.\n- Understand industry-specific restrictions \nReview our [Prohibited & Restricted businesses\nlist](https://stripe.com/legal/restricted-businesses) to determine if your\nbusiness operates in an industry that Stripe restricts or prohibits.\n\nIf your business operates in a restricted industry, you might need to provide\nadditional documentation before you can use Stripe as your payment processor. If\nyour business operates in a prohibited industry, you won’t be able to use\nStripe.\n\nIf you have any questions about onboarding requirements or restrictions\napplicable to your business, [contact us](https://stripe.com/contact).\n\n## See also\n\n- [Multiple\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/multiple-accounts)\n- [Start a team](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/teams)\n- [Custom email\ndomain](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/email-domain)\n\n## Links\n\n- [log in](https://dashboard.stripe.com/)\n- [taking your integration\nlive](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/checklist/go-live)\n- [website payment best\npractices](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/checklist/website)\n- [enable two-factor authentication\n(2FA)](https://support.stripe.com/questions/how-do-i-enable-two-step-verification)\n- [statement\ndescriptor](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/activate#public-business-information)\n- [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public)\n- [Communication\npreferences](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/communication-preferences)\n- [team members](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/teams)\n- [Fraud and disputes](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention)\n- [payments in the Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payments)\n- [Report charges](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/risk-evaluation)\n- [evidence](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/responding#respond)\n- [card testing](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/card-testing)\n- [payout delays](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts#payout-failures)\n- [your bank details](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payouts)\n- [multiple currencies](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies)\n- [payout schedule](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts#payout-schedule)\n- [roles](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/teams/roles)\n- [Prohibited & Restricted businesses\nlist](https://stripe.com/legal/restricted-businesses)\n- [contact us](https://stripe.com/contact)\n- [Multiple\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/multiple-accounts)\n- [Custom email\ndomain](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/email-domain)",
