You can enable Stripe Tax to automatically\ncompute taxes on all of your Checkout purchases and subscriptions.\n\n[Activate Stripe Tax](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/taxes#activate)\n[Log in](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/tax) or [sign\nup](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register) for Stripe to activate Stripe Tax.\n\n## Update your Products and Prices\n\nWhen calculating tax, Stripe Tax uses information stored on the\n[Products](https://docs.stripe.com/api/products) and\n[Prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices) APIs to determine the right rates\nand rules. You can update your Checkout products and prices to include:\n\n- `tax_behavior`—Specifies whether the price is considered `inclusive` or\n`exclusive` of taxes.\n- `tax_code` (*optional*)—Specifies the product tax code. If you don’t set a\n`tax_code` on a product, we apply your preset product tax code. For more\ninformation, consult our [list of tax\ncodes](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes).\n\nWhen you set the `tax_behavior` parameter to `exclusive`, it adds tax to the\nsubtotal. This is common in US markets and for business-to-business (B2B) sales.\nIf you set the `tax_behavior` to `inclusive`, the amount your buyer pays never\nchanges (even if the tax rate varies). This is common practice for\nbusiness-to-consumer (B2C) buyers in markets outside of the US. If you don’t\nwant to create your products and prices upfront, you can pass the\n`price_data.tax_behavior` and `product_data.tax_code` parameters in your\nCheckout session.\n\n#### Note\n\nLearn more about [Products, prices, tax codes, and tax\nbehavior](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/products-prices-tax-codes-tax-behavior).\n\n## Create a Checkout Session\n\nAfter updating your products and prices, you’re ready to start calculating tax\non your Checkout sessions. You can create sessions for one-time and recurring\npurchases.\n\nTo calculate tax for new customers, Checkout validates and uses the provided\nshipping or billing address. For existing customers, Checkout calculates tax by\nvalidating and using the attached customer shipping or billing address. If you\ncapture a new billing or shipping address for an existing customer, Checkout\nwon’t automatically override the previous billing or shipping information. You\nmust explicitly request customer address changes.\n\n### Apple Pay and Google Pay\n\nIf you wish to ensure that Google Pay is offered as a payment method while using\nStripe Tax in Checkout, you must require collecting a shipping address. Apple\nPay with Stripe Tax displays only when the customer’s browser supports Apple Pay\nversion 12 or greater.\n\n## Calculate tax for new customers\n\nIf you don’t pass in an existing customer when creating a Checkout session,\nCheckout creates a new customer and automatically saves the billing address and\nshipping information. Checkout uses the shipping address entered during the\nsession to determine the customer’s location for calculating tax. If you don’t\ncollect shipping information, Checkout uses the billing address.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/checkout/sessions \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d \"line_items[0][price]\"={{PRICE_ID}} \\\n -d \"line_items[0][quantity]\"=2 \\\n -d \"automatic_tax[enabled]\"=true \\\n -d mode=payment \\\n -d ui_mode=embedded \\\n --data-urlencode return_url=\"https://example.com/return\"\n```\n\n[OptionalCalculate tax for existing\ncustomers](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/taxes#existing-customers)[OptionalCheck\nthe\nresponse](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/taxes#check-the-response)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Log in](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/tax)\n- [sign up](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register)\n- [Products](https://docs.stripe.com/api/products)\n- [Prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices)\n- [list of tax codes](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes)\n- [Products, prices, tax codes, and tax\nbehavior](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/products-prices-tax-codes-tax-behavior)\n- [https://example.com/return](https://example.com/return)",
