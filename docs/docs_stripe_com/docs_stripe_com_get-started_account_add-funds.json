These\nfunds are held separately from your earnings,\n[payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts), and funds from other Stripe\nproducts.\n\n## Add funds\n\nTo add funds to your balance using the Dashboard:\n\n- Determine how much you want to add to your balance.\n- Go to the [Balances](https://dashboard.stripe.com/balance/overview) page in\nthe Dashboard, and click **Add to balance**.\n- Select whether you want to use a wire or local bank transfer, review Stripe’s\nbank information, and click **Done**.\n- Initiate the transfer from your bank account.\n- After your bank has sent the funds, return to\n[Balances](https://dashboard.stripe.com/balance/overview), and click **Add to\nbalance**.\n- *(Optional)* If the dialog prompts you for a receipt, upload a screenshot or\nthe file that proves that your bank transferred the funds.\n\n- To fund your Stripe balance faster, we might ask you to include a screenshot\nor PDF of your bank’s transfer or wire confirmation.\n- Click **Confirm Transfer**.\n\n![Add to your\nbalance](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/balance.33f25616b262a378ffd6c0623ef9f5ac.png)\n\nAdd to your balance\n\n## View and use your funds\n\nTo see the total amount of funds set aside for future refunds, disputes, or\nnegative balances, go to **Future refunds or disputes or negative balance** in\nthe [Balances](https://dashboard.stripe.com/balance/overview) page. Stripe uses\nthese funds first when it processes a refund or a customer disputes a payment.\nIf no funds remain, we process refunds and disputes from your available balance.\nIf you receive an email from Stripe about debiting your bank account, first\ncheck your balance.\n\n#### Payouts\n\nIf you don’t need to have extra funds set aside, you can pay them out to your\nbank.\n\n## Settlement timing\n\nFunds typically show up in your balance within 1 to 7 business days, depending\non the method used to add funds. For ACH transfers, it usually takes 1 to 5\nbusiness days.\n\nTo have funds settle to your account without delay, make sure the wire or\ntransfer from your bank includes your Stripe unique reference code in the\ntransfer memo. Find this unique reference code on the\n[Balances](https://dashboard.stripe.com/balance/overview) page in the Dashboard.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Add funds to your platform balance](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/top-ups)\n- [Manage prorations for modified\nsubscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/prorations)\n\n## Links\n\n- [add funds to your platform balance](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/top-ups)\n- [payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts)\n- [Balances](https://dashboard.stripe.com/balance/overview)\n- [Manage prorations for modified\nsubscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/prorations)",
