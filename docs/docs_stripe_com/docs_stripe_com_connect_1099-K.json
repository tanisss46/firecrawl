Filing requirements for some states might differ from federal\nrequirements.\n\nWe outline state filing requirements for 1099-K forms to help you identify which\n[states you can file\ndirectly](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/tax-forms-state-requirements) in your\nDashboard, which states require a state tax registration or withholding ID when\nfiling, and which states you’re responsible for filing directly with.\n\n#### Warning\n\nIf you have done backup withholding or state withholding, you might have\nadditional reporting requirements with states. We recommend that you consult a\ntax advisor.\n\nSTATE 1099-K FILING REQUIRED DOES STRIPE FILE FILING DUE DATE* FILING THRESHOLD\nIF ISSUED, PROVIDE STATE NUMBER AlabamaState PortalApril 30Same as IRS–AlaskaNo\n–\n\n–-–ArizonaIf State WitholdingSame as IRS$0–ArkansasCFSFSame as\nIRS$2,500–CaliforniaCFSFSame as IRSSame as IRS–ColoradoIf State WitholdingSame\nas IRS$0–ConnecticutState PortalApril 30Same as IRSConnecticut Tax Registration\nNumberDelawareNo\n–\n\n–-–District of ColumbiaState PortalSame as IRS$600–FloridaState PortalApril\n30Same as IRS–GeorgiaState PortalSame as IRSSame as IRS–HawaiiCFSFSame as\nIRSSame as IRS–IdahoNo\n–\n\n–-–IllinoisState PortalSame as IRS$1,000 and 4 transactions–IndianaIf State\nWitholdingSame as IRS$0–IowaIf State WitholdingFebruary 15$0–KansasCFSFSame as\nIRSSame as IRSKansas Withholding Tax Account NumberKentuckyIf State\nWitholdingSame as IRS$0–LouisianaIf State WitholdingSame as IRS$0–MaineState\nPortal–Same as IRS–MarylandState PortalSame as IRS$600Maryland Central\nRegistration NumberMassachusettsState PortalSame as IRS$600–MichiganNo\n–\n\n–-–MinnesotaIf State WitholdingSame as IRS$0–MississippiCFSF–Same as\nIRS–MissouriNo\n–\n\n–-–MontanaState PortalApril 1$600–NebraskaNo\n–\n\n–-–NevadaNo\n–\n\n–-–New HampshireNo\n–\n\n–-–New JerseyCFSFSame as IRS$1,000–New MexicoNo\n–\n\n–-–New YorkState PortalApril 30Same as IRS–North CarolinaState PortalSame as\nIRS$600NC Withholding ID Number or EINNorth DakotaIf State WitholdingSame as\nIRS$0–OhioNo\n–\n\n–-–OklahomaNo\n–\n\n–-–OregonState PortalSame as IRSSame as IRS–PennsylvaniaNo\n–\n\n–-–Rhode IslandIf State WitholdingSame as IRS$100–South CarolinaIf State\nWitholdingSame as IRS$0SC Withholding File Number or EINSouth DakotaNo\n–\n\n–-–TennesseeState PortalApril 30Same as IRS–TexasNo\n–\n\n–-–UtahIf State WitholdingSame as IRS$0–VermontState PortalApril 30$600Vermont\nWithholding Account NumberVirginiaState PortalApril 30$600–WashingtonNo\n–\n\n–-–West VirginiaIf State WitholdingSame as IRS$0–WisconsinIf State\nWitholdingSame as IRS$0Wisconsin Withholding Tax Number**WyomingNo\n–\n\n–-–\n*January 22, 2025 is the latest recommended date to file forms with the IRS and\nstates in your Stripe Dashboard\n\n**If a Wisconsin withholding tax number isn’t provided, Stripe uses the default\nvalue of `036888888888801` instead.\n\n## How to interpret form state requirements\n\nStripe supports filing in all states that require 1099-K filing and don’t have\nwithholding-based filing requirements. When you file your 1099-K forms from the\n[Tax forms view](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/taxes/forms) in the\nDashboard, Stripe submits your forms to the IRS and all qualifying states.\n\n### 1099-K FILING REQUIRED\n\nState PortalStripe submits the forms directly to these states. An additional\nstate filing fee of 1.49 USD applies per 1099-K form filed directly with state\nrevenue authorities.\nCFSF\n\nStates listed as CFSF are part of the Combined Federal / State Filing (CFSF)\nprogram. Forms filed to the IRS are automatically forwarded to the state,\neliminating separate reporting to the participating states. If forms have\nalready been filed with the IRS, you won’t be charged an additional state filing\nfee for filing in these states.\n\nSome states still require direct filing with the state, even though they\nparticipate in the CFSF program. Stripe submits the forms directly to these\nstates.\n\nIf State WithholdingYou’re required to file a 1099-K form with that state only\nif you withheld state taxes. In your Dashboard, you can specify the amount\nwithheld by updating the form and updating the `state_tax_withheld` column. When\nyou file your 1099-K forms in the Dashboard, we automatically export forms\neligible for state filing and with `state_tax_withheld` so you can file directly\nwith applicable states.\n#### Note\n\nSome forms that appear to be below the federal filing threshold can also appear\nas `Ready` or `Needs attention` due to Grouped TINs or state filing thresholds.\n[Learn\nmore](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/file-tax-forms#below-threshold-forms)\n\n### FILING DUE DATE\n\nWhile the IRS filing deadline for 1099-K forms is March 31 and the IRS deadline\nto deliver 1099 forms to your payees is January 31, we coupled filing and\ndelivery together to streamline the tax reporting process. **January 22, 2025**\nis the latest recommended date to file forms with the IRS and states in your\nStripe Dashboard. This guarantees forms are filed with the IRS and a copy is\nsent to the recipients before the IRS delivery deadline of January 31.\n\n### STATE NUMBERS\n\nState Tax Registration or Withholding IDs are only required for some states.\nAfter you obtain the registration or withholding ID, add the states in which\nyou’ll file and the corresponding IDs on the [Tax forms\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/tax_forms) page. In the\nDashboard, click **Settings**. On **Product settings**, under **Connect**, click\n**Tax form settings**. When filing forms in your Dashboard, you must provide an\nappropriate ID in states that require one.\n\n## See also\n\n- [File form with\nstates](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/tax-forms-state-requirements)\n- [Add the state tax Registration or withholding\nID](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/tax-forms-state-requirements#add-state-reg)\n\n## Links\n\n- [states you can file\ndirectly](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/tax-forms-state-requirements)\n- [Tax forms view](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/taxes/forms)\n- [Learn\nmore](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/file-tax-forms#below-threshold-forms)\n- [Tax forms settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/tax_forms)\n- [Add the state tax Registration or withholding\nID](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/tax-forms-state-requirements#add-state-reg)",
