However, Tax isn’t\ncollected on a transaction in some situations, and the resulting tax amount is\nzero. For example, if you’re expanding `tax_amounts` on an\n[invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices), you might see something like:\n\n```\n{\n \"id\": \"in_1HF0KNFsnTpWVWVzFDgSizOj\",\n \"object\": \"invoice\",\n ...\n \"total_details\": {\n \"amount_tax\": 0,\n \"breakdown\": {\n \"taxes\": [\n {\n \"amount\": 0,\n \"taxability_reason\": \"not_collecting\",\n \"rate\": {\n \"id\": \"txr_1HHwa4Jm3J7Jh9FBnYJ9glJZ\",\n \"object\": \"tax_rate\",\n \"description\": \"VAT Germany\",\n \"display_name\": \"VAT\",\n \"country\": \"DE\",\n \"created\": 1597863856,\n \"inclusive\": false,\n \"jurisdiction\": \"DE\",\n \"livemode\": false,\n \"metadata\": {},\n \"percentage\": 0.0,\n \"state\": null,\n \"tax_type\": \"vat\",\n \"active\": false,\n }\n }\n ]\n },\n },\n ...\n}\n```\n\nThe API returns the reason for a tax result in the\n[taxability_reason](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoice-line-item/object#invoice_line_item_object-tax_amounts-taxability_reason)\nfield.\n\nThe most common reasons for a zero tax result are the following:\n\nReasontaxability_reasonExplanationNot registered`not_collecting`You must\nregister before collecting tax in a jurisdiction. You can specify where you’re\nregistered to collect tax on [the Tax settings\npage](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/tax).Exempt or zero-rated\nproducts`product_exempt`Certain products are exempt from tax or zero-rated. In\nboth cases the buyer doesn’t pay tax.Reverse charge`reverse_charge`Transactions\nbetween two businesses might be subject to reverse charge. In these cases, the\nbuyer is responsible for accounting for the VAT due under the reverse\ncharge.Exempt customers`customer_exempt`Some customers are exempt from paying\nindirect tax in certain jurisdictions. You can specify when a customer is exempt\non the Customer object.Excluded territory`not_supported`Some countries have\nadministrative subdivisions or territories, with the geographic region being\noutside the scope of the associated country’s VAT system. A list of these\nexcluded territories is below.\n\n!\n\nThe tax outcome for each payment is available when viewing a payment in [the\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/) under Taxability.\n\n## Situations where Stripe calculates zero tax\n\nStripe Tax calculates zero tax in the following situations:\n\n### Not registered\n\nTaxing authorities require businesses to obtain a license or otherwise register\nbefore starting to collect tax in their jurisdiction. Each jurisdiction has\ntheir own rules regarding when you’re obligated to register and begin collecting\nand remitting tax. Obligations can arise from, but are not limited to, a\nphysical presence in the jurisdiction or from reaching a threshold of sales into\na jurisdiction. For example, as of February 2021, for businesses based outside\nof California (for example, no physical presence), you only need to register\nwhen you surpass 500,000 USD in sales.\n\nStripe automatically aggregates and analyzes your transactions and compares them\nto local thresholds. See\n[Thresholds](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/thresholds) to get insights about\nyour potential tax registration obligations.\n\nLearn more about how to [register for sales tax, VAT, and\nGST](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries) in each location and, if\nyou’re a Connect platform, how to [use the Registrations API to manage tax\nregistrations](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/registrations-api). You can also use\n[Stripe to register](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/use-stripe-to-register) on your\nbehalf.\n\n### Exempt or zero rated products\n\nProducts might be exempt or nontaxable in some jurisdictions. For example, as of\nFebruary 2021, the state of California considers software as a service to be a\nnontaxable service. The buyer pays no tax and the seller usually can’t reclaim\nany credits from costs associated with producing the product.\n\nProducts can also be zero-rated, meaning while they’re technically taxable, the\napplied rate is 0%. For example, as of February 2021, children’s clothing is\nzero-rated in Ireland. The buyer pays no tax, however the seller might be able\nto reclaim credits from costs associated with producing the product.\n\nThe tax treatment of products not only varies by jurisdiction but is subject to\nchange. If you don’t want to collect tax on a given product, you can assign the\nproduct tax code Nontaxable (`txcd_00000000`) to it, to make sure Stripe Tax\ntreats it as a nontaxable product. Otherwise, Stripe Tax automatically\ndetermines when a product is exempt or zero rated.\n\n### Reverse charges\n\nWhile in most transactions, the seller is responsible for collecting and\nremitting tax owed by the buyer, in a reverse charge transaction the buyer must\ncalculate and remit the tax. In that case, the seller’s invoice specifies that\nthe transaction is a reverse charge and doesn’t include tax in the total amount.\nA reverse charge is common in cross-border B2B supply of services. For example,\nfor businesses with an origin address in the EU, the following logic applies:\n\nBuyers fromB2CB2BSame EU countryCharge VATCharge VATDifferent EU countryCharge\nVATNo VAT (reverse charge)\nStripe Tax automatically applies the right logic depending on the presence of a\ntax ID and the jurisdictions involved in the transaction.\n\nFor transactions with `inclusive` tax behavior where reverse charge applies, the\nbuyer pays the full `unit_amount` Price, but isn’t charged tax. In these cases,\na “Reverse Charge” indicator appears in the Stripe Dashboard, and the Invoice\nreads “Tax to be paid on reverse charge basis” instead of zero.\n\nYou can set a customer’s\n[tax_exempt](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-tax_exempt)\nattribute to `reverse` even if you haven’t collected their tax ID in Stripe.\n\nYou can also instruct Checkout to collect tax IDs from your customers by setting\n[tax_id_collection](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object#checkout_session_object-tax_id_collection).\nFor one-time Checkout purchases not associated with a Customer object, Checkout\ncollects and stores the customer’s tax exemption status and supplied tax IDs in\n[customer_details](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object#checkout_session_object-customer_details)\non the completed Checkout Session object. You’re responsible for making sure\nthat customer information is accurate (including their supplied tax\nidentification numbers).\n\nThe following examples show invoices generated with and without a known customer\ntax ID:\n\n- [Customer’s tax ID automates reverse charge\n(PDF)](https://d37ugbyn3rpeym.cloudfront.net/docs/files/billing/taxes/example-reverse-charge.pdf)\n- [Explicitly set reverse charge\n(PDF)](https://d37ugbyn3rpeym.cloudfront.net/docs/files/billing/taxes/example-reverse-charge-customer.pdf)\n\nStripe displays the provided customer tax ID on an invoice, regardless of\nwhether it’s valid. Stripe Tax automatically validates the tax ID format against\nthe expected format and the tax ID value against external tax authority systems\nfor certain countries.\n\n[Learn more about Tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/tax-ids)\n\n## Exempt customers\n\nExempt customers are those who under a jurisdiction’s rules can make tax-exempt\npurchases. Each taxing jurisdiction determines the type of individuals or\nentities who can make tax-exempt purchases. Common examples are nonprofit\norganizations and government entities.\n\nIf you have customers that are exempt from paying tax, set their tax status to\n`exempt` and provide the customer ID when creating a subscription, invoice, or\nCheckout Session. To set a customer’s exempt status, use the API to set\n[tax_exempt](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-tax_exempt)\nto `exempt` or use the Dashboard:\n\n- On the [Customers page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/customers), select the\ncustomer.\n- Open the overflow menu () and select **Edit information**.\n- Scroll to the **Tax status** section and select **Exempt** from the dropdown.\n\nFor transactions with `inclusive` tax behavior where the customer is exempt, the\nbuyer pays the full `unit_amount` Price, but there’s no tax charged. In these\ncases, an “Exempt” indicator appears in the Stripe Dashboard and the Invoice\nreads “Customer is tax exempt” instead of zero.\n\n[Download example exempt invoice\nPDF](https://d37ugbyn3rpeym.cloudfront.net/docs/files/billing/taxes/example-exempt.pdf)\n\nStripe Tax automatically calculates an exemption on the transaction when you set\n[tax_exempt](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-tax_exempt)\non the `Customer` object, but it doesn’t perform any validation of required\ndocumentation for supporting an exemption, such as customer exemption\ncertificates. You are responsible for determining and fulfilling any obligation\nto validate your customer’s exempt status and collect any required\ndocumentation, such as an exemption certificate. [EXEMPTAX offers a Stripe\nApp](https://marketplace.stripe.com/apps/exemptax) that you can use to collect\nand verify exemption certificates.\n\n## Excluded territories\n\n#### Note\n\nStripe Tax fees apply to transactions in excluded territories if you’re\nregistered in the country the territory is located in.\n\nSome countries include administrative subdivisions or territories that are\noutside the scope of their general VAT system. In some of these territories no\ntax is levied, while others may have their own tax regulations and rates.\n\nStripe Tax does not calculate tax in the territories listed below even if you’re\nregistered in the country where the territory belongs to. Stripe Tax\nautomatically determines if your customer is based in an excluded or unsupported\nterritory using the postal code and jurisdiction name.\n\nCountryExcluded TerritoriesAndora- Andora\nDenmark- Faroe Islands\n- Greenland\nFinland- Åland Islands\nFrance- French Guyana\n- French Polynesia\n- Guadalupe\n- Martinique\n- Mayotte\n- Reunion\n- Saint Barthélemy\n- Saint Martin\n- Saint Pierre and Miquelon\n- Wallis and Futuna\nItaly- Vatican City\nLiechtenstein- Liechtenstein\nMonaco- Monaco\nNetherlands- Aruba\n- Bonaire\n- Curacao\n- Saba\n- Sint Eustatius\n- Sint Maarten\nNorway- Jan Mayen\n- Svalbard\nPortugal- Azores\n- Madeira\nSan Marino- San Marino\nSpain- Canary Islands\n- Ceuta\n- Melilla\nUnited Kingdom- British Virgin Islands\n- Channel Islands (Guernsey and Jersey)\n- Falkland Islands\n- Gibraltar\n\n## See also\n\n- [Determining customer\nlocations](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/customer-locations)\n- [Set up Stripe Tax](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/set-up)\n- [Use Stripe to register](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/use-stripe-to-register)\n- [Reporting and filing](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Log in](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/tax)\n- [sign up](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register)\n- [invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n-\n[taxability_reason](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoice-line-item/object#invoice_line_item_object-tax_amounts-taxability_reason)\n- [the Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/)\n- [Thresholds](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/thresholds)\n- [register for sales tax, VAT, and\nGST](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries)\n- [use the Registrations API to manage tax\nregistrations](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/registrations-api)\n- [Stripe to register](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/use-stripe-to-register)\n-\n[tax_exempt](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-tax_exempt)\n-\n[tax_id_collection](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object#checkout_session_object-tax_id_collection)\n-\n[customer_details](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object#checkout_session_object-customer_details)\n- [Customer’s tax ID automates reverse charge\n(PDF)](https://d37ugbyn3rpeym.cloudfront.net/docs/files/billing/taxes/example-reverse-charge.pdf)\n- [Explicitly set reverse charge\n(PDF)](https://d37ugbyn3rpeym.cloudfront.net/docs/files/billing/taxes/example-reverse-charge-customer.pdf)\n- [Learn more about Tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/tax-ids)\n- [Customers page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/customers)\n- [Download example exempt invoice\nPDF](https://d37ugbyn3rpeym.cloudfront.net/docs/files/billing/taxes/example-exempt.pdf)\n- [EXEMPTAX offers a Stripe App](https://marketplace.stripe.com/apps/exemptax)\n- [Determining customer\nlocations](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/customer-locations)\n- [Set up Stripe Tax](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/set-up)\n- [Reporting and filing](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports)",
