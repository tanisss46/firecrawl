# Payment Links

## Sell online without building a digital storefront.

Accept a payment or sell subscriptions without building additional standalone
websites or applications with Payment Links. Share the link as many times as you
want on social media, in emails, or on your website.

Payment Links supports [more than 20 payment
methods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/payment-method-support#product-support)—including
credit and debit cards, Apple Pay, and Google Pay. The payment link
automatically uses your customer’s preferred browser language in [more than 30
languages](https://support.stripe.com/questions/supported-languages-for-stripe-checkout-and-payment-links).
