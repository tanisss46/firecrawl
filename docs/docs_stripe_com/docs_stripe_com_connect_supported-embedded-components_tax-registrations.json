Your connected accounts interact with this component by managing\ntheir tax registrations directly in your platform. This component is suitable\nfor [software platforms](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-for-platforms), which\nmeans that your connected accounts are liable to collect taxes.\n\nIf you’re a platform integrating Stripe Tax, you must collect information about\nthe [registrations with tax\nauthorities](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/registering) of your connected accounts\nin the applicable jurisdictions. Your connected accounts need to register with\ntheir tax authorities before they add their tax registrations in your platform.\nTo correctly calculate and collect taxes for your platform, you must collect the\ntax registrations of your connected accounts.\n\nSizeDesktopLocale (United States)This demo is read-only with limited\nfunctionality. Visit [furever.dev](https://furever.dev/) for a fully functional\ndemo.\nThe Tax registrations component uses the [Tax Registrations\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/registrations-api) to display a list of tax\nregistrations to your connected accounts. To calculate tax on their payments in\na location, connected accounts need to add their tax registration with the Tax\nregistrations component. If the connected account wish to stop calculating tax\nin a certain location, they can end the tax registration in the component.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Your integration must follow the [software platforms\nguide](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-for-platforms) for [Tax on\nConnect](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/connect). This means that your connected\naccounts are liable to collect taxes.\n- If you haven’t already, render the [Tax settings\ncomponent](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/supported-embedded-components/tax-settings).\nYou need both the Tax settings component and the Tax registrations component to\nprovide tax compliance control to your connected accounts.\n\n## Integrate the tax registrations component\n\nWhen [creating an Account\nSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions/create), enable tax\nregistrations by specifying `tax_registrations` in the `components` parameter.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/account_sessions \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d account={{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}} \\\n -d \"components[tax_registrations][enabled]\"=true\n```\n\nAfter creating the account session and [initializing\nConnectJS](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components#account-sessions),\nyou can render the tax registrations component in the frontend:\n\n```\n// Include this React component\nimport {\n ConnectTaxRegistrations,\n ConnectComponentsProvider,\n} from \"@stripe/react-connect-js\";\n\nreturn (\n <ConnectComponentsProvider connectInstance={stripeConnectInstance}>\n <div>\n <h2>Tax Registrations</h2>\n <ConnectTaxRegistrations\n // Optional\n // displayCountries={[\"US\", \"CA\", \"DE\"]}\n// onAfterTaxRegistrationAdded={({id: registrationId}) =>\nconsole.log({registrationId})}\n />\n </div>\n </ConnectComponentsProvider>\n);\n```\n\nHTML + JSReactMethodTypeDescriptionDefault`setDisplayCountries``string[]`Array\nof [two-letter country codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2)\nthat the connected account can [choose from for a new tax\nregistration](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax/registrations/object#tax_registration_object-country_options).undefined\n(all countries permitted)`setOnAfterTaxRegistrationAdded``({id: string}) =>\nvoid`Callback executed with an object containing the newly added tax\nregistration IDundefined (not a required method)\n## Limitations\n\nThe following features are available in the Dashboard and the API, but aren’t\ncurrently supported by the Tax registrations component:\n\n- Scheduling start or end dates for registrations. You can only create or end\nregistrations immediately.\n- Specifying US state sales tax elections when creating tax registrations.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Tax on Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/connect)\n- [Tax for software platforms](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-for-platforms)\n- [Tax settings\ncomponent](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/supported-embedded-components/tax-settings)\n\n## Links\n\n- [software platforms](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-for-platforms)\n- [registrations with tax authorities](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/registering)\n- [furever.dev](https://furever.dev)\n- [Tax Registrations API](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/registrations-api)\n- [Tax on Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/connect)\n- [Tax settings\ncomponent](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/supported-embedded-components/tax-settings)\n- [creating an Account\nSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions/create)\n- [initializing\nConnectJS](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components#account-sessions)\n- [two-letter country codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2)\n- [choose from for a new tax\nregistration](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax/registrations/object#tax_registration_object-country_options)",
