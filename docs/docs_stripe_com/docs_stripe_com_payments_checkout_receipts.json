The upper limit for a\ncustom logo image file size is 512KB. Ideally, the logo should be a square image\nexceeding 128 x 128 pixels. JPG, PNG, and GIF file types are supported.\n- **Public information**: Specify the public information you want to include,\nsuch as your contact number or website address, in your [Public details\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public).\n\nTo display custom text, use the\n[payment_intent_data.description](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-payment_intent_data-description)\nattribute on the [Checkout\nSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object). Some examples\ninclude:\n\n- Description of goods or services provided\n- Authorization code\n- Subscription information\n- Cancellation policies\n\nYou can see a real-time preview of your email receipt on your Dashboard Branding\nsettings page. To send a test receipt, hover over the preview image and click\n**Send test receipt**, then enter your email address.\n\n#### Caution\n\nReceipts pull data from the `Charge` object generated when the PaymentIntent is\nconfirmed. To update receipt data such as the `description` after the charge is\ngenerated, you must [update the\nCharge](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/update). Changes to a confirmed\nPaymentIntent don’t appear on receipts.\n\n## Automatically send paid invoices\n\nIn addition to ordinary receipts, Checkout can generate paid invoices as proof\nof payment. Invoices have more information than receipts. For subscriptions,\nStripe generates invoices automatically, but for one-time payments, you need to\nenable them.\n\n#### Note\n\nInvoice creation for one-time payments through the [Checkout Sessions\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions) is not an\n[Invoicing](https://stripe.com/invoicing) feature, and is priced separately.\nReview [this support\narticle](https://support.stripe.com/questions/pricing-for-post-payment-invoices-for-one-time-purchases-via-checkout-and-payment-links)\nto learn more.\n\nTo generate invoices, first, in your [Customer emails\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/emails), under **Email customers\nabout**, select **Successful payments**. Then, when creating a Checkout session,\nset\n[invoice_creation[enabled]](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-invoice_creation-enabled)\nto `true`.\n\n#### Note\n\nEnabling `invoice_creation` isn’t supported if you set\n`payment_intent_data[capture_method]` to `manual`.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/checkout/sessions \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d mode=payment \\\n -d \"invoice_creation[enabled]\"=true \\\n -d \"line_items[0][price]\"={{ONE_TIME_PRICE_ID}} \\\n -d \"line_items[0][quantity]\"=1 \\\n --data-urlencode success_url=\"https://example.com\" \\\n --data-urlencode cancel_url=\"https://example.com\"\n```\n\nAfter the payment completes, Stripe sends an invoice summary with links to\ndownload the invoice PDF and invoice receipt to the email address your customer\nprovides during checkout.\n\n#### Caution\n\nInvoices for delayed notification payment methods might take longer to send\nbecause we send the invoice after successful payment, not upon checkout session\ncompletion. These methods include: [Bacs Direct\nDebit](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bacs-debit/accept-a-payment), [Bank\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bank-transfers/accept-a-payment),\n[Boleto](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/boleto/accept-a-payment), [Canadian\npre-authorized\ndebits](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/acss-debit/accept-a-payment),\n[Konbini](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/konbini/accept-a-payment),\n[OXXO](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/oxxo/accept-a-payment), [Pay by\nBank](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/pay-by-bank/accept-a-payment), [SEPA\nDirect Debit](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sepa-debit/accept-a-payment),\n[SOFORT](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sofort/accept-a-payment), and [ACH\nDirect\nDebit](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ach-direct-debit/accept-a-payment).\n\n![Screenshot of the invoice PDF that customers can download from the invoice\nsummary\nemail](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/invoice.9e44668032383601eeec362f38293b7a.png)\n\nThe downloadable invoice PDF\n\n![Screenshot of the invoice receipt that customers can download from the invoice\nsummary\nemail](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/invoice_receipt.4f120ee7363f8e7728fa553a8a24aae3.png)\n\nThe downloadable invoice receipt\n\n![Screenshot of the invoice summary email Stripe\nsends](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/email.560c2666905531b907f7fcd4f1a0a6dd.png)\n\nThe customer email with links to the invoice PDF and receipt\n\nYou can also view the invoice in the\n[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/invoices) or access it programmatically\nby listening to the\n[invoice.paid](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-invoice.paid)\nevent through an [event\ndestination](https://docs.stripe.com/event-destinations).\n\nYou can use the `invoice_data` hash inside `invoice_creation` to further\ncustomize the invoice generated by the Checkout Session.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/checkout/sessions \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d mode=payment \\\n -d \"invoice_creation[enabled]\"=true \\\n -d \"invoice_creation[invoice_data][description]\"=\"Invoice for Product X\" \\\n -d \"invoice_creation[invoice_data][metadata][order]\"=order-xyz \\\n -d \"invoice_creation[invoice_data][account_tax_ids][0]\"=DE123456789 \\\n -d \"invoice_creation[invoice_data][custom_fields][0][name]\"=\"Purchase Order\" \\\n -d \"invoice_creation[invoice_data][custom_fields][0][value]\"=PO-XYZ \\\n-d\n\"invoice_creation[invoice_data][rendering_options][amount_tax_display]\"=include_inclusive_tax\n\\\n -d \"invoice_creation[invoice_data][footer]\"=\"B2B Inc.\" \\\n -d \"line_items[0][price]\"={{ONE_TIME_PRICE_ID}} \\\n -d \"line_items[0][quantity]\"=1 \\\n --data-urlencode success_url=\"https://example.com\" \\\n --data-urlencode cancel_url=\"https://example.com\"\n```\n\nReview [invoice best practices](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/customize) for\nyour region to make sure you’re collecting the right information from your\ncustomers. Information like the customer’s billing and shipping addresses, phone\nnumber and tax ID appear on the resulting invoice.\n\n## Localization\n\nWhen using Checkout Sessions, the language of the receipt and invoice is\ndetermined by several factors:\n\n- If a Customer is set, their [preferred\nlocale](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-preferred_locales)\nare used if available.\n- If a Customer is set without any preferred locales, the [language\nsetting](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/emails) from the Stripe Dashboard\nis applied.\n- If no Customer is set, the language defaults to the browser locale of the user\nopening the Checkout Session URL.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Send customer emails](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/send-email)\n- [Automate customer\nemails](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/revenue-recovery/customer-emails)\n\n## Links\n\n- [receipts for payments](https://docs.stripe.com/receipts)\n- [Customer emails settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/emails)\n- [Branding settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding)\n- [Public details settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public)\n-\n[payment_intent_data.description](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-payment_intent_data-description)\n- [Checkout Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object)\n- [update the Charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/update)\n- [Checkout Sessions API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions)\n- [Invoicing](https://stripe.com/invoicing)\n- [this support\narticle](https://support.stripe.com/questions/pricing-for-post-payment-invoices-for-one-time-purchases-via-checkout-and-payment-links)\n-\n[invoice_creation[enabled]](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-invoice_creation-enabled)\n- [Bacs Direct\nDebit](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bacs-debit/accept-a-payment)\n- [Bank\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bank-transfers/accept-a-payment)\n- [Boleto](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/boleto/accept-a-payment)\n- [Canadian pre-authorized\ndebits](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/acss-debit/accept-a-payment)\n- [Konbini](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/konbini/accept-a-payment)\n- [OXXO](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/oxxo/accept-a-payment)\n- [Pay by Bank](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/pay-by-bank/accept-a-payment)\n- [SEPA Direct\nDebit](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sepa-debit/accept-a-payment)\n- [SOFORT](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sofort/accept-a-payment)\n- [ACH Direct\nDebit](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ach-direct-debit/accept-a-payment)\n- [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/invoices)\n-\n[invoice.paid](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-invoice.paid)\n- [event destination](https://docs.stripe.com/event-destinations)\n- [invoice best practices](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/customize)\n- [preferred\nlocale](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-preferred_locales)\n- [Send customer emails](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/send-email)\n- [Automate customer\nemails](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/revenue-recovery/customer-emails)",
