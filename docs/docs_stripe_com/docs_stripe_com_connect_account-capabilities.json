  "content": "# Account capabilities\n\n## Learn about capabilities you can enable for accounts and the requirements you must satisfy to use them.\n\nThe capabilities you request for a connected account determine the information\nyou need to collect for that account. To reduce onboarding effort, only request\nthe capabilities you need. The more capabilities you request, the more\ninformation you must collect.\n\nYou can start by completing the [platform\nprofile](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/profile) to understand which\ncapabilities might be appropriate for your platform.\n\n#### Note\n\nFor some capabilities, requesting them enables them permanently. Attempting to\nremove or unrequest a permanent capability returns an error.\n\nAfter creating an account, you can request additional capabilities and remove\nexisting non-permanent capabilities. For connected accounts that [other\nplatforms\ncontrol](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/platform-controls-for-stripe-dashboard-accounts),\nyou can’t unrequest capabilities.\n\n## Supported capabilities\n\nFollowing is a list of available capabilities. Click an item to expand or\ncollapse it.\n\n### Transfers\n\n### Card payments\n\n### US tax reporting\n\n### Payment methods\n\n### India international payments\n\n## Multiple capabilities\n\nRequesting multiple capabilities for a connected account is common, but involves\nthe following considerations:\n\n- Capabilities operate independently of each other.\n- If a connected account has both `card_payments` and `transfers`, and the\n`status` of either one is `inactive`, then both capabilities are disabled.\n- You can request or unrequest a capability for a connected account at any time\nduring the account’s lifecycle.\n\nCapabilities also allow you to collect information for multiple purposes at the\nsame time. For example, you can collect both required tax information and the\ninformation required for a requested capability. If you’re onboarding a\nconnected account with the `transfers` capability and they’re required to file\nan IRS form 1099-MISC (a US federal tax reporting form), you can collect\ninformation for both at the same time.\n\n## Create an account with capabilities\n\nCapabilities are set on the\n[Account](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object) object. To get the list\nof available capabilities for an Account, use the\n[list_capabilities](https://docs.stripe.com/api/capabilities/list?lang=curl)\nendpoint.\n\nAccount creation and requesting capabilities differ for connected accounts in\ndifferent configurations.\n\n- For connected accounts with access to the full Stripe Dashboard, including\nStandard accounts, some capabilities are requested automatically, based on their\ncountry. You can also request other capabilities for them.\n- For connected accounts with access to the Express Dashboard, including Express\naccounts, you can either request their capabilities or use the [onboarding\nconfiguration\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/onboarding-options/countries)\nto automate capability requests.\n- For connected accounts without access to a Stripe-hosted dashboard, including\nCustom accounts, you must request their capabilities.\nTyped AccountsController properties\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d \"controller[fees][payer]\"=application \\\n -d \"controller[losses][payments]\"=application \\\n -d \"controller[stripe_dashboard][type]\"=none \\\n -d \"controller[requirement_collection]\"=application \\\n -d country=US \\\n -d \"capabilities[card_payments][requested]\"=true \\\n -d \"capabilities[transfers][requested]\"=true\n```\n\nInformation requirements vary depending on the capability, but they often relate\nto identity verification or other information specific to a payment type.\n\nWhen your connected account is successfully created, you can [retrieve a\nlist](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/retrieve) of its requirements:\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts/{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}} \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\"\n```\n\nIn the response, the `requirements` hash specifies the required information. The\nvalues for `payouts_enabled` and `charges_enabled` indicate whether payouts and\ncharges are enabled for the account.\n\n## Capabilities for existing connected accounts\n\nThe following sections describe how to preview information requirements or\nmanage capabilities for existing connected accounts using the [Capabilities\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api/capabilities).\n\n### Preview information requirements\n\nYou can preview what information is needed from your connected account for a\nparticular capability either before or after that capability has been requested.\n\nWhen you request capabilities, `account.updated`\n[webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) fire and the account’s requirements\ncan change. To enable a requirement faster and avoid disabling the account,\npreview the requirements and collect any required information before requesting\nthe capability.\n\nThe following example [lists](https://docs.stripe.com/api/capabilities/retrieve)\nthe requirements for the `card_payments` capability for a specific account.\n\n```\ncurl\nhttps://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts/{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}/capabilities/card_payments\n\\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\"\n```\n\nIn the response, check the `requirements` hash to see what information is\nneeded:\n\n```\n{\n \"id\": \"card_payments\",\n \"object\": \"capability\",\n \"account\": \"{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}\",\n \"requested\": false,\n \"requested_at\": null,\n \"requirements\": {\n \"past_due\": [],\n \"currently_due\": [\"company.tax_id\", ...],\n \"eventually_due\": [...],\n \"disabled_reason\": ...,\n \"current_deadline\": ...,\n },\n \"status\": \"unrequested\"\n}\n```\n\nThe value for `status` identifies whether the capability has been requested.\nWhen the value is\n[requested](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities#requesting-unrequesting),\nthe account’s requirements are active.\n\nIn addition to previewing a capability’s requirements before requesting it, you\ncan use the same endpoint to view a capability’s current requirements. That can\nhelp you stay informed when requirements change.\n\n### Request and unrequest capabilities\n\nTo request a capability for an account, set the capability’s `requested` value\nto `true` by [updating the\naccount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/capabilities/update). If the request\nsucceeds, the API returns `requested: true` in the response.\n\nTo unrequest a capability for an account, set the capability’s `requested` value\nto `false` by [updating the\naccount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/capabilities/update). If the capability\ncan’t be removed, the call returns an error. If the call succeeds, the API\nreturns `requested: false` in the response.\n\nYou can also [request and remove an account’s\ncapabilities](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard/managing-individual-accounts#updating-capabilities)\nfrom the Dashboard. If a capability can’t be removed, its **Remove** button is\ndisabled.\n\nThe example below requests the `transfers` capability for a specific connected\naccount:\n\n```\ncurl\nhttps://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts/{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}/capabilities/transfers\n\\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d requested=true\n```\n\nThe example below requests multiple capabilities for a specific connected\naccount:\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts/{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}} \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d \"capabilities[bancontact_payments][requested]\"=true \\\n -d \"capabilities[eps_payments][requested]\"=true \\\n -d \"capabilities[ideal_payments][requested]\"=true \\\n -d \"capabilities[p24_payments][requested]\"=true \\\n -d \"capabilities[sepa_debit_payments][requested]\"=true\n```\n\n## Deprecated capabilities\n\nCapabilities described in the following sections are deprecated. If possible,\ndon’t request them for new accounts. If you have existing accounts that use\ndeprecated capabilities, we recommend that you update them to use other\ncapabilities instead.\n\n### legacy_payments\n\nThe `legacy_payments` capability enables charges, payouts, and transfers. Newer\naccounts enable those actions using the `card_payments` and `transfers`\ncapabilities, which support more flexible configurations.\n\nWe recommend that you take the following steps:\n\n- Update your connected account onboarding process to request the appropriate\ncombination of `card_payments` and `transfers` instead of `legacy_payments`.\n- Update your existing connected accounts to request the appropriate combination\nof `card_payments` and `transfers`.\n- Update any code that checks the status of `legacy_payments` to check the\nstatus of either `legacy_payments` or the appropriate new capability. For\nexample, update code that relies on an account’s ability to make card payments\nto run when either `legacy_payments` or `card_payments` is active. Similarly,\nupdate code that relies on an account’s ability to accept transfers to run when\neither `legacy_payments` or `transfers` is active. The updated code works\nthroughout the process of transitioning to the new capabilities, regardless of\nwhen the new capabilities become active.\n- After the new capabilities are active for all of your connected accounts,\nremove references to `legacy_payments` from your code.\n\n#### Note\n\nYou can’t unrequest the `legacy_payments` capability. Stripe will notify you in\nadvance before we remove it.\n\nIf you do business in Canada, Stripe automatically requests `card_payments` and\n`transfers` for your accounts that use `legacy_payments`, in order to comply\nwith [updated\nrequirements](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/upcoming-requirements-updates?program=ca-2023).\nDuring the process, you might see the following values in your connected\naccounts’ API responses.\n\nBefore requesting new capabilitiesNew capabilities requestedNew requirements\ncompleted\n```\ncapabilities: {\n legacy_payments: \"active\"\n},\ncharges_enabled: true,\npayouts_enabled: true\n\n```\n\n```\ncapabilities: {\n card_payments: \"inactive\",\n legacy_payments: \"active\",\n transfers: \"inactive\"\n},\ncharges_enabled: true,\npayouts_enabled: true\n\n```\n\n```\ncapabilities: {\n card_payments: \"active\",\n legacy_payments: \"active\",\n transfers: \"active\"\n},\ncharges_enabled: true,\npayouts_enabled: true\n\n```\n\n#### Note\n\nDuring the transition, `card_payments` and `transfers` requirements might appear\nin `past_due`. However, if `legacy_payments` is active, then charges, transfers,\nand payouts remain enabled.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Create a charge](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges)\n\n## Links\n\n- [platform profile](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/profile)\n- [other platforms\ncontrol](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/platform-controls-for-stripe-dashboard-accounts)\n- [Account](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object)\n- [list_capabilities](https://docs.stripe.com/api/capabilities/list?lang=curl)\n- [onboarding configuration\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/onboarding-options/countries)\n- [retrieve a list](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/retrieve)\n- [Capabilities API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/capabilities)\n- [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks)\n- [lists](https://docs.stripe.com/api/capabilities/retrieve)\n- [updating the account](https://docs.stripe.com/api/capabilities/update)\n- [request and remove an account’s\ncapabilities](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard/managing-individual-accounts#updating-capabilities)\n- [updated\nrequirements](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/upcoming-requirements-updates?program=ca-2023)\n- [Create a charge](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges)",
