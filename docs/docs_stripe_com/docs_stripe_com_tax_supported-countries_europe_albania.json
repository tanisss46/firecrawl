In Stripe, these are referred to as “digital products.” To collect\nthis tax on Stripe, you must be a remote seller without a physical presence in\nthe country.\n\n## When to register for tax collection\n\nSee [Thresholds](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/thresholds) to get insights\nabout your potential tax registration obligations in Albania. Stripe also\nnotifies you with email and Dashboard alerts when you need to register to\ncollect tax. Learn more about how the [monitoring tool\nworks](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/monitoring).\n\nRemote sellers providing electronically supplied services (digital products) to\nindividuals in Albania have to register for tax from their first sale there.\nSales to business customers in Albania don’t trigger any tax registration\nobligations because non-resident businesses aren’t required to collect tax on\nthese sales.\n\n- **Threshold**: 1 transaction\n- **Included transactions**: Business-to-consumer (B2C) sales of digital goods\nor electronically supplied services (digital products)\n\n## Register to collect tax\n\nYou must be a remote seller with no physical presence in Albania to collect this\ntax on Stripe.\n\nFind more information on how to register for VAT in Albania on the [government\nwebsite](https://www.tatime.gov.al/eng/c/4/96/110/value-added-tax).\n\nAfter you’ve registered to collect tax in Albania, go to\n[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations?location=al) to\nadd your registrations to Stripe in the Dashboard.
