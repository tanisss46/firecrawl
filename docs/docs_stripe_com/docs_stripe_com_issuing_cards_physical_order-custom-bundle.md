# Order a custom bundle

## Order your custom physical bundle.

After reviewing the [manufactured and
personalized](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/cards/choose-bundle#manufacturing-personalization)
overview, learn the process to make your custom bundle available in the Issuing
Dashboard. Stripe supports you every step of the way when placing a custom
bundle order. We provide all the necessary input forms and design templates for
each phase through email and hold live sessions to explain the requirements and
work through your design ideas.

On average, this process can take 12 to 14 weeks before you can start issuing
cards. This can vary depending on design readiness and complexity. The following
table explains what’s required from you during this process:
