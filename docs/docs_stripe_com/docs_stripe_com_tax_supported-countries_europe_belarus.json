In Stripe, these are referred to as “digital products.” To collect\nthis tax on Stripe, you must be a remote seller without a physical presence in\nthe country.\n\n## When to register for tax collection\n\nSee [Thresholds](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/thresholds) to get insights\nabout your potential tax registration obligations in Belarus. Stripe also\nnotifies you with email and Dashboard alerts when you need to register to\ncollect tax. Learn more about how the [monitoring tool\nworks](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/monitoring).\n\nRemote sellers providing electronically supplied services (digital products) to\nindividuals in Belarus have a registration threshold of EUR 10,000 for the\ncurrent calendar year. Sales to business customers in Belarus don’t trigger any\ntax registration obligations because non-resident businesses aren’t required to\ncollect tax on these sales.\n\n- **Threshold**: EUR 10,000\n- **Timeframe**: Current calendar year\n- **Included transactions**: Business-to-consumer (B2C) sales of digital goods\nor electronically supplied services (digital products)\n\n## Register to collect tax\n\nYou must be a remote seller with no physical presence in Belarus to collect this\ntax on Stripe.\n\nFind more information on how to register for VAT in Belarus on the [government\nwebsite](https://nalog.gov.by/electronic_vat/) (Belarusian content).\n\nAfter you’ve registered to collect tax in Belarus, go to\n[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations?location=by) to\nadd your registrations to Stripe in the Dashboard.

Stripe doesn’t calculate tax for products that don’t use a digital\nproduct tax code.\n\nView the list of supported [digital product tax\ncodes](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes?type=digital). To calculate taxes\nin Belarus, make sure that you [assign a tax\ncode](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/products-prices-tax-codes-tax-behavior#tax-code-on-product)\nto each of your products.\n\n## Report and file your taxes\n\nStripe Tax has filing partners—Taxually, Marosa, and Hands-off Sales Tax\n(HOST)—to help automate your tax filing. These partners automatically sync your\ntax transaction data in real time, eliminating the need for manual data entry or\nfile transfers.
