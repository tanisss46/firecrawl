  "content": "# Tax rates\n\n## Learn how to collect and report taxes with tax rate objects.\n\nStripe allows you to define any number of tax rates and apply them to\n[invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices),\n[subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating), and one\ntime payments when using Checkout. However, we won’t automatically set them on\nyour behalf.\n\nIf you’re looking for automated tax calculation where you don’t need to define\nthe rates, use [Stripe Tax](https://docs.stripe.com/tax).\n\nWhen applying tax rates, Stripe calculates the [total tax\namount](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/taxes/tax-rates#tax-amounts) per tax\nrate, and summarizes it in a table that you can export into tax summary reports.\n\n## Creating tax rates\n\nIf you’re working with a small number of tax rates, you can manage and create\nthem in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/tax-rates). After\ncreating tax rates, you can apply them to\n[invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/taxes/tax-rates),\n[subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/taxes), and [one-time\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/taxes) or\n[subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/taxes/collect-taxes?tax-calculation=tax-rates#adding-tax-rates-to-checkout)\ncreated through Stripe Checkout.\n\nCreate a catalog of tax rates that meet the requirements for the jurisdictions\nthat you do business in. For example, if you operate in Europe, you might want\nto create a catalog of tax rates for OSS VAT.\n\n#### Creating tax rates through the API\n\nThe following example demonstrates how you can create a tax rate through the\nAPI.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/tax_rates \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d display_name=\"Sales Tax\" \\\n -d inclusive=false \\\n -d percentage=\"7.25\" \\\n -d country=US \\\n -d state=CA \\\n -d jurisdiction=\"US - CA\" \\\n -d description=\"CA Sales Tax\"\n```\n\nRequired properties:\n\n- The `display_name` appears on your customer’s invoice, and is usually a short\nname that describes the specific type of tax, such as `Sales`, `VAT`, or `GST`.\n- The `inclusive` property determines whether the tax `percentage` is added to,\nor included in, the overall amount.\n- The `percentage` is a number (up to 4 decimal places) that represents the tax\npercentage to be collected.\n\nOptional properties:\n\n- The optional `country` property is a valid [two-letter ISO country\ncode](https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/country_code_list.htm). Some\ncountries (for example, United States) require an additional two-letter `state`\nproperty. Use these properties to apply dynamic tax rates based on your\ncustomer’s billing or shipping address in Checkout Sessions.\n- The optional `jurisdiction` property represents the tax jurisdiction of the\ntax rate and can be used to differentiate between tax rates of the same\npercentage. `jurisdiction` appears on your customer’s invoice. In the Dashboard,\njurisdiction appears as the *Region* label for the tax rate.\n- You can also store additional details in the `description`. Your customers\nwon’t see this property.\n\nYou can’t change the percentage, country, or state properties after you set\nthem, and you can only set them when you create the tax rate. This ensures that\nexisting subscriptions and invoices using tax rates aren’t affected. If you need\nto update these properties, create a new tax rate and archive the old object.\n\n## Inclusive versus exclusive tax\n\nTax rates can either be exclusive or inclusive. An *exclusive* tax is not\nincluded in the invoice subtotal, whereas an *inclusive* tax is.\n\nThe following table illustrates a 25% tax rate modifying the total amount due,\ndepending on whether it’s exclusive or inclusive.\n\nTaxSubtotalTax dueTotal25% Exclusive$5.00$1.25$6.25 ($5.00 + $1.25)25%\nInclusive$5.00$1.00 (already included in the total)$5.00 ($4.00 + $1.00)\n## Tax exempt and reverse charge\n\nYou can set the exemption status for a\n[Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers) to either exempt or reverse.\n\nIn both cases, no tax is calculated on the invoice.\n\nIn the case where the customer is liable for the tax (that is, under the\nreverse-charge procedure within EU VAT), set the exemption status to `reverse`.\nThe invoice and receipt PDF includes the text **“Reverse charge”**.\n\n[Download example reverse-charge invoice\nPDF](https://d37ugbyn3rpeym.cloudfront.net/docs/files/billing/taxes/example-reverse-charge.pdf)\n\nIf a one time payment is performed using Checkout, the exemption status is\ncaptured as\n[customer_details](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object#checkout_session_object-customer_details)\nin the Checkout Session object.\n\nIf the customer is either exempt or reverse, for invoices with *inclusive* tax\nrates, the buyer pays the `unit_amount` price *minus* the tax that would’ve been\npaid had the user not been exempt or reverse. In other words, manual tax rates\neffectively calculate taxes as if the user weren’t exempt and then “backs out”\nthe taxes.\n\nThe following table illustrates a 10% tax rate modifying the total amount due\nfor an exempt or reverse customer. The first row is an example of “backed out”\ntaxes.\n\nTaxAmountTax dueTotal10% inclusive100$0$90.91 (inclusive tax of $9.09 is\nsubtracted from the price)10% exclusive100$0$100\n## Using multiple tax rates\n\nYou can apply Tax rates to line items or set them as a default for all line\nitems in an invoice. You can set up to five tax rates per line item. When you\nset tax rates on both a line item and the invoice, the rates for that invoice\ndon’t apply to that line item.\n\nFor example, this invoice has two overall tax rates of 9.975% and 5%:\n\nInvoiceItem tax rateOverall invoice tax rateItem tax rate (Effective)Line item\n1(none)9.975% and 5%9.975% and 5%Line item 210%9.975% and 5%10%Line item 31% and\n2%9.975% and 5%1% and 2\n## Tax amounts\n\nWhen you apply tax rates to an invoice, they’re aggregated into the\n[total_tax_amounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-total_tax_amounts)\nattribute. This attribute represents the sum of all tax amounts, per tax rate,\nover the entire invoice.\n\nFor example, here’s an invoice where two line items have two different rates:\n\nInvoiceAmountTax RateTax AmountTotalsLine item 1$5.005% (excl)$0.25—Line item\n2$10.0010% (excl)$1.00—Total Tax Amount——$1.25—Total$15.00——$16.25\n[Download example invoice\nPDF](https://d37ugbyn3rpeym.cloudfront.net/docs/files/billing/taxes/example-tax-amounts.pdf)\n\n## Rounding\n\nWhen determining tax amounts, you can do either of the following:\n\n- Round at the invoice line item level to the [smallest currency\nunit](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#zero-decimal) before summing individual\ntax amounts across the entire invoice. We refer to this as “line item level”.\n- Sum up all individual taxable amounts unrounded per tax rate. Combine them to\na subtotal, apply the tax rate on the subtotal, and then round. We refer to this\nas “invoice level”.\n\nSelect this configuration on the [invoice\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/invoice) page in the\nDashboard. The rounding configuration is only available for invoices with manual\ntax rates. Invoices with automatic Stripe tax always sum up the tax amounts\nfirst and then round.\n\nLine item levelInvoice levelNameAmountInclusive Tax RateTaxable Amount (before\nrounding)Tax Amount (before rounding)Tax Amount (after rounding)Line Item\n1$1000.0010%$909.0909$90.9091$90.91Line Item\n2$50.0010%$45.4545$4.5455$4.55Subtotal$1,050.00————Total Tax\nAmounts————$95.46Total rounded$1,050.00—$954.54—$95.46\n[Download example line item level rounding invoice\nPDF](https://d37ugbyn3rpeym.cloudfront.net/docs/files/billing/taxes/example-line-item-level-rounding.pdf)\n\n## Discounts\n\nDiscounts are usually applied before tax, but this isn’t always the case.\n\nReading each line left-to-right, noting the formula applied (in the table\nheader), you can trace the values as they’re applied to the final, total amount.\n\n### Exclusive tax discount example\n\nStripe always applies discounts before exclusive tax.\n\nThis example shows how we apply discounts to an exclusive tax rate.\n\nInvoice ItemAmountDiscount %Discount $Post DiscountTax RateTax\n$TotalFormula——`Amount * Discount``Amount - Discount$`—`PostDiscount *\nTaxRate``PostDiscount + Tax$`Line item 1$5.0010%$0.50$4.505% exl.$0.23$4.73Line\nitem 2$10.0010%$1.00$9.005% exl.$0.45$9.45Total$15.00$1.50$13.50$0.68 (@ 5%\nexl.)$14.18\n[Download example discounts invoice\nPDF](https://d37ugbyn3rpeym.cloudfront.net/docs/files/billing/taxes/example-exclusive-tax-with-discount.pdf)\n\n### Inclusive tax discount example\n\nWhen tax rates are inclusive, Stripe Tax applies discounts to the original\namount first. Then, we recalculate taxes based on the remaining amount. This\nreduction has the side effect of reducing the tax amount due.\n\nInvoice ItemAmountDiscount %Discount $Post DiscountTax RateTax $\n(Included)TotalFormula——`Amount * Discount%``Amount - Discount$`—`PostDiscount -\nPostDiscount / (1 + TaxRate)``PostDiscount`Line item 1$5.0010%$0.50$4.505%\nincl.$0.21$4.50Line item 2$10.0010%$1.00$9.005%\nincl.$0.43$9.00Total$15.00—$1.50$13.50—$0.64 (@ 5% incl.)$13.50\n[Download example invoice\nPDF](https://d37ugbyn3rpeym.cloudfront.net/docs/files/billing/taxes/example-inclusive-tax-with-discount.pdf)\n\n### Both inclusive and exclusive tax with discount example\n\nIn the case where you have both inclusive and exclusive tax, the two rules apply\ntogether in the following steps for every line item:\n\n- We calculate the inclusive tax amount based on the post-discounted amount by\nmultiplying by the inclusive tax rate.\n- We calculate the exclusive tax amount by multiplying the exclusive tax rate by\nthe post-discounted amount, less the inclusive tax amount.\n- We calculate the total amount due by summing the post-discounted amount and\nthe exclusive tax amount (calculated in step 2).\nInvoice ItemAmountDiscount %Discount $Post DiscountInclusive Tax RateInclusive\nTax $Post Discount, Less Incl.

To factor in any refunds you will also need to pivot\nagainst the Invoice totals export.\n\n## Migrate to tax rates\n\nIf you’re using the deprecated `tax_percent`, `tax_info`,\n`tax_info_verification`, and `business_vat_id` fields, review the following\noptions to migrate to tax rates and [Customer Tax\nIDs](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/tax-ids) for better tax collection\nand reporting (remittance) tools.\n\n### Existing tax percent use cases have been migrated to tax rates\n\nExisting `tax_percent` uses have been automatically converted into [tax\nrates](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_rates), and your invoices and\nsubscriptions have been updated to reference the new objects through\n[default_tax_rates](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create#create_invoice-default_tax_rates).\n\nThis means that if you had previously been setting a `tax_percent` of `15%` on\nyour invoices, Stripe has created a new `15%` tax rate object for you (although\nit lacks details such as a customer facing display name or a jurisdiction). If\nyou continue to set the `tax_percent` to `15%`, Stripe dynamically creates a 15%\ntax rate for you to aid your migration. This works exactly as it had before.\n\nYou can manage your full list of tax rates in the Dashboard’s [tax\nrates](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax-rates) page.\n\n### Migration options\n\nFor new invoices or subscriptions, we recommend performing the\n[full](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/taxes/tax-rates#full) update to use tax\nrates.\n\n#### No action\n\nIf you take no action, your integration continues to work as it does today. As\nmentioned above, existing uses of `tax_percent` are made to look as if they used\ntax rates.\n\nAs your tax rates lack a\n[display_name](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_rates/object#tax_rate_object-display_name)\nand\n[jurisdiction](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_rates/object#tax_rate_object-jurisdiction),\ntax reporting might not be very useful. Invoices and receipts render a generic\nname for these rates—“Tax”.\n\n#### Minimal update with medium benefits\n\nUse the Dashboard to edit pre-existing tax rates so taxes work for pre-existing\ninvoices.\n\n- For tax rates that have been migrated for you, edit the\n[display_name](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_rates/object#tax_rate_object-display_name)\nto have a useful user-facing name. Display names are displayed to your customers\non generated invoices and receipts (for example, “UST” for German VAT and “HST”\nfor Ontario’s Harmonized Sales Tax).\n- Set the\n[jurisdiction](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_rates/object#tax_rate_object-jurisdiction)\nto store an associated tax jurisdiction (for example, “DE” for Germany or “NL\nAmsterdam” for the city of Amsterdam).\n\nInvoices and receipts show the `display_name` of tax rates. When determining how\nmuch tax to remit, you can group by jurisdiction.\n\n#### Full update and benefits\n\nWe no longer recommend using the `tax_percent` field for new invoices, and to\nuse tax rates instead. Apply tax rates to\n[invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/taxes/tax-rates) and\n[subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/taxes). This allows you to add\nmultiple tax rates per line item and invoice, display the correct name for tax\nrates and summaries on generated invoices and receipts, and improved tax\nreporting.\n\n### Customer Tax IDs\n\nThe Customer’s `tax_info`, `tax_info_verification`, and `business_vat_id` fields\nare deprecated in favor of [Customer Tax\nIDs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-tax_ids). The\n[Tax ID](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_tax_ids) object provides:\n\n- Multiple tax IDs on a Customer.\n- Support for more tax ID types, such as EU VAT, NZ GST, and AU ABN.\n- Automatic validation of EU VAT numbers against the [European Commission’s VAT\nInformation Exchange System (VIES)](http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/)\ndatabase.\n- Automatic validation of Australian Business Numbers (ABNs) against the\n[Australian Business Register (ABR)](https://abr.gov.au/).\n- Associate a country with a tax ID (for example, a German EU VAT number).\n\nSee [Customer Tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/tax-ids) for\nmore information.\n\n## Links\n\n- [invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n- [subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating)\n- [Stripe Tax](https://docs.stripe.com/tax)\n- [total tax\namount](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/taxes/tax-rates#tax-amounts)\n- [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/tax-rates)\n- [invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/taxes/tax-rates)\n- [subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/taxes)\n- [one-time payments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/taxes)\n-\n[subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/taxes/collect-taxes?tax-calculation=tax-rates#adding-tax-rates-to-checkout)\n- [two-letter ISO country\ncode](https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/country_code_list.htm)\n- [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers)\n- [Download example reverse-charge invoice\nPDF](https://d37ugbyn3rpeym.cloudfront.net/docs/files/billing/taxes/example-reverse-charge.pdf)\n-\n[customer_details](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object#checkout_session_object-customer_details)\n-\n[total_tax_amounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-total_tax_amounts)\n- [Download example invoice\nPDF](https://d37ugbyn3rpeym.cloudfront.net/docs/files/billing/taxes/example-tax-amounts.pdf)\n- [smallest currency unit](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#zero-decimal)\n- [invoice settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/invoice)\n- [Download example line item level rounding invoice\nPDF](https://d37ugbyn3rpeym.cloudfront.net/docs/files/billing/taxes/example-line-item-level-rounding.pdf)\n- [Download example discounts invoice\nPDF](https://d37ugbyn3rpeym.cloudfront.net/docs/files/billing/taxes/example-exclusive-tax-with-discount.pdf)\n- [Download example invoice\nPDF](https://d37ugbyn3rpeym.cloudfront.net/docs/files/billing/taxes/example-inclusive-tax-with-discount.pdf)\n- [Download example invoice\nPDF](https://d37ugbyn3rpeym.cloudfront.net/docs/files/billing/taxes/example-inclusive-and-exclusive-tax-with-discount.pdf)\n- [Tax reporting and filing](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports)\n- [Tax Rates list](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/tax-rates/)\n- [Customer Tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/tax-ids)\n- [tax rates](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_rates)\n-\n[default_tax_rates](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create#create_invoice-default_tax_rates)\n- [tax rates](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax-rates)\n-\n[display_name](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_rates/object#tax_rate_object-display_name)\n-\n[jurisdiction](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_rates/object#tax_rate_object-jurisdiction)\n- [Customer Tax\nIDs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-tax_ids)\n- [Tax ID](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_tax_ids)\n- [European Commission’s VAT Information Exchange System\n(VIES)](http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/)\n- [Australian Business Register (ABR)](https://abr.gov.au/)",
