  "content": "# Credit note examples\n\n## Learn about revenue recognition with credit note examples.\n\nUnless stated otherwise, these credit note examples assume that revenue\nrecognition takes place on a per-day basis.\n\n## Credit note before a payment\n\nA pre-paid credit note is issued before the customer makes a payment or before\nthe invoice is fully paid. It is used to adjust the amount the customer owes or\nto provide a discount upfront. Here’s an example:\n\nIn this example, a customer starts a subscription for a 3 month period on\nJanuary 1 at 00:00:00 UTC that costs 120 USD. Before a payment is received, you\noffer a pre-payment credit note of 30 USD that is applied to the customer\nbalance. This is treated like an upfront discount and reduces your overall\ninvoice to 90 USD. The invoice is then paid in February for 90 USD. Your summary\nfor March would look something like this:\n\nAccountStartingJan 2024Feb 2024Mar\n2024EndingAccountsReceivable0.00+90.00-90.000.00Cash0.00+90.0090.00Revenue0.00+31.00+28.00+31.0090.00DeferredRevenue0.00+59.00-28.00-31.000.00\n## Credit note after a payment\n\nYou can use a refund, a customer credit, or an out-of-band credit to issue a\ncredit note to a customer after they’ve made a payment.\n\nIn this example, a customer starts a subscription for a 3 month period on\nJanuary 1 at 00:00:00 UTC that costs 90 USD. The subscription generates an\ninvoice and the customer pays it immediately. On February 1, you issue a credit\nnote of 45 USD where you: refund 15 USD; credit 10 USD to the customer balance;\nand credit 20 USD to an external customer balance (an out-of-band credit). Your\nsummary for March would like something like this:\n\nAccountJan 2024Feb 2024Mar\n2024Cash+90.00-15.00Revenue+31.00+14.00+15.50DeferredRevenue+59.00-43.50-15.50Refunds+5.10CreditNotes+10.40CustomerBalance+10.00ExternalCustomerBalance+20.00\n## Credit note without line items\n\nThis example uses the following assumptions:\n\n- On January 1 at 00:00:00 UTC, a customer starts a 6 month subscription that\ncosts 181 USD.\n- The subscription generates an invoice.\n- The invoice finalizes, but the customer has not paid yet.\n- On February 1, you issue a credit note of 90.50 USD.\n\nWhen the credit note is issued:\n\n- The accounts receivable account is reduced according to the credit note’s\namount.\n- Recognized revenue is offset by contra revenue proportionally in the credit\nnotes account.\n- Deferred revenue from the subscription that hasn’t been recognized is reduced\nproportionally to the credit note amount.\n\nIf you viewed the summary after March ends, it might look something like this:\n\nAccountStartingJan 2024Feb 2024Mar 2024Ending Mar\n2024AccountsReceivable0.00+181.00-90.5090.50Revenue0.00+31.00+14.00+15.5060.50DeferredRevenue0.00+150.00-89.00-15.500.00CreditNotes0.00+15.5015.50\nWhen the credit note is voided on May 3:\n\n- Reverses the credit notes account.\n- Increases accounts receivable back to the original invoice due amount.\n- Recognizes the reduced revenue in May instead of February, March, and April.\n- Reinstates the reduced deferred revenue in May.\n\nThe summary after June end might look something like:\n\nAccountStartingJan 2024Feb 2024Mar 2024Apr 2024May 2024Jun\n2024EndingAccountsReceivable0.00+181.00-90.50+90.50181.00Revenue0.00+31.00+14.00+15.50+15.00+75.50+30.00181.00DeferredRevenue0.00+150.00-89.00-15.50-15.00-0.50-30.000.00CreditNotes0.00+15.50-15.5015.50\nA credit note without line items doesn’t match with a specific invoice line\nitem. Rather, the amount of the credit note is divided proportionally among the\ninvoice line items.\n\n## Credit note with line items\n\nA credit note with line items works similarly to a [credit note without line\nitems](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/examples/credit-notes#credit-note-without-line-items),\nexcept that a credit note line item is used for adjusting the revenue and other\naccounts for a corresponding invoice line item.\n\n## Credit note with negative line items\n\nAdjustments to accounts for a credit note with negative line items are the\nreverse of those for a credit note with positive line items.\n\nLearn how to [credit negative invoice line items in the\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/dashboard/credit-notes#negative-line-items)\nor [programmatically with the\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/programmatic-credit-notes#negative-line-items).\n\n## Links\n\n- [credit negative invoice line items in the\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/dashboard/credit-notes#negative-line-items)\n- [programmatically with the\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/programmatic-credit-notes#negative-line-items)",
