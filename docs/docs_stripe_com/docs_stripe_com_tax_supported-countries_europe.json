Stripe also supports tax calculation in all of\nthe countries in the European Union (EU). Learn more about [tax support for the\nEuropean Union](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/european-union).\n\nClick the links below to learn about the thresholds in each country and the\ntypes of goods and services we support.\n\n- [Albania](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/europe/albania)\n- [Belarus](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/europe/belarus)\n- [Bosnia and\nHerzegovina](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/europe/bosnia-and-herzegovina)\n- [Iceland](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/europe/iceland)\n- [Moldova](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/europe/moldova)\n-\n[Montenegro](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/europe/montenegro)\n- [North\nMacedonia](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/europe/north-macedonia)\n- [Norway](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/europe/norway)\n- [Russia](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/europe/russia)\n- [Serbia](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/europe/serbia)\n-\n[Switzerland](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/europe/switzerland)\n- [Ukraine](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/europe/ukraine)\n- [United\nKingdom](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/europe/united-kingdom)\n\n## When and how to register for tax collection\n\nDifferent rules determine when and how you need to register to collect tax\ndepending on the country. Click the links above to learn about the thresholds\nfor tax collection in each location.\n\nSee [Thresholds](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/thresholds) to get insights\nabout your potential tax registration obligations in each location. Stripe only\nmonitors if you have reached a tax threshold for sales outside of the country\nyour business is based in. Stripe also notifies you with email and Dashboard\nalerts when you need to register to collect tax. Learn more about how the\n[monitoring tool works](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/monitoring).\n\nIn Albania, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Iceland, Moldova, Montenegro, North\nMacedonia, Russia, Serbia, and Ukraine your business needs to be a remote seller\nwith no physical presence (such as a shop or warehouse) to collect tax on\nStripe.\n\nAfter you’ve registered with a country, go to\n[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations) to add your\nregistrations to Stripe in the Dashboard to start collecting tax on your\ntransactions in that location.\n\n## How we calculate taxes\n\nWhat you sell and where you sell impacts how tax is calculated on your sales.\nThere are also different rules that apply when your customer is located in the\nsame country as your business or located somewhere else. Stripe can calculate\ntax for [any of the product tax codes you assign to your\nproducts](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes) and for domestic and\ncross-border sales in Norway, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. For the other\ncountries listed, Stripe only supports calculation for [digital\nproducts](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes?type=digital) sold by remote\nsellers.\n\n### Domestic transactions\n\nA transaction where your business and your customer are in the same country is\ncalled a domestic transaction. Stripe assumes the sale of most goods or services\nto be taxable unless the tax authority has specifically made them exempt. In\nthis region, Stripe only supports calculation for domestic transactions in\nNorway, Switzerland, United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom.\n\n### Cross border transactions\n\nA cross-border transaction is where your customer is located in a different\ncountry to your business or when goods are shipped from one country to another.\n\nStripe calculates tax on a cross-border transaction taking into account the\nfollowing factors:\n\n- the location of your business\n- the tax registrations you’ve added to Stripe\n- the location of the buyer\n- the type of the product sold (based on which [product tax\ncode](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes) you assigned to your product)\n- the status of the customer (whether they’re an individual or a business)\n\n#### Digital products\n\nDigital products are non-physical items or services that are delivered, given,\nor rendered electronically. This includes digital goods and electronically\nsupplied services. We determine whether you’re selling digital products or\nphysical goods using the [product tax\ncode](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes) you assigned to your product.\n\nDigital products are generally taxable in the country where your customer is\nlocated. However sales of digital products to businesses in other countries\nmight have reverse charge applied. With reverse charge, your business provides\nan invoice for the purchase so that your customer can calculate the tax.\n\n#### Physical goods\n\nWhen physical goods are shipped to a customer in a different country to your\nbusiness, the transaction is referred to as an export. Exports are zero rated\nand Stripe applies the [zero rate](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/zero-tax). The\ntransaction might still be subject to taxes and customs duties in the country\nyour customer is in. Stripe doesn’t calculate these.\n\nIn Saudi Arabia and Türkiye, Stripe only supports calculation for [digital\nproducts](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes?type=digital) and not physical\ngoods.\n\nStripe Tax has filing partners—Taxually, Marosa, and Hands-off Sales Tax\n(HOST)—to help automate your tax filing. These partners automatically sync your\ntax transaction data in real time, eliminating the need for manual data entry or\nfile transfers. Learn more about [tax\nfiling](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/filing).\n\nStripe also provides reports of your completed tax transactions. Go to\n[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations) to access these\nreports. Learn more about [the different types of\nreports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports).\n\n## Links\n\n- [tax support for the European\nUnion](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/european-union)\n- [Albania](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/europe/albania)\n- [Belarus](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/europe/belarus)\n- [Bosnia and\nHerzegovina](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/europe/bosnia-and-herzegovina)\n- [Iceland](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/europe/iceland)\n- [Moldova](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/europe/moldova)\n-\n[Montenegro](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/europe/montenegro)\n- [North\nMacedonia](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/europe/north-macedonia)\n- [Norway](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/europe/norway)\n- [Russia](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/europe/russia)\n- [Serbia](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/europe/serbia)\n-\n[Switzerland](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/europe/switzerland)\n- [Ukraine](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/europe/ukraine)\n- [United\nKingdom](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/europe/united-kingdom)\n- [Thresholds](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/thresholds)\n- [monitoring tool works](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/monitoring)\n- [Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations)\n- [any of the product tax codes you assign to your\nproducts](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes)\n- [digital products](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes?type=digital)\n- [zero rate](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/zero-tax)\n- [tax filing](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/filing)\n- [the different types of reports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports)",
