# Action buttons for Stripe Apps

## Learn where to add action buttons in your Stripe app.

Keep action buttons in a consistent place.

## Before you begin

[Create an app](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/create-app).

## Suggested use

- Place action buttons in the header to make sure they’re visible to users, even
when content flows off-screen.
- When content areas don’t require a scroll bar, place buttons below the
content. For example:

![Action buttons in the header actions
