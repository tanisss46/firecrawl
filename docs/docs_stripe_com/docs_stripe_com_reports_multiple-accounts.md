# Reports for multiple accountsPublic preview

## Access consolidated reports for multiple accounts that belong to your organization.

You can review and download reports for your
[organization](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/orgs), including a
consolidated report for all accounts in an organization. You can also get single
reports for specific accounts. To get started, first [select a
report](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/select-a-report), then view or download
the consolidated report. To access reports, you must have a
[role](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/teams/roles) with the right
permissions.

## View consolidated reports

To view the totals for each report, click **Account selector** in the report,
then select the accounts. You can also use the account-level
[controls](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/options).

### Settlement currency

The reports sum the data from the selected accounts and display the data for
each account using the account’s settlement currency. If there are multiple
currencies, use the [currency](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/options#currency)
toggle to select one.

### Reporting categories

The [reporting categories](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/reporting-categories)
are the same as those available for individual accounts. The reports sum the
data using the selected settlement currency cumulatively across the accounts.

## Download consolidated reports

To download a consolidated report, you must have a
[role](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/teams/roles) with permission
to download the given reports in each of the accounts, such as Analyst. You can
download consolidated [Balance](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/balance) and
[Reconcilliation](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/payout-reconciliation)
reports.

To download a consolidated report for multiple accounts in your organization:

- In the Stripe Dashboard, go to the **Reports** tab and select a report.
- Select the configuration options for the report, like required date range,
timezone, and the accounts to include in the report.
- Click **Download**.
- In the modal, select the format for the report:- **Aggregated report**: Data
of selected accounts summed at an organization level.
- **Single report**: Data of selected accounts concatenated into a single
report.
- **Individual reports**: Zip file containing separate reports of selected
accounts.
- Click **Download**.

## File size limits

When you download reports, there’s a 10 GB limit for each individual account
report and a 15 GB limit for consolidated reports with multiple accounts. If you
exceed the file download limit, reduce the size of a report by configuring
[filters](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/options), such as **Date** and
**Currency**.
