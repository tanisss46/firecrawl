The BIN represents both the card network and the bank that\nissues the card. A BIN is licensed for you when you create your program. Most\nusers have one BIN per Issuing setup.\n\nAccount ranges are the digits that immediately follow the BIN on a card number.\nFor 6-digit BINs, these are the seventh to ninth digits on a card. For 8-digit\nBINs, the account range is the ninth digit on a card. BINs work together with\naccount ranges to help acquirers identify the card issuer. Set up your Issuing\nprogram on either a shared BIN or a dedicated BIN:\n\n- **Shared BIN**: Your BIN is shared with other card network users. This is the\ndefault and recommended option for most users because it’s the simplest and\nleast costly to enable. A user on a shared BIN might have a unique account range\nto help acquirers identify authorizations coming from that user.\n- **Dedicated BIN** Beta: The entire BIN is only associated with your accounts.\n\n## Card product type\n\n*Card product type* is a setting that affects the features available to you and\nyour cardholders through Stripe Issuing. We recommend selecting a card product\ntype based on the size of your business and what you purchase with the cards.\n\n#### Note\n\n*Card product type* differs from *card type*. *Card type* usually indicates a\ndifferent aspect of the card, such as whether it’s a credit or debit card.\n\nStripe offers four primary card product types:\n\nTypeDescriptionBest forVisa BusinessHelps small businesses and organizations\nseparate business and personal expenses. This allows your business to better\nmanage cash flow. This includes business tooling like receipt capture and\naccounting software integrations.Small businesses with <100 employees—or\nplatforms who serve them—who want to manage their business expenses.Visa\nBusiness SignatureSame as Visa Business, with extra perks and benefits.Designed\nfor Small businesses to optimize their cash flow and earn rewards for their\nbusiness. Ideal for businesses that seek rewards and protection\nbenefits.Commercial Corporate cardHelps employees pay their travel and\nentertainment (T&E) expenses securely. Your company has access to granular\ninformation to effectively manage spending.Mid-size businesses to large\nenterprises (100+ employees)—or platforms who serve them—who primarily need to\nmanage spend on travel and entertainment expenses.Commercial Fleet cardProvides\npayment solutions to manage all expenses generated by a vehicle fleet operation,\nincluding fuel, maintenance and repairs.Mid-size to large enterprises (100+\nemployees)—or platforms who serve them—who manage fleet expenses.Commercial\nPurchasing cardExpedites the procurement process and saves cost by eliminating\nthe need to issue purchase orders for procurement, invoices, and checks.Mid-size\nto large enterprises (100+ employees)—or platforms who serve them—with use cases\nthat don’t fit into Commercial Corporate or Commercial Fleet.\nThe card product type you choose affects the type of data you receive for each\ntransaction.\n\nFor example:\n\nA user with a *Commercial Fleet card* receives specific fleet-related data for\ntransactions, such as:\n\n- Number of gallons pumped\n- Type of fuel pumped\n- Odometer readings\n- Itemized fuel and non-fuel purchases\n\nA user with a *Commercial Corporate card* receives specific travel and\nentertainment-related data for transactions, such as:\n\n- Flight carrier\n- Flight departure time\n- Airport code\n- Hotel check-in date\n- Number of nights in a hotel stay\n\nA user with a *Commercial Purchasing card* receives invoice-specific data for\ntransactions, such as:\n\n- Number of items purchased\n- Quantity of each item\n\nSet up multiple card product types on Stripe if more than one card product type\nis relevant for your business. You can’t use multiple card product types if you\nset up a Business card.\n\n## Network preference\n\nStripe supports both the Mastercard and Visa card networks. When you onboard to\nIssuing, you decide which card network to issue cards with, and it’s considered\nyour default network. To change your default network at any time, see [Stripe\nSupport](https://support.stripe.com/topics/issuing) for more details.\n\n### Multi-network issuing Beta\n\nWe now offer the option to issue cards on both Mastercard and Visa. With this\nfunctionality, you can issue cards on both networks simultaneously.\n\nIssuing cards on both Mastercard and Visa is limited to preview users. You must\nbe an Issuing customer to join the preview. To request access to the preview,\nvisit [Stripe support](https://support.stripe.com/) and contact the support\nteam.\n\n## Funding types\n\nWhen setting up your Issuing program, you need to choose how you want to fund\nthe cards. Choose your funding type based on your card product type and what\nbest suits your liquidity options. Stripe offers two options that support a\nvariety of business needs:\n\nFunding optionDetailsBest forPrepaidCard balances are pre-funded into an account\nthat’s reloaded by the platform (in case of a direct integration), or by a\nconnected account, as often as necessary.Pre-loading balances without an\nattached checking account.CreditCard balances are linked to an external credit\naccount.Pre-loading balances with an attached external credit account.\nFunding options vary depending on the [card product\ntype](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/customize-your-program#card-product-type)\nyou select.\n\nCard product typeFunding optionsVisa BusinessPrepaid, CreditVisa Business\nSignaturePrepaid, CreditCommercial CorporatePrepaid, CreditCommercial\nFleetCredit onlyCommercial PurchasingPrepaid, Credit\n## Card benefits and rewards\n\n### Card benefits\n\nAll cards issued through Stripe have a roster of available cardholder benefits.\nBy default, your cardholders receive automatically-included benefits that vary\ndepending on the card product type of your program.

Our card network provider must review and\napprove all marketing materials or cardholder-facing terms before publishing. We\nwork with you during the approval process by supplying you with sample,\npre-approved messaging if you don’t draft your own. This is a required step to\nlaunching a benefits program. The review process can take 5-7 business days.\n\n### Rewards\n\nAlthough Stripe doesn’t provide rewards on any of its issued cards, you can set\nup your own rewards program on any of the cards you issue through us. Of the\ncard product types Stripe offers, rewards are only a requirement for Visa\nBusiness Signature. The only requirement before going live is to make sure that\nour card network partner has reviewed and signed off on the reward terms and\npromotion details.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Issuing Dashboard\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/issuing/card-programs)\n- [Stripe Support](https://support.stripe.com/topics/issuing)\n- [Stripe support](https://support.stripe.com/)\n- [card product\ntype](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/customize-your-program#card-product-type)\n- [Optional\nbenefits](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/customize-your-program#optional-benefits)\n- [Visa\nBusiness](https://usa.visa.com/support/small-business/card-benefits.html#1)\n- [Visa\nSavingsEdge](https://www.visasavingsedge.com/e/members/registration.php?sid=92XXdKrlo92#step1)\n- [Visa Business\nSignature](https://usa.visa.com/support/small-business/card-benefits.html#2)\n-\n[Commercial](https://usa.visa.com/run-your-business/commercial-solutions/enterprise-government-cards/commercial-card-enterprise-government.html#2)",
