# Stripe data

## Use Stripe data to gauge business performance.

Use the data from Stripe to understand your business. These analytics and
reporting tools can help you analyze transaction patterns, monitor business
growth, identify customer behavior trends, and generate tailored financial
reports. You can use:

- [Sigma](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data/access-data-in-dashboard) to
create queries and run custom reports from the Stripe Dashboard.
- [Data Pipeline](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data/access-data-in-warehouse)
to sync Stripe data to your data warehouse.
- [Data management](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data/import-external-data) to
import external data into Stripe.
