# Configuring a person as an account opener no longer automatically sets them as an executiveBreaking changes

## What’s new

The `relationship[executive]` field on a `Person` object is no longer
automatically set to `true` when you create a `Person` object with
`relationship[account_opener]`. The `requirements` hash on an `Account` object
might require that you explicitly indicate that the `account_opener` is also an
`executive`. If this is the case, you need to indicate it by setting
`relationship[executive]=true`.

## Impact

This change removes the automatic setting of `relationship[executive]` to `true`
when creating a `Person` object with `relationship[account_opener]`. You now
need to explicitly set `relationship[executive]=true` if required by the
account’s `requirements` hash. This modification provides more precise control
over person relationships in account management.
