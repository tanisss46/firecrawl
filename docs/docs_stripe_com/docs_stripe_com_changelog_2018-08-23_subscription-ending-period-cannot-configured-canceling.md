# A subscription's ending period can no longer be configured while canceling itBreaking changes

## What’s new

Going forward, the `DELETE` endpoint is reserved for immediate canceling. You
can no longer set `at_period_end` in the subscription `DELETE` endpoints. Use
`cancel_at_period_end` on the subscription update endpoints instead.

## Impact

This change enforces stricter validation on the `email` parameter when creating
or updating customer records, ensuring it contains a properly formatted email
address. You’re now required to provide valid email addresses, improving data
quality and reducing errors in customer communications.
