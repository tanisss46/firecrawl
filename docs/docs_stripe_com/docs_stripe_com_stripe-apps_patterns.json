Think of them as a\ncombination of components—for example, combining the **Spinner** and other\nindividual components to create a **Loading screen**. As we establish new\npatterns, we’ll add guidance to this section. Follow these patterns as you\ndesign your app so that it functions in a consistent, clear, and scalable\nmanner.\n\n## Onboarding\n\n[Activation flowProvide users with a sign in or sign up flow
