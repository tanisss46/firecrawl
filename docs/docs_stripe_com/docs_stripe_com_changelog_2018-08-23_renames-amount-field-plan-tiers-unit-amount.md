# Renames the amount field for plan tiers to unit_amountBreaking changes

## What’s new

Renames the `amount` field field in the `tiers` configuration for `plans` to
`unit_amount`.

## Impact

You need to update your code to reference `unit_amount` instead of `amount` when
working with tiered pricing in plans. This modification provides clearer
terminology, reducing confusion between total amounts and per-unit amounts.
