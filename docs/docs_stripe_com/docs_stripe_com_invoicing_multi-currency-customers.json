You can’t have two active subscriptions with different\ncurrencies.\n\nThis guide also explains how to create a credit note and inspect a customer’s\ncredit balance in all assigned currencies. For illustrative purposes, we use the\nCanadian Dollar (CAD).\n\n## Create an invoice\n\nBefore you invoice a customer, create an invoice item by passing in the customer\n`id`, `amount`, and `currency`. Only add invoice items to a single customer at a\ntime to avoid adding them to the wrong one.\n\nThe maximum number of invoice items is 250. Creating an invoice adds up to 250\npending invoice items with the remainder to be added on the next invoice. To see\nyour customer’s pending invoice items, see the **Customer details** page or set\nthe\n[pending](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoiceitems/list#list_invoiceitems-pending)\nattribute to `true` when you use the API to list all of the invoice items.\n\n#### Note\n\nA CAD invoice doesn’t apply a customer credit balance denominated in USD or any\nother currency other than CAD. Additionally, any amount-off coupons you applied\nto the customer that are denominated in non-CAD currency are ignored.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/invoiceitems \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d customer={{CUSTOMER_ID}} \\\n -d amount=1000 \\\n -d currency=cad\n```\n\nYou must pass in the `currency` parameter when you issue a multi-currency\ninvoice. The `currency` parameter dictates which invoice items get pulled into\nthe invoice. For example, if you were to create two invoice items—one in USD and\nthe other in CAD—for the same customer, setting the currency to CAD would only\npull in the CAD invoice item (ignoring the USD invoice item).\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/invoices \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d customer={{CUSTOMER_ID}} \\\n -d collection_method=send_invoice \\\n -d days_until_due=30 \\\n -d pending_invoice_items_behavior=include \\\n -d currency=cad\n```\n\n## Create a credit note\n\nIf there’s an issue with the invoice, you can create a credit note. If you need\nto apply the credit to the customer’s credit balance (as opposed to back to the\noriginal payment method), Stripe allocates the credit amount to the CAD-specific\ncredit balance.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/credit_notes \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d invoice={{INVOICE_ID}} \\\n -d reason=duplicate \\\n -d amount=1000 \\\n -d credit_amount=1000\n```\n\n## Inspect the credit balance\n\nTo see how much credit a customer has in each currency, use the\n`invoice_credit_balance` parameter:\n\n```\ncurl -G https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers/{{CUSTOMER_ID}} \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d \"expand[]\"=invoice_credit_balance\n```\n\nThe customer’s credit balance is drawn down from the next CAD invoice created\nfor this customer. It won’t, however, be drawn down for invoices created in\ndifferent currencies.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Integrate with the Invoicing\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration)\n- [Manage customers](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/customer)\n- [Products and prices](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/products-prices)\n\n## Links\n\n- [multi-currency\nPrices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models#multicurrency)\n- [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers)\n-\n[pending](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoiceitems/list#list_invoiceitems-pending)\n- [Integrate with the Invoicing\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration)\n- [Manage customers](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/customer)\n- [Products and prices](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/products-prices)",
