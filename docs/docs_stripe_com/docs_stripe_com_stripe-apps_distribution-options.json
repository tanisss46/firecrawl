You can make them\npublicly available or share them only with your [team\nmembers](https://docs.stripe.com/dashboard/teams).\n\n## Publish your app on the Stripe App Marketplace\n\nThe [Stripe App Marketplace](https://marketplace.stripe.com/) is how you share\nyour application with the Stripe user community.\n\nWhen you publish an app on the App Marketplace, make sure the app complies with\nall [app review\nrequirements](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/review-requirements#app-review-requirements).\nWe also recommend reviewing our [app listing\nguidelines](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/listing-guidelines) for best\npractices and recommended coding patterns. Stripe reviews all apps to make sure\nthey comply with the published requirements before listing them in the\nmarketplace.\n\nStripe can only support language listings at this time. To support\nadditional languages, reach out to Stripe.\n\nThe publishing process consists of these steps:\n\n- Select the version of the app that you want to publish.\n- Create an app listing that provides prospective users with information about\nyour app and defines how your app appears in the App Marketplace.\n- Submit the application for review.\n- Publish the app to the App Marketplace.\n\nFor more information, learn how to [publish your\napp](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/publish-app).\n\n## Share your app with team members\n\nWith Stripe Apps, you have the option of sharing your app only with [team\nmembers](https://docs.stripe.com/dashboard/teams). For example, you might\ndevelop an app that sends sale data into your own custom accounting system. Or\nyou might build an app that connects paid orders with your fulfillment system.\nFor these and other situations, you can make the application only available to\nteam members of your Stripe account.\n\nUnlike apps on the App Marketplace, apps shared with team members don’t go\nthrough a review process. However, we recommend reviewing our [app review\nrequirements](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/review-requirements#app-review-requirements)\nand [app listing\nguidelines](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/listing-guidelines) when you\nbuild your app.\n\nSharing your app with team members consists of these steps:\n\n- Specify that you want to share your app only with members of your Stripe\naccount.\n- Select the version of the app that you want to [upload and make\navailable](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/upload-install-app).\n\nIf you later decide you want to publish your app on the Stripe App Marketplace,\nyou must uninstall your app in [live\nmode](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/upload-install-app#install-in-live-mode)\nfirst.\n\n## Setting the distribution type for your app\n\nTo set the distribution type for your app, run the following command:\n\n```\nstripe apps set distribution public\n```\n\n```\nstripe apps set distribution private\n```\n\nThis updates the app manifest to reflect the distribution type. The new\ndistribution takes effect after you [upload your\napp](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/upload-install-app). The private\ndistribution type is the default type, which you don’t need to explicitly set.\n\n#### Caution\n\nYou can continue to change the distribution type until you upload an app. After\nyou upload an app with a public distribution, you can’t set a public\ndistribution for another app within the same Stripe account. You can change the\ndistribution type from private to public if there are no other public apps\nwithin the same Stripe account.\n\n### Updated app manifest:\n\n## App name restrictions\n\nBeginning in September 2024, Stripe apps with a `public` distribution type can’t\ncontain the words “Stripe”, “app”, “free” or “paid” in their names.\n\nThis update won’t impact your previously uploaded or published\n[versions](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/versions-and-releases). However,\nthe [Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/reference/cli) and Stripe\nDashboard will prompt you to change your app’s name in the\n[manifest](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/reference/app-manifest) if:\n\n- You [upload a new app\nversion](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/upload-install-app) with a\nrestricted name and `distribution_type` set to `public`.\n- You select a previous app version that contains a restricted name to\ndistribute with [external\ntesting](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/test-app).\n- You [submit](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/publish-app) to the [Stripe\nApp Marketplace](https://marketplace.stripe.com/) an app version with a\nrestricted name.\n\nIn all these cases, you can proceed by removing the banned words from your app\nname in the\n[manifest](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/reference/app-manifest) and\n[uploading](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/upload-install-app) a new\nversion.\n\nFor external testing or the App Marketplace, select that version (or any other\nversion without the restricted name) for distribution.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Publish your app](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/publish-app)\n- [Upload your app](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/upload-install-app)\n- [Invite team members or developers to access your Stripe\naccount](https://support.stripe.com/questions/invite-team-members-or-developers-to-access-your-stripe-account)\n- [Versions and\nreleases](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/versions-and-releases)\n\n## Links\n\n- [naming\nrestrictions](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/distribution-options#app-name-restrictions)\n- [team members](https://docs.stripe.com/dashboard/teams)\n- [Stripe App Marketplace](https://marketplace.stripe.com)\n- [app review\nrequirements](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/review-requirements#app-review-requirements)\n- [app listing\nguidelines](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/listing-guidelines)\n- [publish your app](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/publish-app)\n- [upload and make\navailable](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/upload-install-app)\n- [live\nmode](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/upload-install-app#install-in-live-mode)\n- [versions](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/versions-and-releases)\n- [Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/reference/cli)\n- [manifest](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/reference/app-manifest)\n- [external testing](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/test-app)\n- [Invite team members or developers to access your Stripe\naccount](https://support.stripe.com/questions/invite-team-members-or-developers-to-access-your-stripe-account)",
