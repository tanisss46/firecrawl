By default, Stripe Revenue\nRecognition immediately recognizes the revenue from one-time payments, but you\ncan override this behavior by\n[importing](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/data-import) a custom\nservice period.\n\nThis example is for a one time payment of 10 USD.\n\nThe journal entries generated might look like the following:\n\nDebitCreditAmountAccountsReceivablesDeferredRevenue+10.00CashAccountsReceivables+10.00DeferredRevenueRevenue+10.00\nThis nets out to leave the following end state:\n\nAccountAmountCash+10.00Revenue+10.00\n#### Caution\n\nTo incorporate a fulfillment schedule into your Revenue Recognition reports, you\nmust first [import the\ndata](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/data-import).\n\n## Links\n\n- [importing](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/data-import)",
