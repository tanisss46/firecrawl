  "content": "# Manage locations\n\n## Group and manage your readers by physical location.\n\nYou can streamline the management of multiple readers across different physical\nsites by using locations and zones.\n\nLocations and zones help by associating each reader with specific operational\nsites and guarantee that the correct regional configurations are downloaded.\n\n- **Locations**: Allows you to group readers, monitor their connectivity status,\nand modify your settings based on physical location. This functionality is\nbeneficial for marketplaces with multiple connected accounts.\n- **Zones**: Offers an optional method to further categorize locations and\nreaders. Zones enable you to represent broader groups of readers or locations,\nsuch as larger geographic regions (for example, countries) or organizational\nsub-brands. Multiple locations can belong to a single zone, and you can create a\nhierarchical structure by grouping multiple zones under a single zone.\n\n#### Note\n\nZones provide an additional way to group locations. You must still assign\nreaders to a location, and you can assign a location to only one zone.\n\nNorth America Zone\n\nCalifornia Zone\n\nWashington Zone\n\nBay Area Zone\n\nSFO Location\n\nTerminal 1 Reader\n\nTerminal 2 Reader\n\nSeattle Location\n\nSan Francisco Location\n\nCheckout 1 Reader\n\nCheckout 2 Reader\n\nExample organization strategy\n## Locations\n\nYou can create a location for each physical place where your readers operate.\nYou can [register](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/fleet/register-readers)\nmultiple readers to each location, and nest these locations within zones. Before\nyou can use a reader, you must register it to a location.\n\nThe required [address\nproperties](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/locations/create#create_terminal_location-address)\nfor a location vary by country:\n\nCountriesRequired Address PropertiesAustraliaCanadaItalySpainUnited\nStates`line1`, `city`, `state`, `postal_code`, and `country`AustriaBelgiumCzech\nRepublicDenmarkFinlandFranceGermanyLuxembourgMalaysiaNetherlandsNew\nZealandNorwayPoland+PortugalSwedenSwitzerlandUnited Kingdom`line1`, `city`,\n`postal_code`, and `country`IrelandSingapore`line1`, `postal_code`, and\n`country`+Terminal is currently in beta in this country.**Compatibility for this\nmobile SDK also applies when used with React Native.\n#### Common mistake\n\nYou can use the Dashboard or API to update a `Location` object. After you create\na location, you can’t change its country. Instead, create a new location in the\nnew country, and then re-register any readers associated with the old location.\n\n## Zones\n\nZones are the top-level groups that can consist of either more zones or\nlocations. You can add more zones nested under an existing one, creating\nadditional hierarchy levels, such as “West coast.” However, organizing your\nlocations into zones is optional.\n\n## Create locations and zones\n\nDashboardAPI\nFirst, you must [register your reader to a\nlocation](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/fleet/register-readers?dashboard-or-api=dashboard)\nto accept payments. You can manage your locations and zones in the [Manage\nlocations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/terminal/locations) page. To open this\npage from the Terminal reader page, click the **Manage locations** button on the\nReaders tab.\n\n### Create a location\n\nTo create a location:\n\n- Click the overflow menu () on the **All locations** row, then click **Create\nlocation**.\n- Enter a name and a valid address. Providing an address ensures that the\ncorrect configuration and settings are applied based on the region where the\nreaders are operating.\n- Click **Done**.\n\nYou can also create a specific\n[configuration](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/fleet/configurations-overview)\nfor that location.\n\n### Create a zone\n\nTo create a zone:\n\n- Click the overflow menu () on the **All locations** row, then click **Create\nzone**.\n- Enter a name.\n- Click **Done**.\n\n### Create a nested zone\n\nTo create a nested zone:\n\n- Click the overflow menu () on the zone for which you want to create a nested\nzone, then click **Create zone**.\n- Enter a name.\n- Click **Done**.\n\n### Add or move a location to a zone\n\nTo add or move a location to a zone:\n\n- Click the overflow menu () on the location, then click **Move location**.\n- Choose the zone or nested zone where you want to move the location.\n- Click **Done**.\n\n### Delete a location\n\nTo delete a location, you must remove the readers associate with it:\n\n- Remove all readers from the location in which you want to delete.\n- Click the overflow menu () on the location, then click **Delete location**.\n- Click **Yes, delete location**.\n\n### Delete a zone\n\nTo delete a zone, you must remove the readers associate with it:\n\n- Remove all readers from the location you want to delete, and remove all\nlocations under the zones.- (Optional) Move the locations with readers to a\ndifferent zone.\n- Click the overflow menu () on the zone, then click **Delete zone**.\n- Click **Yes, delete zone**.\n\n## Links\n\n- [register](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/fleet/register-readers)\n- [address\nproperties](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/locations/create#create_terminal_location-address)\n- [register your reader to a\nlocation](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/fleet/register-readers?dashboard-or-api=dashboard)\n- [Manage locations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/terminal/locations)\n-\n[configuration](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/fleet/configurations-overview)",
