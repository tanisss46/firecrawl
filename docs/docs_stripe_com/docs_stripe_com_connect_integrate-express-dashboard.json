  "content": "# Integrate the Express Dashboard in your platform\n\n## Learn how to direct your connected accounts to their Express Dashboard using login links.\n\nThe Express Dashboard allows connected accounts to view their available balance,\nsee upcoming [payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts), and track their\nearnings in real time. This guide shows how to implement login links that\nredirect connected accounts from your platform to their Express Dashboards.\n\nYour live mode connected accounts can also access the Express Dashboard by\n[logging into Stripe\nExpress](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/express-dashboard#self-serve-access).\nHowever, you can provide login links from your platform to facilitate the log in\nprocess.\n\n[Create a login\nlink](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/integrate-express-dashboard#create-login-link)\nUse the [Login Link](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account/create_login_link) API\nto generate a URL for an account-specific Express Dashboard login page.\n\n```\ncurl -X POST\nhttps://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts/{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}/login_links \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\"\n```\n\nA successful response returns the generated login link URL:\n\n```\n{\n \"object\": \"login_link\",\n \"created\": 1495580507,\n \"url\": \"https://stripe.com/express/Ln7FfnNpUcCU\"\n}\n```\n\n[Redirect to the login\nlink](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/integrate-express-dashboard#redirect-to-login-link)\nTypically, you generate a login link URL on demand when a connected account\nintends to visit the Express Dashboard. For example, you include an **Open\nDashboard** button in your application. When a connected account user clicks it,\nyour application calls the API to generate a login link and redirects them to\nthat URL.\n\n#### Security tip\n\nDon’t email, text, or otherwise send login link URLs outside of your platform.\nRedirect authenticated users to it only from within your platform application.\n\nWhen you redirect a connected account user to a login link, Stripe sends an SMS\nauthentication code to their phone number. They verify their identity on the\nExpress Dashboard login page by entering the code.\n\nIf they don’t have access to their account phone number, they can change it by\nclicking **I no longer have access to this phone number**. This sends a\nverification code to their account email. They can change the account phone\nnumber by entering the code. If the user changes the number, Stripe redirects\nthem to the Express Dashboard login page and sends an SMS authentication code to\nthe new number.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Customize the Express\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/customize-express-dashboard)\n- [Collect payments and then pay\nout](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/collect-then-transfer-guide) (if you\nprocess payments with Stripe)\n- [Pay out money](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/add-and-pay-out-guide) (if you\nadd money from a bank account to pay out)\n\n## Links\n\n- [payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts)\n- [logging into Stripe\nExpress](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/express-dashboard#self-serve-access)\n- [Login Link](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account/create_login_link)\n- [Customize the Express\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/customize-express-dashboard)\n- [Collect payments and then pay\nout](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/collect-then-transfer-guide)\n- [Pay out money](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/add-and-pay-out-guide)",
