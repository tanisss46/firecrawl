Download a template with all of your connected accounts that are eligible for receiving communications.\n\n![Comms Center Download\nStep](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/comms-center-download-emails.0f98ff258879870ce5a83603524c33ac.png)\n\nYou get a template CSV like this:\n\n```\nAccount ID,Business Name,First Name,Last Name,Email Address (please add or\nreplace),User has claimed primary user email address\nacct_123abc,Connected Account A,John,Doe,,✔\nacct_456def,Connected Account B,,,,✗\n\n```\n\n### 2. Add the email addresses you want to add to the business within Stripe\n\nFor example, a filled out CSV might look like this:\n\n```\nAccount ID,Business Name,First Name,Last Name,Email Address (please add or\nreplace),User has claimed primary user email address\nacct_123abc,Connected Account A,John,Doe,email-a@email.com,✔\nacct_456def,Connected Account B,,,email-b@email.com,✗\n\n```\n\n### 3. Upload the file with your changes\n\nThe filename doesn’t matter. Only the *Account ID* and *Email Address (please\nadd or replace)* fields matter here, the rest are only for validating your\nchanges.\n\n![Comms Center Upload\nStep](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/comms-center-upload-emails.9ec27a2b1c9e46fd2d342f2b2c5ed923.png)\n\n### 4.

Confirm your changes\n\nAfter confirming, you see the completion state. Updates can take some time,\ndepending on how many emails you’ve uploaded. We send email updates to any\nwebhooks you’ve configured.\n\n![Comms Center\nConfirmed](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/comms-center-confirmed.b5a1286831c481edc0055551ad4c5f6d.png)\n\n## Important usage notes\n\n- Comms Center can only currently handle CSVs with 500,000 rows. If you have\nmore than that, break up your CSV into multiple files.\n- If you get validation errors, make sure your headers on your CSV match the\nexpected headers. The required columns are `Account ID` which has the `acct_`\ntokens and `Email Address (please add or replace)` which has the desired email.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Comms Center collection\nflow](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/comms_center/collect)",
