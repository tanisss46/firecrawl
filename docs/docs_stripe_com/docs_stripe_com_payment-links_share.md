# Share a payment link

## Share payment links across social media, emails, or your website.

After you create a [payment link](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links), share
it with your customers to accept payments without a digital storefront.

## Share your link

Use the Dashboard to copy your payment link, and share it online. Click the copy
icon next to an existing link on the [Payment
Links](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payment-links) page, or go to the payment
link’s details page. You can share your payment link multiple times and anywhere
online, including:

- Emails
- Text messages
- Social media platforms

## Generate a QR code

You can create a QR code for a payment link in the Dashboard. Choose an existing
link from the **Payment Links** page, or [create a new
link](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payment-links/create) and then click **QR
code**. or download a PNG image of the QR code.

The QR code doesn’t expire. If you deactivate the underlying payment link, the
QR code redirects to an expiration page.

## Embed a button on your site

Turn your payment link into an embeddable buy button to sell a product or
subscription from your website. Select an existing link from the **Payment
Links** page or create a new link and then click **Buy button**. the code
and paste it into your website. To learn more on how to embed and customize a
button, see [Create a buy
button](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links/buy-button).

## Deactivate a link

You can use the Dashboard to deactivate a payment link. Click the overflow menu
() to the right of the desired payment link, and then **Deactivate**. After you
deactivate a link, customers are no longer able to make a purchase using it. You
can choose to reactivate the payment link at any time. You can also use the
[API](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links/api#deactivate-link) to deactivate a
payment link.
