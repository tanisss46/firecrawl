  "content": "# New requirement for out_of_band_amount when creating post-payment credit notesBreaking changes\n\n## What’s new\n\nWhen [creating](https://docs.stripe.com/api/credit_notes/create) a post-payment\ncredit note on an invoice,\n[out_of_band_amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/credit_notes/create#create_credit_note-out_of_band_amount)\nis now required if the sum of `credit_amount` and (`refund` or `refund_amount`)\nis less than the credit note total. In previous API versions\n`out_of_band_amount` is optional and, in the case that the `credit_amount` and\nrefund amounts are less than the credit note total, the difference was\nautomatically be allocated to the `out_of_band_amount`.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis enforces more explicit specification of the credit note details, ensuring\nthat all components of the credit note are clearly defined. It removes the\nprevious automatic allocation of the difference to `out_of_band_amount`, which\ngives you greater control and transparency over the credit note creation\nprocess.\n\n## Upgrade\n\n- [View your current API\nversion](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#view-your-api-version-and-the-latest-available-upgrade-in-workbench)\nin Workbench.\n- If you use an SDK, upgrade to the corresponding SDK version for this API\nversion.- If you don’t use an SDK, update your [API\nrequests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/versioning) to include `Stripe-Version:\n2019-12-03`\n- Upgrade the API version used for [webhook\nendpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks/versioning).\n- [Test your integration](https://docs.stripe.com/testing) against the new\nversion.\n- If you use Connect, [test your Connect\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/testing).\n- In Workbench, [perform the\nupgrade](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#perform-the-upgrade).
