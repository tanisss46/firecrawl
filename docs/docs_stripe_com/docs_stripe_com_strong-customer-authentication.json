  "content": "# Strong Customer Authentication readiness\n\n## Learn how the Strong Customer Authentication regulation affects your business and how to update your integration to support it.\n\n[Strong Customer Authentication\n(SCA)](https://stripe.com/guides/strong-customer-authentication), a rule in\neffect as of September 14, 2019, as part of PSD2 regulation in Europe, requires\nchanges to how your European customers authenticate online payments. Card\npayments require you to use [3D\nSecure](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure) to meet SCA requirements.\nYour customers’ banks might decline transactions that don’t follow the new\nauthentication guidelines.\n\nTo support SCA, you should:\n\n- Determine if SCA impacts your business\n- Decide which one of the SCA-ready products is right for your business\n- Make changes now to avoid declined payments\n\n#### Caution\n\nIf you use a third-party plugin, platform, or extension partner from the\n[Partners gallery](https://stripe.partners/), contact your Stripe partner to see\nif you need to make any changes to support SCA. Contact\n[Support](https://support.stripe.com/contact) if you have any questions. You can\nalso see the [frequently asked\nquestions](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication/sca-enforcement)\nfor information on SCA enforcement.\n\n## Impacted businesses and payments\n\nUpdate your Stripe integration for SCA if all of the following apply:\n\n- Your business is based in the [European Economic\nArea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Area) or you [create\npayments on behalf of connected accounts based in the\nEEA](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication/connect-platforms)\n- You serve customers in the EEA\n- You accept cards (credit or debit)\n\nWhile some low-risk transactions (based on the volume of fraud rates associated\nwith the payment provider or bank) don’t require authentication, banks can\nchoose to not honor these exemptions and request that the customer complete\nauthentication. Even if you’re primarily processing low-risk transactions,\nupdate your integration so your customers can complete authentication when\nrequested by the bank. Stripe’s [new products and\nAPIs](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication#preparing) help you\nclaim these exemptions and maximize conversion by only requesting authentication\nwhen absolutely necessary. Learn more about [SCA\nexemptions](https://stripe.com/guides/strong-customer-authentication#exemptions-to-strong-customer-authentication).\n\n## SCA-ready products and APIs\n\nWhether you collect one-time payments or save cards for later reuse, Stripe\nprovides prebuilt and customizable products to help you meet SCA requirements.\n\nIntegrations that aren’t SCA-ready, like those using the legacy [Charges\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/charges-api), might see high rates of\ndeclines from banks that enforce SCA.\n\n### One-time payments\n\nAccept card payments with the [Payment Intents\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents) and\n[Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout), a prebuilt, Stripe-hosted\ncheckout flow that automatically handles SCA requirements for you. Checkout is\ncustomizable and lets you accept payments for one-time purchases and\n[subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating) on your\nwebsite.\n\n- [Migrating to the Payment Intents\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents/migration)\n- [Use a prebuilt checkout\npage](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?integration=checkout)\n- [Build a custom payment\nflow](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?integration=elements)\n\n### Reusing cards\n\nSave a card for later reuse with the [Payment Intents\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents) and the [Setup Intents\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents). You can also use\n[Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout) to automatically handle\nSCA requirements, or use [Billing](https://docs.stripe.com/billing) to handle\nSCA for subscription models.\n\n- [Use a prebuilt checkout\npage](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-and-reuse?platform=checkout)\n- [Build a custom flow to save card\ndetails](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-and-reuse)\n- [Use Billing for subscription\nmodels](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication)\n\n## SCA migration\n\nYou might need to update your integration to support SCA. For more details about\nchanges you might need to make, see [Migrating to the Payment Intents\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents/migration) and [SCA\nmigration guide for\nBilling](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication).\n\nFor specific product recommendations based on common business scenarios, check\nout the [SCA payment flows](https://stripe.com/guides/sca-payment-flows) guide.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Watch the SCA\nvideo](https://stripe.com/payments/strong-customer-authentication)\n- [See SCA payment scenarios](https://stripe.com/guides/sca-payment-flows)\n- [View the webinar](https://go.stripe.global/sca-webinar.html)\n- [Strong Customer Authentication\n(SCA)](https://stripe.com/guides/strong-customer-authentication)\n- [3D Secure](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure)\n- [Partners gallery](https://stripe.partners)\n- [Support](https://support.stripe.com/contact)\n- [frequently asked\nquestions](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication/sca-enforcement)\n- [European Economic Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Area)\n- [create payments on behalf of connected accounts based in the\nEEA](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication/connect-platforms)\n- [SCA\nexemptions](https://stripe.com/guides/strong-customer-authentication#exemptions-to-strong-customer-authentication)\n- [Charges API](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/charges-api)\n- [Payment Intents API](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents)\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout)\n- [subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating)\n- [Migrating to the Payment Intents\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents/migration)\n- [Use a prebuilt checkout\npage](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?integration=checkout)\n- [Build a custom payment\nflow](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?integration=elements)\n- [Setup Intents API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents)\n- [Billing](https://docs.stripe.com/billing)\n- [Use a prebuilt checkout\npage](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-and-reuse?platform=checkout)\n- [Build a custom flow to save card\ndetails](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-and-reuse)\n- [Use Billing for subscription\nmodels](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication)",
