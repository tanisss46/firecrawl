You can\ncustomize the on-reader checkout UI using both prebuilt and custom elements.\n\nThe [Stripe Terminal SDK connects to the\nreader](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/connect-reader?reader-type=internet)\nover the internet, LAN, or [handoff\nmode](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/apps-on-devices/build#discover-and-connect-a-reader).\nThis reader is compatible with JavaScript SDK, iOS SDK, Android SDK, React\nNative SDK, and server-driven integrations.\n\nIf you use the [Stripe Reader\nS700](https://d37ugbyn3rpeym.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/s700_product_sheet.612cfab6b7effea90f2164ba79898a0165675e951faa3378068646c8c8bbc0ee.pdf)\nwith a point-of-sale system on a separate device and don’t need to [collect card\npayments while\noffline](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/operate-offline/collect-card-payments),\nwe recommend the [server-driven\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/setup-integration?terminal-sdk-platform=server-driven).\n\n#### Warning\n\nStripe readers aren’t liquid-proof and we recommend that users make appropriate\nefforts to make sure their devices remain dry. If your device has experienced\nliquid ingress, we recommend that you stop using the device and let it dry\nthoroughly before attempting to re-use or charge the device. If your device\ndoesn’t properly operate or charge properly after drying, you need to replace\nit.\n\n## Battery and charging status\n\nWhen the Stripe Reader S700 is on, you can check the battery level in the\ncharging LED indicator. Learn more about [Stripe Reader S700 battery\nlife](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/setup-reader#device-specs-and-accessories).\n\nLEDsMeaningThe reader is fully charged with the power cable connected.(flashing)\nThe reader is charging.The reader’s battery level is low (10-20% remaining).The\nreader’s battery level is critically low (1-9% remaining) or drained (1%\nremaining).The reader is off, or the reader is on with the power cable\ndisconnected.\nTo prolong the rechargeable battery life, the battery charging rate is reduced\noutside the 15C (59F) to 45C (113F) temperature rate. The charging stops if the\nunit temperature is below 0C (32F) or above 60C (140F).\n\n## Expected sounds during payment\n\nThe following table describes sounds that occur during successful and failed\npayments on Stripe Reader S700.\n\nTapChipSwipeSuccess1 long, high-pitched beepNo soundNot applicableFailure2\nshort, low-pitched beepsNo sound2 short beeps\n## Troubleshoot the reader\n\nMake sure your network meets all of our [network\nrequirements](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/network-requirements), and try\nthe steps in the [network\ntroubleshooting](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/network-requirements#troubleshooting)\nsection.\n\nTo begin troubleshooting, use the following common scenarios to help diagnose\nthe issue.\n\n### The reader won’t charge\n\nThe Stripe Reader S700 requires a recommended 12W of power for successful\noperation and battery charging. Stripe recommends using the AC power adapter\nthat was supplied with your reader to make sure ample power is supplied to the\nreader for operation and charging. You can order a replacement power adapter in\nthe [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/terminal/shop/).\n\nFor a deeply discharged battery, a slow charging mechanism is applied to safely\nbring the battery to a safe zone for faster charging. During this phase, the\ncharging LED indicator on the unit is on, however, the display remains off. This\nphase can take up to 30 minutes for a deeply discharged battery.\n\nIf you’re connecting the Stripe Reader S700 to a computer or laptop, make sure\nthe USB-C port can support the recommended 12W of power. The USB-A port standard\n*does not* support this power level—*do not* use it.\n\n### The reader can’t connect\n\nTo check connectivity, go to the [reader\nsettings](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/setup-reader/stripe-reader-s700#settings)\nand select **WiFi settings**. This displays all available WiFi networks. To see\nmore details about the connection, tap the connected network name.\n\n### The reader won’t update\n\nIf your reader doesn’t update, it’s possible that it can’t connect to Stripe. To\ncheck its connectivity to Stripe, go to the [reader\nsettings](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/setup-reader/stripe-reader-s700#settings),\nthen select **Diagnostics**. This displays a list of troubleshooting tests.\nCheck Stripe connectivity and make sure it says `Passed`. If the Stripe\nconnectivity test fails, follow the [troubleshooting\nsteps](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/readers/stripe-reader-s700#reader-has-ip-address,-but-is-unable-to-communicate-with-stripe).\n\nIf you use a router, refer to your router’s manual and reconfigure the\nnetworking setup.\n\n## Stripe reader software\n\nStripe maintains the software that controls the Stripe Reader S700. The reader\nreceives updates automatically from Stripe when not in use. These can include\nimprovements and required security updates from Stripe and our hardware\npartners. As reader software updates are made available, update your readers to\nthe latest available version to continue using Stripe Terminal. Failing to\ninstall a required update can prevent a reader from accepting payments.\n\nThe reader restarts every day at midnight for PCI compliance, and disconnects\nfrom the POS app every morning. Leave your reader on and connected to power to\nreceive automatic software updates. This ensures that updates happen at midnight\n(in the timezone of the [assigned\nlocation](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/fleet/locations-and-zones)) to avoid\ninterruption to sales. If you unplug the reader at night, an update could start\nwhen you turn it back on. To manually check for an update, reboot the reader.\n\n### Reader software version\n\nThe Stripe Reader S700 software consists of four components: the reader\napplication, firmware, configuration, and key identifier. The following table\nsummarizes the latest version of each of these components for the countries\nwhere the Stripe Reader S700 is available.\n\nYou can find your reader’s versions in the **Diagnostics** menu by swiping in\nfrom the left edge of the screen, tapping **Settings**, and entering the admin\ncode, **0-7-1-3-9**.\n\n#### Note\n\nIn PCI listings, the firmware identifier is in the format\n`STR7x-11-xxxxx-xxxxx`, where `xxxxx` is a placeholder for ROM version and\nfirmware version, respectively. All versions are PCI compliant.\n\nSpecifically, a PCI firmware ID `STR7x-11-WXYZZ-ABCDD` maps to ROM version\n`W.X.Y.ZZ` and firmware version `AA.BB.CC.DD.SZZZ.07`. For example,\n`STR7x-11-22404-10016` maps to ROM version `2.2.4.4` and firmware version\n`1.00.00.16`. If the ROM version only has three digits `W.X.Y`, `ZZ` is `00`.\n\nCountriesReaderFirmwareConfigurationUnited\nStates`2.28.3.0``1.00.00.20``szzz_us_v7`Canada`2.28.3.0``1.00.00.20``szzz_ca_v3`Australia`2.28.3.0``1.00.00.16.SZZZ.07``szzz_prod_au_v7`MalyasiaNew\nZealand`2.28.3.0``1.00.00.20``szzz_prod_apac_on_v4`Singapore`2.28.3.0``1.00.00.20``szzz_prod_apac_on_v4`United\nKingdomIrelandFinland`2.28.3.0``1.00.00.20``szzz_prod_eu_off_v3`AustriaBelgiumDenmarkFranceItalyGermanyNetherlandsSpainSwedenCzech\nRepublicLuxembourgPortugalSwitzerlandNorway`2.28.3.0``1.00.00.20``szzz_prod_eu_on_v4`\n### Reader software changelog\n\n#### 2025-01-29 (version 2.28.3.0)\n\n- Improved device IoT connectivity when in Doze mode.
