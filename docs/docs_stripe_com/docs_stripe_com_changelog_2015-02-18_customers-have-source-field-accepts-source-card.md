# Customers now have a source field that accepts a source or card, and updates related event typesBreaking changes

## What’s new

Replaces the `cards` and `default_card` properties on the `Customer` object with
`sources` and `default_source`. Both properties can represent `Card` objects, as
before, and `Source` objects with an `object` value of `card`. Older API
versions return both the new and old properties on `Customer`. Replaces the
`customer.card.*` and `customer.bank_account.*` events with `customer.source.*`.

## Impact

Lets you work with a more flexible and comprehensive representation of payment
methods for customers
