Revolut Pay uses the customer’s stored\nbalance or cards to fund the payment, and offers the option for non-Revolut\ncustomers to save their details after their first purchase.\n\nWhen customers select Revolut Pay as their payment method, Stripe redirects them\nto Revolut Pay’s website, where they have to authenticate with their account\ndetails or checkout as a first time user. After authenticating, Revolut Pay\nredirects customers back to your website.\n\nPayment method propertiesBusiness locationsProduct support- **Customer\nlocations**\n\nUK and EU\n- **Presentment currency**\n\nEUR, GBP\n- **Payment confirmation**\n\nCustomer-initiated\n- **Payment method family**\n\nWallet\n- **Recurring payments**\n\nYes\n- **Payout timing**\n\nStandard payout timing applies\n- **Connect support**\n\nYes\n- **Dispute support**\n\n[Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/revolut-pay#disputed-payments)\n- **Manual capture support**\n\nYes\n- **Refunds / Partial refunds**\n\n[Yes / Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/revolut-pay#refunds)\n\n## Payment flow\n\nBelow is a demonstration of the Revolut Pay payment flow from your checkout\npage:\n\n## Get started\n\nYou don’t have to integrate Revolut Pay and other payment methods individually.\nIf you use our front-end products, Stripe automatically determines the most\nrelevant payment methods to display. Go to the [Stripe\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and enable\nRevolut Pay. To get started with one of our hosted UIs, follow a quickstart:\n\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart): Our prebuilt, hosted\ncheckout page.\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart): Our drop-in UI\ncomponents.\n\n### Other payment products\n\nThe following Stripe products also let you add Revolut Pay from the Dashboard:\n\n- [Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/no-code-guide)\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n- [Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview)\n\nIf your integration requires manually listing payment methods, learn how to\n[manually configure Revolut Pay as a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/revolut-pay/accept-a-payment).\n\nCheck out the Revolut Pay [sample on\nGitHub](https://github.com/stripe-samples/accept-a-payment).\n\n## Refunds\n\nRevolut Pay supports full and partial refunds. The refund period is up to 180\ndays after the purchase. Refunds for Revolut Pay payments are asynchronous and\ntake up to 5 minutes to complete. We notify you of the final refund status using\nthe `refund.updated` or `refund.failed`\n[webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) event. When a refund succeeds, the\nstatus of the [Refund object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/refunds/object)\ntransitions to `succeeded`. If a refund fails, the status of the Refund object\ntransitions to `failed` and we return the amount to your Stripe balance. You\nthen need to arrange an alternative way of providing a refund.\n\n## Disputes\n\nCustomers must authenticate Revolut Pay payments by logging into their Revolut\naccount. This requirement helps reduce the risk of fraud or unrecognized\npayments. With [Revolut’s Buyer Protection\nPolicy](https://www.revolut.com/legal/buyer-protection-policy/), customers can\nfile a dispute, which can result in a chargeback and funds being withdrawn from\nyour Stripe account.\n\nCustomers have up to 120 calendar days from the date of purchase to file a\ndispute. The dispute process works like this:\n\n- After the customer initiates a dispute, Stripe notifies you through email, the\nStripe Dashboard, and an API `charge.dispute.created` event (if your integration\nis set up to receive [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks)).\n- Stripe holds back the disputed amount from your balance until Revolut resolves\nthe dispute.\n- Stripe requests that you upload compelling evidence that you fulfilled the\npurchase order [using the Stripe\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/responding#respond). This evidence\ncan include:\n\n- A received return confirmation (for shipped goods returned from the customer\nto you)\n- The tracking ID\n- The shipping date\n- A record of purchase for intangible goods, such as IP address or email receipt\n- A record of purchase for services or physical goods, such as phone number or\nproof of receipt\n\nThis information helps Revolut determine if a dispute is valid or if they need\nto reject it. Make sure the evidence you provide contains as much detail as\npossible from what the customer provided at checkout. You must submit the\nrequested information within 14 calendar days. Revolut makes a decision within\n35 calendar days of evidence submission. If Revolut resolves the dispute in your\nfavor, Stripe returns the disputed amount to your Stripe balance. If Revolut\nrules in favor of the customer, the balance charge becomes permanent.\n\n#### Note\n\nIf you prefer to handle disputes programmatically, you can [respond to disputes\nusing the API](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/api).\n\n## Supported currencies\n\nYou can create Revolut Pay payments in the currencies that map to your country.\nCurrently, we support `gbp` and `eur`. The default local currency for Revolut\nPay UK customers is `gbp` and for other EU customers it’s `eur`.\n\nCurrencyCountry`gbp`United Kingdom`eur`Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia,\nCyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece,\nHungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta,\nNetherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain,\nSweden\n\n## Links\n\n- [Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/business/revolut-pay/)\n- [Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/revolut-pay#disputed-payments)\n- [Yes / Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/revolut-pay#refunds)\n- [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods)\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart)\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart)\n- [Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/no-code-guide)\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n- [Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview)\n- [manually configure Revolut Pay as a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/revolut-pay/accept-a-payment)\n- [sample on GitHub](https://github.com/stripe-samples/accept-a-payment)\n- [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks)\n- [Refund object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/refunds/object)\n- [Revolut’s Buyer Protection\nPolicy](https://www.revolut.com/legal/buyer-protection-policy/)\n- [using the Stripe\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/responding#respond)\n- [respond to disputes using the API](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/api)",
