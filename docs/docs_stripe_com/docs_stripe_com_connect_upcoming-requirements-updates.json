  "content": "# Upcoming requirements updates\n\n## Learn about the changes to required verification information and how this impacts your integration with Stripe.\n\nPayments regulations aim to create a safer, more secure financial ecosystem by\nhelping prevent crimes such as money laundering, fraud, and tax evasion.\nFinancial regulators around the world enforce [Know Your Customer (KYC)\nrequirements](https://support.stripe.com/questions/know-your-customer) to make\nsure that identity information is collected, verified, and maintained from\ncertain types of businesses, and for any individuals who ultimately own,\ncontrol, or direct the business. These requirements are frequently updated by\nfinancial service regulators, card networks, and other financial institutions.\n\nThis guide provides an overview of the upcoming changes, and highlights the most\nsignificant changes. For the exhaustive list of requirements, refer to [Required\nverification\ninformation](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\nTo change how you integrate with Stripe, see [Onboarding solutions for Custom\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/onboarding).\n\nProgram:USCanadaSingapore\n*Last updated: January 4, 2023*\n\n## What’s changing\n\n- **Required information collected from connected accounts:** We’re updating the\ninformation we require from sole proprietorships, non-profits and single-member\nLLCs and simplifying how we obtain legal guardian consent for accounts opened by\nminors. In addition, an email for the account representative is now required for\nall legal entity types, and a change for government entities and public\ncompanies.\n- **How we verify business information and provide new detailed verification\nresponses:** We’re updating our criteria for valid business information and\nintroducing new verification error codes when we unable to accept or verify\ninformation provided.\n- **Threshold at which we verify tax identification numbers (TINs):** For Custom\nand Express connected accounts, we’re lowering the payments volume threshold at\nwhich we verify TINs to align with current federal tax reporting thresholds.\n- **How we prefill statement descriptors and statement descriptor prefixes:** If\na statement descriptor isn’t provided, the prefill logic has changed to use\neither the business profile name, the business URL, or the legal entity name of\nthe connected account.\n\nThese changes will affect all users with a requested\n[card_payments](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-capabilities-card_payments)\ncapability in the US.\n\n## Required information collected from connected accounts\n\nNew information collected and new fields added to the API:\n\n- Businesses that are\n[company.structure](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/create#create_account-company-structure)\nof `sole_proprietorship` and `single_member_llc`, must provide their business\naddress (“company address”). In the event that the business address is the same\nas the representative’s personal address, your connected accounts can provide\nthe same values for both.\n- Legal entities that are\n[company.structure](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/create#create_account-company-structure)\nof `government_instrumentality`, `tax_exempt_government_instrumentality`,\n`governmental_unit`, `public_company`, and `public_corporation`,\n`public_partnership` must provide an email for the account representative. This\nrequirement now applies to all legal entity types.\n- To simplify how we obtain a legal guardian’s consent for accounts opened by\nminors, the [Persons API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons) has been updated\nwith a new relationship type of `legal_guardian` as well as an\n`additional_tos_acceptances` field to record the legal guardian’s agreement to\nthe Stripe Terms of Service. If the account representative’s date of birth\nindicates the individual is a minor, then an account requirement is triggered to\nadd a `legal_guardian` before the account can be activated.\n\n## How we verify business information and provide new detailed verification responses\n\n### Updates to the information we already collect\n\nWe’ll request the following information from your connected accounts:\n\nFieldUpdated requirementsAdditional considerationsSSN or ITIN collected from\nUS-resident Representatives (Reps)Last 4 digits required at onboarding for all\naccount types (including Custom and Express connected accounts)This is the\ncurrent behavior for Standard connected accountsSSN or ITIN collected from\nUS-resident Representatives (Reps)If the last 4 digits fail to verify at\nonboarding, Reps will need to provide the full 9 digits at onboardingSSN or ITIN\ncollected from US-resident Representatives (Reps) or OwnersFull 9 digits\nrequired once payments volume exceeds $500KA Representative (Rep) is defined as\na person with significant responsibility to control, manage, or direct the\norganization; and is authorized by the organization to agree to Stripe’s terms.\nFor a representative, the full 9 digits are required at $500K only if no Owners\nare listed on the account.\n### New verification error codes\n\nWhen we’re unable to verify information provided by your connected accounts,\nwe’ll surface detailed verification responses as new error codes in the\n[requirements.errors](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-requirements-errors)\narray.
