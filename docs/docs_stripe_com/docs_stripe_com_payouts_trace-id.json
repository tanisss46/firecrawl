  "content": "# Payout Trace IDs\n\n## Track late or missing payouts with your bank.\n\nThe Trace ID is a unique identifier for a payout that our banking partners\ncreate to help you track missing or delayed payouts. If an expected payout\nhasn’t landed in your bank account after 10 business days, contact your bank for\nan update and provide the Trace ID. The Trace ID is available on the [Stripe\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payouts),\n[API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payouts/retrieve),\n[Sigma](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data) and [Payout Reconciliation\nReport](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/payout-reconciliation).\n\nFor Connect users, you can provide your connected accounts their payout Trace\nIDs by accessing them on the [Stripe\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payouts/retrieve). This enables your connected\naccounts to self-serve their late or missing payouts without the need for manual\nsupport intervention.\n\nAs a result, Connect users can:\n\n- Minimize support requests from your connected accounts relating to late or\nmissing payouts.\n- Improve user satisfaction by letting your connected accounts self-serve their\nlate or missing payout investigations with their bank.\n\n#### Trace ID Format\n\nThe format of the Trace ID is dependent on Stripe’s banking partners and might\nnot be consistent across payouts.\n\n## Availability\n\nTrace IDs are retrieved from the partner bank up to 10 days after a payout has\nbeen marked as paid. A Trace ID might not be available within this time-frame,\nin which case the Trace ID status is marked as pending. If a trace ID can’t be\nretrieved after 10 days, the Trace ID is marked as unsupported.\n\n## Dashboard\n\nTo access the Trace ID on the Dashboard:\n\n- Navigate to your [payouts](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payouts).\n- Click the payout that you want to investigate.\n- You can find the Trace ID under the *Details* section.\n\n## API\n\nYou can find the API specifications on the Stripe API docs.\n\nThe `trace_id` contains two sub-fields: `value` and `status`:\n\n- `value`: The Trace ID string that is retrieved from our banking partners when\na payout is paid.\n- `status`: The current status of the Trace ID as it is being retrieved from our\nbanking partners.\nStatusDescription`pending`When a payout is marked as paid, Stripe attempts to\nretrieve the Trace ID from the banking partner for up to 10 days. During this\ntime the `status` becomes `pending`.`supported`When the Trace ID is successfully\nretrieved from the banking partner, the `status` becomes `supported`. The\n`value` is populated at this time.`unsupported`There are some scenarios where\nthe Trace ID can’t be provided, such as when the payout is failed or the Trace\nID isn’t supported for the country and currency combination. In these cases the\n`status` is `unsupported`.\n### Retrieving a Trace ID on the API\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payouts/po_xxx \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\"\n```\n\n```\n{\n \"object\": \"list\",\n \"data\": [\n {\n \"id\": \"po_xxx\",\n \"trace_id\": {\n \"status\": \"supported\",\n \"value\": \"7UF6L35ME6bh3bk3cj51L7o93ky79X5Pb58i5LO1e\"\n }\n ...\n }\n ]\n}\n```\n\n## Sigma\n\nThe Trace ID is also accessible using Sigma. The following example query uses\nthe transfers table to retrieve Trace ID information for the three most recent\npayouts:\n\n```\nselect\n date_format(created, '%m/%d/%Y') as day,\n id,\n trace_id_status,\n trace_id\nfrom transfers\norder by day desc\nlimit 3\n```\n\n`day``id``trace_id_status``trace_id`9/9/2024po_NKQiZu88eC4SGG6AoPctuUdypendingnull9/8/2024po_SAqvUY2iqhIpDAPzdidUv2JksupportedqfbjqDXXYy7dpiximwrYxL4T29/6/2024po_GgImpsIO3gDEVOszUVfmjBCHunsupportednull\n## Support\n\nTrace IDs are available in all Stripe supported countries except the following\npayout destinations:\n\n- Argentina\n- Bolivia\n- Chile\n- Colombia\n- Egypt\n- Japan\n- Philippines\n- UK (Instant Payouts)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payouts)\n- [API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payouts/retrieve)\n- [Sigma](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data)\n- [Payout Reconciliation\nReport](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/payout-reconciliation)",
