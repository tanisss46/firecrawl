# File Section 83(b) elections as a non-US founder

## Learn about filing an 83(b) election as a non-US founder.

#### Note

Stripe Atlas does not provide tax or legal advice. Consult tax and legal
professionals for advice on how to meet ongoing legal, tax, and accounting
obligations that apply to you and your company.

If you live outside the US but file US tax returns, startup lawyers recommend
making a Section 83(b) election because it might save you on future US taxes.

If you currently don’t file US tax returns but might become a US taxpayer in the
future, it’s important to make a Section 83(b) election. Failing to do so could
lead to additional US tax liability when your stock vests.

If you’re not a US taxpayer and don’t plan to become one, making a Section 83(b)
election is unnecessary as it only impacts US tax liability.

The IRS requires a US Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) at the time of
filing. Use either your Social Security Number (SSN) or an Individual Taxpayer
Identification Number (ITIN). If you don’t have either when you incorporate with
Stripe Atlas, Stripe informs the IRS that you are a non-US taxpayer, and you
intend to apply for an ITIN after you become a US taxpayer. Consult a tax
advisor to determine if and when you should get an ITIN.

LLC founders don’t need to file an 83(b) tax election, as equity in an LLC
created with Atlas doesn’t vest.
