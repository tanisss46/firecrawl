You can\nimport transactions processed completely outside of Stripe and customize the\nrecognition terms of existing Stripe transactions to fit your business model.\nFor example, you can import data to:\n\n- **Add** a service period to a Stripe payment.\n- **Override** the service period of a line item in a Stripe\n[invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices).\n- **Split** a payment into multiple different revenue schedules.\n- **Import** an external payment processor’s data with a service period, amount,\nand currency.\n\n**Exclusion import** allows you to exclude transactions from your revenue by\nuploading the IDs of the transactions to exclude. You can exclude the following\ntypes of transactions: invoice, invoice item, invoice line item, standalone\npayment.\n\n#### Caution\n\nWhen you import data related to India, make sure you’re in compliance with India\ndata locality requirements.\n\n## General import\n\nYou can import data into Revenue Recognition reports and view all the data\nyou’ve imported from the [Data import\npage](https://dashboard.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/data-import). Click\n**Download CSV template** and select **General import CSV** to see the required\nformat for the data import feature. You can then click **Import CSV** and select\n**General import** to upload your completed template. See the following\ndescriptions of the CSV format:\n\n**Source**\n\nThe provider of the original transaction. Examples:\n\n- `Stripe` (case-insensitive) for transactions processed by Stripe\n- Any value such as `Checks` or `App Store`, an arbitrary identifier that helps\nyou group the source of a set of transactions\n\n**Transaction ID**\n\nThe ID of a transaction. Examples:\n\n- An ID such as `ch_123456` or `py_1234` for Stripe payments\n- An ID such as `in_12345` for Stripe invoices\n- Any value such as `my_internal_id` or `Check Number 1234`, an arbitrary\nidentifier that helps you track a single transaction\n\n**Split transaction ID**\n\nIf you’re not overriding an invoice line item service period or splitting a\ntransaction, you can leave this blank.\n\nWhen overriding an invoice line item service period, this is the invoice line\nitem ID. Examples:\n\n- An ID such as `il_1234`, that you can find from your Revenue Recognition\nreports at the invoice line item level\n\nIf you’re splitting a transaction, this is an arbitrary identifier that\ndifferentiates between different parts of the same transaction. Examples:\n\n- `bike`\n- `my_internal_id`\n\n**Booked date**\n\nThis is the date that you recorded the transaction in `YYYY-MM-DD` format in the\nUTC timezone.\n\n**Recognition start date**\n\nThis is the date that you want to start recognizing revenue in `YYYY-MM-DD`\nformat in the UTC timezone.\n\n**Recognition end date**\n\nThis is the date that you want to stop recognizing revenue in `YYYY-MM-DD`\nformat in the UTC timezone.\n\n**Amount**\n\nThis is the numeric amount of the transaction without any currency symbols. For\nexample, for 10.95 USD, you would specify `10.95`.\n\n**Currency**\n\nThis is the three-letter [ISO 4217 currency\ncode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) for the currency of the recognized\nrevenue of the transaction. For example, for 10.95 USD, you would specify `usd`.\nYour Stripe account must be set up to support the specified currency.\n\n**Description**\n\nThis can be any arbitrary description. You can use these in combination with\n[Revenue Recognition rules](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/rules)\nto further customize your recognized revenue.\n\n### Additional verifications\n\n- All rows must have a transaction ID.\n- All of the split parts of a transaction must have an amount that adds up to\nthe original transaction.\n- External transactions must provide a booked date, revenue recognition start\nand end date, amount, and currency.\n- We ignore overrides on payments attached to Stripe invoices, so if you want to\noverride such a payment, use the invoice itself as the transaction.\n\n## Exclusion import\n\nYou can exclude transactions from revenue and view the excluded transactions\nthat you imported from the [Data import\npage](https://dashboard.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/data-import). Click\n**Download CSV template** and select **Exclusion import CSV** to see the\nrequired format for the exclusion data import feature. You can then click\n**Import CSV** and select **Exclusion import** to upload your completed\ntemplate.\n\n**Transaction ID**\n\nTransaction ID examples include:\n\n- `ch_123456` or `py_1234` – An ID for a standalone Stripe payment. If a payment\nor charge is linked with an invoice, don’t use the charge or payment ID. Use the\ninvoice ID for exclusion instead.\n- `in_12345` – An ID for Stripe invoices.\n- `ii_12345` – An ID for Stripe invoice items.\n- `il_12345` – An ID for Stripe invoice line items.\n\n## Opening accounting periods\n\nApplying a transaction to a closed accounting period generates corrections. If\nyou want to apply past transactions directly to a past accounting period, make\nsure that the past accounting period is open. If you forgot to do this, you\ndon’t need to re-import data. Instead, you can [open the relevant accounting\nperiod](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/revenue-settings/accounting-period-control)\nand wait for the reports to be recalculated.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Manage imported\ndata](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/data-import/manage-imported-data)\n- [Examples](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/data-import/examples)\n\n## Links\n\n- [invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n- [Data import\npage](https://dashboard.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/data-import)\n- [ISO 4217 currency code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217)\n- [Revenue Recognition rules](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/rules)\n- [open the relevant accounting\nperiod](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/revenue-settings/accounting-period-control)\n- [Manage imported\ndata](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/data-import/manage-imported-data)\n- [Examples](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/data-import/examples)",
