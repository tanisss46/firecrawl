# Makes automatic sync the default capture method for PaymentIntents when not specifiedBreaking changes

## What’s new

[PaymentIntents](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents) now has
`automatic_async` as the default capture method when capture method isn’t
specified during PaymentIntents creation.

## Impact

Setting `automatic_async` as the default capture method for PaymentIntents when
not explicitly specified lets you benefit from asynchronous capture by default,
potentially improving payment success rates and reducing declines. To learn
more, see our
[guide](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents/asynchronous-capture).
