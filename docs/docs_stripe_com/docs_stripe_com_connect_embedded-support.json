  "content": "# Embedded Connect Support\n\n## Use Stripe support management features from your own website.\n\nIn some configurations that use embedded components, Stripe provides targeted\nsupport for your connected accounts. That support is available when your\nconnected accounts don’t have access to a Stripe-hosted Dashboard and your\nplatform isn’t liable for their negative balances. It includes:\n\n- A Stripe-hosted support site with self-serve content specific to Stripe’s\nembedded components\n- Access to email and live chat support for your connected accounts\n- Links to the self-serve support site in your embedded components and\nco-branded risk and compliance emails\n\nYour connected accounts might need help with payment processing-specific issues\nlike responding to disputes or confirming expected fund settlement times. They\ncan also have questions about risk interventions where only Stripe has full\nvisibility and control. Providing direct access to Stripe Support for such\nsituations greatly reduces your platform support team’s operational load. In\naddition, you can implement a complete self-serve solution for risk\ninterventions by combining that support access with [Stripe Managed\nRisk](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/embedded-risk).\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nSet up your platform with [a fully embedded connect\nconfiguration](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/build-full-embedded-integration).\nThe Stripe-hosted self-serve support site becomes discoverable to your users\nafter you implement the required [embedded\ncomponents](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\nfor your configuration.\n\n## Access the support site\n\nYour users can access the Stripe-hosted support site at\n`https://support.stripe.com/embedded-connect/`.\n\nEmbedded components include **Contact support** links in the bottom right of\neach dialog. We also include links in flows where users are most likely to need\nStripe’s help.\n\n![Dialog showing contact support\nlink](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/embedded-support-link.8b61571aab6de31dc1c643f8616b0ca0.png)\n\nEach of the following embedded components contains links to contact support:\n\n- Account management- Edit Professional details\n- Edit Public details\n- Edit Personal details\n- Edit Payout details\n- Notification banner- Compliance forms\n- Risk forms\n- Onboarding\n- Authentication dialog\n\n## Self-serve help\n\nThe support site includes articles and related questions across several topic\nareas, including the following:\n\n- Accounts\n- Declines\n- Disputes\n- Fraud\n- Legal\n- Payments\n- Payouts\n- Privacy\n- Refunds\n- Reserves\n- Verification\n\n![Example support site\narticle](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/support-site-article-example.2094c3de78b4ddf05bd4008ea5aa00fc.png)\n\n## Contacting support\n\n**Contact support** links appear on the right side of each page on the\nself-serve support site.\n\nIf the user is authenticated (for example, provided an SMS OTP), clicking the\nlink opens a support widget. The widget lets them start a real-time chat with\nSupport or send an email.\n\n![Contact support through the support\nsite](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/support-site-contact-auth.17ef846eb63e7144f1b6f4855fc05f8f.png)\n\nClicking the link while not authenticated, or clicking **Send us an email** in\nthe widget, opens a form to open a support case by email.\n\n![Chat with support through the support\nsite](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/support-site-email-form.51af965dc976df6654d3909442e33ffe.png)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Stripe Managed Risk](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/embedded-risk)\n- [a fully embedded connect\nconfiguration](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/build-full-embedded-integration)\n- [embedded\ncomponents](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)",
