It\n[connects](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/connect-reader?reader-type=internet)\nto the Stripe Terminal SDK over the internet.\n\nThis reader is compatible with the following integrations: JavaScript, iOS,\nAndroid, and React Native SDKs and server-driven.\n\nFor BBPOS WisePOS E readers, we recommend the [server-driven\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/setup-integration?terminal-sdk-platform=server-driven),\nwhich uses the Stripe API instead of a Terminal SDK. To view the reader’s parts\nand features, see the [BBPOS WisePOS E product\nsheet](https://d37ugbyn3rpeym.cloudfront.net/terminal/product-sheets/wpe_product_sheet.pdf).\n\n## LED status lights\n\nThe LEDs above the LCD display show the current status.\n\n### LED icon meanings\n\nUse this table to understand what the icons in the subsequent tables indicate.\n\nIconMeaningThe light is on.The light is flashing.The light is off.\n### Power on\n\nWhen you press and hold the power button for 2 seconds, the device powers on and\nthe right LED array flashes.\n\nLEDsMeaningThe device turned on.\n### Battery and charging status\n\nWhen the BBPOS WisePOS E is on, you can check the battery level in the left LED\narray. Learn more about [BBPOS WisePOS E battery\nlife](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/setup-reader#device-specs-and-accessories).\n\nLEDsMeaningCharging or full charge\nIf the first LED is red, there might be an issue with charging.\n\n### Contactless and reader status\n\nWhen you connect to the BBPOS WisePOS E, you can check the reader status in the\nright LED array.\n\nLEDs MeaningReader is in bootloader mode and has reverted to default keys.Reader\nintegrity check failed or reader tampered. If this occurs, and your reader is\nunder warranty, [contact support](https://support.stripe.com/contact/) from the\nStripe account that ordered your reader and include the serial number of the\ndevice to arrange a replacement reader.(2 seconds) Reader is experiencing a hard\nfault and might need replacing. [Contact\nsupport](https://support.stripe.com/contact/).\n## Expected sounds during payment\n\nThe following table describes sounds that occur during successful and failed\npayments on the BBPOS WisePOS E.\n\nTapChipSwipeSuccess1 long, high-pitched beepNo soundNo soundFailure1 long,\nhigh-pitched beepNo soundNo sound\n## Troubleshoot the reader\n\nMake sure your network meets all of our [network\nrequirements](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/network-requirements), and try\nthe steps in the [network\ntroubleshooting](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/network-requirements#troubleshooting)\nsection.\n\nTo begin troubleshooting, use the following common scenarios to help diagnose\nthe issue.\n\n### Reader is unable to connect\n\nTo check connectivity, go to\n[settings](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/setup-reader/bbpos-wisepos-e#settings),\nthen select **WiFi settings**. This displays all available WiFi networks. To see\nmore details about the connection, tap the connected network name.\n\n### Reader is unable to connect to Ethernet, even though docked\n\nYou must connect both cables before inserting the reader into the dock. Remove\nthe reader and re-insert into the dock.\n\n### Reader is unable to update\n\nIf your reader doesn’t update, it’s possible that it can’t connect to Stripe. To\ncheck its connectivity to Stripe, go to\n[settings](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/setup-reader/bbpos-wisepos-e#settings),\nthen select **Diagnostics**. This displays a list of troubleshooting tests.\nCheck Stripe connectivity and make sure it says “Passed.” If the Stripe\nconnectivity test fails, follow [these\nsteps](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/network-requirements#troubleshooting).\n\n#### Note\n\nIf you use a router, refer to your router’s manual and reconfigure the\nnetworking setup.\n\n## Stripe reader software\n\nStripe maintains the software that controls the BBPOS WisePOS E. The reader\nreceives updates automatically from Stripe when not in use. These can include\nimprovements and required security updates from Stripe and our hardware\npartners. As reader software updates are made available, update your readers to\nthe latest available version to continue using Stripe Terminal. Failing to\ninstall a required update can prevent a reader from accepting payments.\n\nThe reader restarts every day at midnight for PCI compliance, and disconnects\nfrom the POS app every morning. Leave your reader on and connected to power to\nreceive automatic software updates. This ensures that updates happen at midnight\n(in the timezone of the [assigned\nlocation](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/fleet/locations-and-zones)) to avoid\ninterruption to sales. If you unplug the reader at night, an update could start\nwhen you turn it back on. To manually check for an update, reboot the reader.\n\n### Reader software version\n\nThe BBPOS WisePOS E software consists of four components: the reader\napplication, firmware, configuration, and key identifier. The following table\nsummarizes the latest version of each of these components for the countries\nwhere WisePOS E is available. You can find your reader’s versions in the\n**Diagnostics** menu by swiping in from the left edge of the screen, tapping\n**Settings**, and entering the admin code, **0-7-1-3-9**.\n\n#### Note\n\nIn PCI listings, the firmware identifier is in the format\n`WSC5x.11-xxxxx-xxxxx`, where `xxxxx` is a placeholder for ROM version and\nfirmware version, respectively. All versions are PCI compliant.\n\nSpecifically, a PCI firmware ID `WSC5x.11-WXYZZ-ABCDD` maps to ROM version\n`W.X.Y.ZZ` and reader version `AA.BB.CC.DD`. For example, `WSC5x.11-18302-50127`\nmaps to ROM version `1.8.3.2` and firmware version `5.00.01.27`. If the ROM\nversion only has three digits `W.X.Y`, `ZZ` is `00`.\n\nCountriesReaderFirmwareConfigurationUnited\nStates`2.28.3.0``5.00.01.27.szzz.01``szzz_us_v16`Canada`2.28.3.0``5.00.01.27.szzz.01``szzz_ca_v15`Australia`2.28.3.0``5.00.01.27.szzz.01.eftpos``szzz_prod_au_v8`MalaysiaNew\nZealand`2.28.3.0``5.00.01.27.szzz.01``szzz_prod_apac_on_v4`Singapore`2.28.3.0``5.00.01.27.szzz.01``szzz_prod_apac_off_v3`United\nKingdomIrelandFinland`2.28.3.0``5.00.01.27.szzz.01``szzz_prod_eu_off_v11`AustriaBelgiumDenmarkFranceItalyGermanyNetherlandsSpainSwedenCzech\nRepublicLuxembourgPortugalSwitzerlandNorway`2.28.3.0``5.00.01.27.szzz.01``szzz_prod_eu_on_v5`\n### Reader software changelog\n\n#### 2025-01-29 (version 2.28.3.0)\n\n- Improved device IoT connectivity when in Doze mode.
