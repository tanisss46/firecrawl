  "content": "# Products now require a type field, differentiating their use with order SKUs or subscriptions and plansBreaking changes\n\n## What’s new\n\nProducts now have a required `type`: `good` for products used with orders SKUs,\nor `service` for products used with subscriptions and plans. On API versions\nolder than 2018-02-05, `type` is set to `good` by default, and `GET\n/v1/products` omits products with `type=service` from the list. If you want to\nsee products with `type=service` on API versions older than 2018-02-05, you can\nspecify\n[type=service](https://docs.stripe.com/api/products/list#list_products-type)\nwhen listing products.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis change introduces a required `type` attribute for products, distinguishing\nbetween physical goods and subscription services. You can now categorize your\nproducts more accurately.\n\n## Upgrade\n\n- [View your current API\nversion](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#view-your-api-version-and-the-latest-available-upgrade-in-workbench)\nin Workbench.\n- If you use an SDK, upgrade to the corresponding SDK version for this API\nversion.- If you don’t use an SDK, update your [API\nrequests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/versioning) to include `Stripe-Version:\n2018-02-05`\n- Upgrade the API version used for [webhook\nendpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks/versioning).\n- [Test your integration](https://docs.stripe.com/testing) against the new\nversion.\n- If you use Connect, [test your Connect\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/testing).\n- In Workbench, [perform the\nupgrade](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#perform-the-upgrade).
