We\nrecommend that you configure your payment methods from the Stripe Dashboard\nusing the instructions in [Accept a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web&ui=stripe-hosted).\n\nIf you want to continue manually configuring the payment methods you present to\nyour customers with Checkout, use this guide. Otherwise, update your integration\nto [configure payment methods in the\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/dashboard-payment-methods).\n\nAccepting SEPA Direct Debit payments on your website consists of creating an\nobject to track a payment, collecting payment method information and mandate\nacknowledgement, and submitting the payment to Stripe for processing. Stripe\nuses this payment object, the PaymentIntent, to track and handle all the states\nof the payment until the payment completes.\n\n#### Note\n\nSEPA Direct Debit is a **delayed notification payment method**, which means that\nfunds are not immediately available after payment. A payment typically takes **5\nbusiness days** to arrive in your account.\n\n[Determine\ncompatibility](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sepa-debit/accept-a-payment#compatibility)\nTo support SEPA Direct Debit payments in Checkout,\n[Prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices) for all line items must be\nexpressed in Euro (currency code `eur`).\n\n[Accept a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sepa-debit/accept-a-payment#accept-a-payment)\n#### Note\n\nThis guide builds on the foundational [accept a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?ui=stripe-hosted)\nCheckout integration.\n\nUse this guide to learn how to enable SEPA Direct Debit—it shows the differences\nbetween accepting a card payment and using SEPA Direct Debit.\n\n### Enable SEPA Direct Debit as a payment method\n\nWhen creating a new [Checkout\nSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions), you need to:\n\n- Add `sepa_debit` to the list of `payment_method_types`.\n- Make sure all your `line_items` use the `eur` currency.\n\n```\nStripe::Checkout::Session.create({\n mode: 'payment',\n payment_method_types: ['card'],\n payment_method_types: ['card', 'sepa_debit'],\n line_items: [{\n price_data: {\n currency: 'usd',\n # To accept `sepa_debit`, all line items must have currency: eur\n currency: 'eur',\n product_data: {\n name: 'T-shirt',\n },\n unit_amount: 2000,\n },\n quantity: 1,\n }],\n success_url: 'https://example.com/success',\n cancel_url: 'https://example.com/cancel',\n})\n```\n\n### Fulfill your orders\n\nAfter accepting a payment, learn how to [fulfill\norders](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/fulfillment).\n\n[Test your\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sepa-debit/accept-a-payment#test-integration)\nStripe provides several test numbers you can use to make sure your integration\nis ready for production.\n\nUse the [SEPA Direct Debit test\nnumbers](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sepa-debit/accept-a-payment#test-integration)\nwhen testing your Checkout integration with SEPA Direct Debit.\n\n##### Test IBANs\n\nAustriaBelgiumCroatiaEstoniaFinlandFranceGermanyGibraltarIrelandLiechtensteinLithuaniaLuxembourgNetherlandsNorwayPortugalSpainSwedenSwitzerlandUnited\nKingdomAccount NumberDescription`AT611904300234573201`The PaymentIntent status\ntransitions from `processing` to `succeeded`.`AT321904300235473204`The\nPaymentIntent status transitions from `processing` to `succeeded` after at least\nthree minutes.`AT861904300235473202`The PaymentIntent status transitions from\n`processing` to `requires_payment_method`.`AT051904300235473205`The\nPaymentIntent status transitions from `processing` to `requires_payment_method`\nafter at least three minutes.`AT591904300235473203`The PaymentIntent status\ntransitions from `processing` to `succeeded`, but a dispute is immediately\ncreated.`AT981904300000343434`The payment fails with a\n`charge_exceeds_source_limit` failure code due to payment amount causing account\nto exceed its weekly payment volume limit.`AT601904300000121212`The payment\nfails with a `charge_exceeds_weekly_limit` failure code due to payment amount\nexceeding account's transaction volume limit.[Handle refunds and\ndisputes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sepa-debit/accept-a-payment#refunds-and-disputes)\nThe refund period for SEPA Direct Debit is up to 180 days after the original\npayment.\n\n[Customers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers) can dispute a payment through\ntheir bank up to 13 months after the original payment and there’s no appeal\nprocess.\n\nLearn more about [SEPA Direct Debit\ndisputes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sepa-debit#disputed-payments).\n\n[OptionalCustomize mandate references with a\nprefix](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sepa-debit/accept-a-payment#mandate-reference-prefix)\n## See also\n\n- [Save SEPA Direct Debit details for future\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sepa-debit/set-up-payment)\n- [Connect payments](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Accept a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web&ui=stripe-hosted)\n- [configure payment methods in the\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/dashboard-payment-methods)\n- [Prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices)\n- [accept a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?ui=stripe-hosted)\n- [Checkout Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions)\n- [https://example.com/success](https://example.com/success)\n- [https://example.com/cancel](https://example.com/cancel)\n- [fulfill orders](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/fulfillment)\n- [Customers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers)\n- [SEPA Direct Debit\ndisputes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sepa-debit#disputed-payments)\n- [Save SEPA Direct Debit details for future\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sepa-debit/set-up-payment)\n- [Connect payments](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges)",
