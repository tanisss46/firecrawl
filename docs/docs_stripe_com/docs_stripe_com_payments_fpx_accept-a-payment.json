We\nrecommend that you configure your payment methods from the Stripe Dashboard\nusing the instructions in [Accept a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web&ui=stripe-hosted).\n\nIf you want to continue manually configuring the payment methods you present to\nyour customers with Checkout, use this guide. Otherwise, update your integration\nto [configure payment methods in the\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/dashboard-payment-methods).\n\nFPX is a [single-use](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#usage)\npayment method. Customers pay with FPX by redirecting from your website, sending\nyou payment, then returning to your website where you get [immediate\nnotification](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#payment-notification)\non whether the payment succeeded or failed.\n\n[Determine\ncompatibility](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/fpx/accept-a-payment#compatibility)\nA Checkout Session must satisfy all of the following conditions to support FPX\npayments:\n\n- [Prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices) for all line items must be in the\nsame currency.
