# Changing a subscription to a new plan with a trial now extends the trial periodBreaking changes

## What’s new

When changing the plan on a subscription to a new plan with a trial (together
with `trial_from_plan=true`), the new plan’s full trial period is now added to
the subscription, without subtracting already-used time from previous trials.

## Impact

This change allows you to apply a new plan’s full trial period to a subscription
when changing plans, regardless of previous trial usage. It provides more
flexibility in subscription management, enabling extended trial periods even for
customers who have already had trials.
