  "content": "# Pre-authorized debit payments in Canada\n\n## Learn how to accept pre-authorized debit payments in Canada.\n\nStripe users in Canada and the United States can accept pre-authorized debit\npayments (PADs) from customers with a Canadian bank account using the Automated\nClearing Settlement System (ACSS) provided by [Payments\nCanada](https://www.payments.ca/).\n\nBefore debiting a customer’s bank account, businesses must first collect a\n[mandate](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/acss-debit#mandates) from the\ncustomer defining a specific payment schedule or terms. The mandate includes the\ncustomer’s institution number, transit number, account number, name, and email.\n\nWhen you use Stripe.js, our foundational JavaScript library for building payment\nflows, Stripe provides a hosted solution for collecting mandates from customers\nusing your preferred terms, as well as fully-hosted collection of bank account\ndetails and instant bank verification (and delayed verification using\nmicro-deposits in rare cases). This verification process is a requirement to\naccept PADs, and can also help to reduce payment failures and fraudulent\nactivities.\n\nCanadian pre-authorized debits are a\n[reusable](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#usage), [delayed\nnotification](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#payment-notification)\npayment method. It can take up to 5 business days after initiating a payment to\nreceive notification of success or failure. PADs aren’t a guaranteed payment\nmethod. There is a risk of failed payments and\n[disputes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/acss-debit#disputed-payments).\n\nPayment method propertiesBusiness locationsProduct support- **Customer\nlocations**\n\nCA\n- **Presentment currency**\n\nCAD, USD (in [rare\ncases](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/acss-debit#presentment-currency))\n- **Payment confirmation**\n\nBusiness-initiated\n- **Payment method family**\n\nBank debit\n- **Recurring payments**\n\nYes\n- **Payout timing**\n\n5-7 days\n- **Connect support**\n\nYes\n- **Dispute support**\n\n[Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/acss-debit#disputed-payments)\n- **Manual capture support**\n\nNo\n- **Refunds / Partial refunds**\n\n[Yes / Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/acss-debit#refunds)\n\n## Payment flow\n\n!\n\n[Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers) selects pre-authorized debit\nat checkout\n\n!\n\nCustomer provides bank information and accepts mandate\n\n!\n\nCustomer gets notification that the payment is complete\n\n## Get started\n\n#### Note\n\nSubscription mode in [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout) isn’t\nyet supported.

If you use our front-end products, Stripe automatically\ndetermines the most relevant payment methods to display. Go to the [Stripe\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and enable\nCanadian pre-authorized debit. To get started with one of our hosted UIs, follow\na quickstart:\n\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart): Our prebuilt, hosted\ncheckout page.\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart): Our drop-in UI\ncomponents.\n\n### Other payment products\n\nThe following Stripe products also let you add Canadian pre-authorized debit\nfrom the Dashboard:\n\n- [Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/no-code-guide)\n- [Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview)\n\nIf you prefer to manually list payment methods or want to save Canadian\npre-authorized debit details for future payments, see the following guides:\n\n- [Manually configure Canadian pre-authorized debit as a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/acss-debit/accept-a-payment)\n- [Save Canadian pre-authorized debit details for future\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/acss-debit/set-up-payment)\n\n## Mandates\n\nDuring the payment flow, Stripe helps you collect a mandate which gives your\nbusiness authorization to debit the customer’s account. In Canada, these are\ncalled pre-authorized debit agreements or PAD agreements. The mandate\ncollection, confirmation and pre-debit notification requirements for\npre-authorized debits are governed by Payments Canada’s [Rule H1 for\npre-authorized debits\n(PADs)](https://www.payments.ca/sites/default/files/h1eng.pdf).\n\nInstructions for collecting mandate acceptance can be found on the [Accept a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/acss-debit/accept-a-payment) page. In\nthe unlikely event that your business requires a custom agreement, information\non how to create a mandate that meets Payments Canada requirements can be found\non the [Custom PAD mandate\nagreements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/acss-debit/custom-pad-agreement)\npage.\n\nStripe will initiate the first debit immediately after mandate acceptance. Your\ncustomers must receive confirmation of a new mandate within 5 days after they\nhave accepted the mandate (see [Mandate and debit notification\nemails](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/acss-debit#mandate-and-debit-notification-emails)).\n\nCustomers can at any time request the cancellation of a mandate, including by\nproperly giving oral notice of cancellation. To cancel a mandate, a customer\nmust either reach out to the business they established the mandate with, or to\ntheir bank. Canceling a mandate invalidates any further debit requests that you\nissue using this mandate. If you wish to accept additional payments from the\ncustomer, a new mandate must be established with them.\n\n### Payment Schedule\n\nEach PAD mandate must specify a [payment\nschedule](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-payment_method_options-acss_debit-mandate_options-payment_schedule)\nthat defines when and how debits can be automatically charged to a customer.\n\nScheduleUse Case\n`interval`\n\nSubsequent payments for set interval PADs can be charged to customers outside of\nyour checkout flow on a specified schedule or based on triggering events clearly\ndescribed in the mandate with an [interval\ndescription](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-payment_method_options-acss_debit-mandate_options-interval_description).\n\nOne or more debits that occur with predictability, such as:\n\n- a one-time payment on a specific date\n- on a set of dates\n- on a regular basis (for example, weekly, monthly)\n- on the occurrence of certain criteria or events\n\nSome example `interval_description` values for which you could debit:\n\n- on the 5th of every month\n- on completion of checkout\n- on acceptance of a contract\n- when a customer balance owing reaches $100\n- when any invoice becomes due\n\n`sporadic`\n\nDebits that are infrequent or irregular and not at specified or predictable\nperiods or time. Sporadic PADs can be charged to customers at arbitrary times,\nbut only with the express authorization of the customer at the time of payment\n(such as logging into your website).\n\nAn example of a sporadic payment could be a balance owed by the customer where\npayment is triggered by the customer rather than automatically by you at a\ncertain time. Collecting bank account details and a `sporadic` mandate ahead of\ntime would allow your customer to trigger payment with a single step.\n\n`combined`A mandate that would allow both `interval` and `sporadic` debits.\n## Mandate and debit notification emails\n\nThe [Payments Canada network\nrules](https://www.payments.ca/sites/default/files/h1eng.pdf) require that you\nnotify your customer:\n\n- When a mandate is established\n- Each time a debit is made on their account\n\nIn addition, should your customer’s bank account need to be verified using\nmicro-deposits, Stripe will send reminder emails linking to a hosted\nverification page.\n\nBy default, Stripe automatically sends emails to the customer for these cases.\nYou can [customize the colors and\nlogo](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/branding) for these emails to fit the\ndesign and branding of your business.\n\n#### Warning\n\nIf you prefer to send custom notifications, all of these emails must be\nsupported. It is not possible to send custom notifications for only one of them.\n\nTo send custom notifications:\n\n- Turn off Stripe emails in the [Stripe Dashboard email\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/emails)\n- Send a **mandate confirmation** email when you have collected your customer’s\nbank account and mandate authorization.- Mandate confirmation emails must be\nsent no later than 5 calendar days after your customer has accepted the mandate.\nStripe will initiate the first debit immediately after mandate acceptance.\n- The email must include the mandate you created for the debit (see [Custom PAD\nmandate\nagreements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/acss-debit/custom-pad-agreement))\nand the bank account information collected from your customer, including the\ninstitution number, transit number and last four digits of the account number.\n- Use the\n[charge.pending](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-charge.pending)\nevent to trigger **debit notification** emails.- Debit notification emails must\ninclude: your contact information, the last 4 digits of your customer’s bank\naccount, and the amount to be debited.\n\n## Disputes\n\nCanadian pre-authorized debits provide a dispute process for bank account\nholders to dispute payments. Customers can dispute a debit payment through their\nbank on a “no questions asked” basis for up to 90 calendar days after a debit on\na personal account or up to 10 business days for a business account. The\ncustomer’s bank can honor any dispute within this period.\n\nWhen a dispute is created, Stripe sends both the\n[charge.dispute.created](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-charge.dispute.created)\nand\n[charge.dispute.closed](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-charge.dispute.closed)\n[webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) events, and deducts the amount of\nthe dispute and associated dispute fee from your Stripe balance.\n\nUnlike [credit card disputes](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes), all PAD\ndisputes are final and there is no process for appeal. If a customer\nsuccessfully disputes a payment, you must contact them if you want to resolve\nthe situation. If you’re able to come to an arrangement and your customer is\nwilling to return the funds to you, they must make a new payment.\n\n#### Warning\n\nIf you proactively issue your customer a refund while the customer’s bank also\ninitiates the dispute process, your customer might receive two credits for the\nsame transaction. You should follow the guidelines in the following section on\nrefunds to avoid this happening.\n\n## PADs transaction failures\n\nPADs transactions can fail any time after the payment is initiated through\npayment confirmation. These failures can occur for a number of reasons, such as:\n\n- Insufficient funds\n- An invalid account number\n- A customer disabling debits from their bank account\n\nIf a payment fails after funds have been made available in your Stripe balance,\nStripe immediately removes funds from your Stripe account.\n\nIn rare situations, Stripe might receive a PADs failure from the bank after a\nPaymentIntent has transitioned to `succeeded`. If this happens, Stripe creates a\ndispute with a `reason` of:\n\n- `insufficient_funds`\n- `incorrect_account_details`\n- `bank_cannot_process`\n\nStripe charges a failure fee in this situation.\n\n## Payouts\n\nPre-authorized debit payments are subject to a minimum 5 business day [payout\ntiming](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts#standard-payout-timing) from charge\ncreation. If your payout timing is longer than 5 business days, payouts from PAD\npayments will be unified with card payouts.\n\n## Presentment currency Optional\n\nMost bank accounts in Canada hold Canadian dollars (CAD), with a small number of\naccounts in other currencies, including US dollars (USD). It is possible to\naccept PAD payments in either CAD or USD, but choosing the correct currency for\nyour customer is important to avoid payment failures.\n\nUnlike many card-based payment methods, you might not be able to successfully\ndebit a CAD account in USD or debit a USD account in CAD. Most often, attempting\nto do so will result in a delayed payment failure that will take up to 5\nbusiness days.\n\nTo avoid these failures, it is safest to take PAD payments in CAD unless you are\nconfident your customer’s account will accept USD debits.\n\n## Refunds\n\nRefunds for PADs must be submitted within 180 days from the date of the original\npayment. Refunds require additional time to process (typically 3 business days).\nIf you accidentally debit your customer, please contact them immediately to\navoid a payment dispute.\n\nRefunds are processed only after the payment process is complete. If you create\na full or partial refund on a payment that hasn’t yet completed, the refund is\nactioned when the `Charge` object’s status transitions to `succeeded`. If the\n`Charge` object’s status transitions to `failed`, the full or partial refund is\nmarked as canceled because the money was never debited from the customer’s bank\naccount.\n\nPAD refunds are not explicitly labeled as refunds when the funds are deposited\nback to a customer’s bank account. Instead, refunds are processed as a credit\nand include a reference to the original payment’s statement descriptor.\n\nDue to longer settlement time periods and how banks process PAD transactions,\nthere is potential for confusion between you, your customer, your customer’s\nbank, and Stripe. For example, your customer might contact both you and their\nbank to dispute a payment. If you proactively issue your customer a refund while\nthe customer’s bank also initiates the dispute process, your customer might\nreceive two credits for the same transaction.\n\nWhen issuing a refund, you should inform your customer immediately that the\nrefund typically takes 3 business days to arrive in their bank account.\n\n## Statement descriptors\n\nEvery PAD payment shows up on customers’ bank statements with the *name of the\nmerchant*. For PAD payments created with Stripe, the name of the merchant is\nyour Stripe account’s [statement\ndescriptor](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/statement-descriptors).\nYou can override this default behavior for every transaction independently by\nusing a [dynamic statement\ndescriptor](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents#dynamic-statement-descriptor).\nTo do so, you can specify the\n[statement_descriptor](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-statement_descriptor)\nparameter when creating the `PaymentIntent`.\n\n#### Caution\n\nYour statement descriptor will be truncated to the first 15 alphanumeric\ncharacters on the bank statement. For example, if your statement descriptor is\n`ROCKETRIDESLIMITED`, the customer will see `ROCKETRIDESLIMI`.\n\nAdditionally, statement descriptors cannot use the special characters `<`, `>`,\n`'`, or `\"`.\n\nThe table below illustrates the *merchant name* behavior you can expect on the\ncustomer’s bank statement:\n\nDefault statement descriptorDynamic statement descriptorMerchant nameBank\nstatement descriptorRocket RidesUnspecified`Rocket Rides``Rocket Rides`Rocket\nRides`Sunday Ride``Rocket Rides``Sunday Ride`\nEach bank in Canada formats these fields differently. Depending on your\ncustomer’s bank, some fields might appear in all lowercase or uppercase.\n\n### Statement descriptors and Connect\n\nThe charge type of Connect payments changes the statement descriptor and the\nmerchant name, which appears on the customer’s bank statement.\n\nCharge typeDescriptor taken fromDirectConnected\nAccountDestinationPlatformSeparate charge and transferPlatformDestination (with\n`on_behalf_of`)Connected AccountSeparate charge and transfer (with\n`on_behalf_of`)Connected Account\nA mandate collected for a `PaymentIntent` `on_behalf_of` a Connected Account\ncannot be used with a different Connected Account.\n\n## Smart retries Private preview\n\n## Request early access to ACSS Debit smart retries\n\nJoin our private preview.\n\nCollect EmailSign upRead our [privacy policy](https://stripe.com/privacy).\n\n## Links\n\n- [Payments Canada](https://www.payments.ca)\n- [pricing details](https://stripe.com/pricing/local-payment-methods)\n- [reusable](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#usage)\n- [delayed\nnotification](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#payment-notification)\n- [Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/acss-debit#disputed-payments)\n- [Yes / Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/acss-debit#refunds)\n- [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers)\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout)\n- [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods)\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart)\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart)\n- [Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/no-code-guide)\n- [Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview)\n- [Manually configure Canadian pre-authorized debit as a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/acss-debit/accept-a-payment)\n- [Save Canadian pre-authorized debit details for future\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/acss-debit/set-up-payment)\n- [Rule H1 for pre-authorized debits\n(PADs)](https://www.payments.ca/sites/default/files/h1eng.pdf)\n- [Custom PAD mandate\nagreements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/acss-debit/custom-pad-agreement)\n- [payment\nschedule](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-payment_method_options-acss_debit-mandate_options-payment_schedule)\n- [interval\ndescription](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-payment_method_options-acss_debit-mandate_options-interval_description)\n- [customize the colors and logo](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/branding)\n- [Stripe Dashboard email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/emails)\n-\n[charge.pending](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-charge.pending)\n-\n[charge.dispute.created](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-charge.dispute.created)\n-\n[charge.dispute.closed](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-charge.dispute.closed)\n- [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks)\n- [credit card disputes](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes)\n- [payout timing](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts#standard-payout-timing)\n- [statement\ndescriptor](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/statement-descriptors)\n- [dynamic statement\ndescriptor](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents#dynamic-statement-descriptor)\n-\n[statement_descriptor](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-statement_descriptor)\n- [privacy policy](https://stripe.com/privacy)",
