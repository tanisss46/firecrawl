# Transfers are now split into payouts and transfersBreaking changes

## What’s new

Splits the `Transfer` object into `Payout` and `Transfer`. The `Payout` object
represents money moving from a Stripe account to an external account (bank or
debit card). The `Transfer` object now only represents money moving between
Stripe accounts on a Connect platform. For more details, see [Transfer Payout
Split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).

## Impact

Introduces a clearer distinction between payouts to external accounts and
transfers between Stripe accounts on a Connect platform. You can now manage
these two types of transactions more specifically, with payouts for external
transfers and transfers for internal platform movements.
