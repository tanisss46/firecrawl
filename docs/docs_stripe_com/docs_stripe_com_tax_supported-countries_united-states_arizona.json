Stripe also\nnotifies you with email and Dashboard alerts when you need to register to\ncollect tax. Learn more about how the [monitoring tool\nworks](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/monitoring).\n\nRemote sellers must register to collect and remit tax in Arizona when, in the\nprevious calendar year, they exceed a sales threshold of 250,000 USD.\n\nThe threshold includes gross sales, except marketplace sales. The threshold\nexcludes marketplace sales.\n\n## Register to collect tax\n\nRegister for sales tax in Arizona at the [tax\nauthority](https://azdor.gov/business/transaction-privilege-tax). Read more\nabout registering for [sales tax in the US in our\nguide](https://stripe.com/guides/sales-tax-registration-process-us). You can\nalso use [Stripe to\nregister](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/use-stripe-to-register) on your behalf.\n\nAfter you’ve registered to collect tax in Arizona, go to\n[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations?location=us-az)\nto add your registrations to Stripe in the Dashboard. This turns on tax\ncalculation and collection in Stripe for your transactions in Arizona.\n\nLearn [how to add your\nregistration](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/registering#track-your-registrations-in-the-tax-dashboard)\nin the Dashboard.\n\n## How we calculate taxes\n\nIf your [origin address](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/set-up#origin-address) is\nin the US and differs from your customer’s state, Stripe always calculates tax\nbased on your customer’s location.\n\nIf your customer is in Arizona and your origin address is also in Arizona,\nStripe applies tax based on your origin address, depending on the type of\nproduct or service you sell.\n\n## Report and file your taxes\n\nStripe provides reports of your completed tax transactions. Go to\n[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations) to access these\nreports.\n\n### Exports\n\nThe tax transaction data export provides a comprehensive and aggregated view of\ntransactions by location, including a breakdown of individual tax amounts. Learn\nmore about [tax reporting exports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports#exports).\n\n### Location reports\n\n[Location reports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports#us-location-reports)\noffer a summary of transaction and refund data for specific US locations and\nalign with Arizona filing requirements. You have the option to report on an\nannual, quarterly, or monthly basis.\n\nReporting-specific considerations:\n\n- Some areas of Arizona have a different tax rate for purchases of a certain\nvalue. The different tax rate can be applied to either the total price of the\npurchase or only the amount above the triggering price. You won’t see a location\nreport for Arizona if you have these transactions. Use the\n[exports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports#exports) instead for a detailed\ntax breakdown of each transaction.\n- Native American reservations that are located in Arizona might impose Tribal\ntaxes when doing business within their borders. A warning message appears when a\nreport contains a transaction from this location. These taxes are not managed by\nthe state and require separate filing.\n\n### Filing\n\nStripe Tax has filing partners—Taxually, Marosa, and Hands-off Sales Tax\n(HOST)—to help automate your tax filing. These partners automatically sync your\ntax transaction data in real time, eliminating the need for manual data entry or\nfile transfers. Learn more about [tax\nfiling](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/filing).\n\n## Links\n\n- [Thresholds](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/thresholds)\n- [monitoring tool works](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/monitoring)\n- [tax authority](https://azdor.gov/business/transaction-privilege-tax)\n- [sales tax in the US in our\nguide](https://stripe.com/guides/sales-tax-registration-process-us)\n- [Stripe to register](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/use-stripe-to-register)\n- [Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations?location=us-az)\n- [how to add your\nregistration](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/registering#track-your-registrations-in-the-tax-dashboard)\n- [origin address](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/set-up#origin-address)\n- [Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations)\n- [tax reporting exports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports#exports)\n- [Location reports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports#us-location-reports)\n- [tax filing](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/filing)",
