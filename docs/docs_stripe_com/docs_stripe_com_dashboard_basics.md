# Web Dashboard

## Learn how to use the web version of the Stripe Dashboard.

The [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/) is the user interface
where you manage and configure your account. You can use the Dashboard to
navigate account resources, [search
transactions](https://docs.stripe.com/dashboard/search), invite team members,
monitor your integration, and more. On your keyboard, press the question mark
key (`?`) for a list of available keyboard shortcuts for common actions.

The Dashboard officially supports the following web browsers:

- The last 20 major versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.
- The last 4 major versions of Safari.

If you don’t have access to the Dashboard, [activate your
account](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/activate).

## Primary navigation

In the Dashboard, the first section of the sidebar is where you can access and
act on information related to your balances, transactions, customers, and
products.

### Home

The [Home](https://dashboard.stripe.com/dashboard) page provides analytics and
charts about your business performance. It also surfaces important
notifications, like unresolved disputes or identity verifications. To customize
this page:

- Click **Add** under **Your overview**.
- Add or remove widgets by selecting or unselecting them.
- Click **Apply** to save your changes. You can also click **Edit** to remove
widgets.

### Balances

Use [Balances](https://dashboard.stripe.com/balance/overview) to see your Stripe
balance, including top-ups, payouts, and transaction history.

### Transactions

Use [Transactions](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments) to view all your
customer payments, including collected fees and transfers, and their status. You
can filter your transactions or export them if you want to use the data outside
of Stripe.

### Customers

Use [Customers](https://dashboard.stripe.com/customers) to create and manage
customer profiles. You can see information about your existing customers,
including their accounting details, using filters to locate specific customers.
Click a customer’s name to see more details, including subscriptions, payments,
payment methods, invoices, and quotes. To learn more, see [Create
customers](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/customer).

### Product catalog

The [Product catalog](https://dashboard.stripe.com/products) lets you create and
manage products and prices for your business. Click your product to see more
details. To learn more, see [Manage products and
prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/manage-prices).

## Shortcuts

Use the **Shortcuts** section to display your pinned and most recently visited
pages. After you visit a page, it apperas under this section, where you can pin
it.

## Products

Use the **Products** section to complete tasks, and view important product
information.

### Connect

If your business is a platform or marketplace, and you have [connected
accounts](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect), the Stripe Dashboard allows you
to also manage and support them. To learn more, see [Managing connected
accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard).

### Payments

Payments contains insights and tools for improving your payments performance,
including card authorization rates, fraud prevention, and dispute management.
Here, you can review insights and opportunities for improving your card
authorization rates, address any disputes, and manage fraudulent payments with
[Radar](https://dashboard.stripe.com/radar).

[Payment links](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payment-links) let you accept
payments or sell subscriptions without building an additional standalone website
or application. To learn more, see [Payment
Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links).

[Terminal readers](https://dashboard.stripe.com/setup/terminal/activate) are a
selection of pre-certified readers that accept EMV, contactless, and swiped
payments, encrypt sensitive card information, and return a token to your
application for payment confirmation. To learn more, see
[Terminal](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal).

### Billing

[Billing](https://dashboard.stripe.com/billing) lets you manage and configure
your billing and subscription-related information, such as creating,
customizing, and sending invoices to customers, and managing subscriptions,
applying discounts, and generating revenue reports. To learn more, see
[Billing](https://docs.stripe.com/billing).

### Reporting

[Reporting](https://dashboard.stripe.com/reporting/reports) allows you to export
historical transactions, payments, and payouts information from the Dashboard.
You can customize the reports by filtering and adding custom columns, and access
financial reports for an accounting-grade view. To learn more, see
[Reports](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-reports).

In addition to the general financial reporting available in the Dashboard,
Billing, Tax, and Radar offer product-specific analytics for additional
performance insights.

If you need more customized reporting,
[Sigma](https://dashboard.stripe.com/sigma/queries) lets you access and analyze
your data within an interactive SQL environment. While [Data
management](https://dashboard.stripe.com/data-management), lets you import
external data into Stripe. Learn more at [Stripe
data](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data).
