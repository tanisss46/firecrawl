Stripe\nusers in the United States can accept **ACH Direct Debit** from end customers\nwith US bank accounts using the Automated Clearing House (ACH) payments system\noperated by [Nacha](https://www.nacha.org/content/ach-network). A\n[Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect) platform that integrates ACH Direct\nDebit has more [advanced options\navailable](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/ach-direct-debit#fee-splitting). To\nbegin, determine whether:\n\n- Your customers [enter bank account\ninformation](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/ach-direct-debit#default-payment-method)\nto pay their invoices.\n- You [collect and verify bank account information\nupfront](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/ach-direct-debit#precollected-bank-information)\nand automatically process invoices.\n\n#### Note\n\nIf you give a customer an invoice link to pay a one-off invoice, Stripe\nautomatically saves their bank information allowing reuse on future invoices.\nYou can also add the bank customer’s information directly through the customer\ndetails page.\n\n## Set up ACH Direct Debit\n\nYou can either set ACH Direct Debit as a default payment method, or add it when\nyou [create an\ninvoice](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/dashboard#create-invoice).\n\nDashboardAPI\nTo set ACH Direct Debit as a default payment method type:\n\n- On the [Billing\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/invoice) page, under\n**Invoicing settings** > **Default payment methods**, click **Edit payment\nmethods**.\n- On the **Billing Payments** page, under **Bank debits**, click **Turn on** to\nenable **ACH Direct Debit** as a default payment method.\n\nYour customers can pay an invoice by using the [Hosted Invoice\nPage](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/hosted-invoice-page) to enter their bank\naccount information or select the default payment method. If there isn’t a\ndefault payment method, the invoice includes all available payment methods.\n\n## Pre-collected bank information\n\nYou can collect bank account information for future payments with **ACH Direct\nDebit**. After you add a customer’s ACH details, they must verify their payment\ninformation with microdeposits, which can take up to 2 days.\n\nDashboardAPI\nTo pre-collect a customer’s bank information:\n\n- On the [Customers](https://dashboard.stripe.com/customers) page, select a\ncustomer name.\n- On the customer page, under **Payment methods**, click the plus (**+**)\nsymbol, and select **Add US bank account**.\n- On the **Add a US bank account** page, enter the payment details, and click\n**Add US bank account**.\n- After verification, click the overflow menu () next to the payment method, and\nselect **Set as default**.\n\nWhenever you create a new invoice for your customer, select **Charge\nimmediately** to automatically charge the default payment method on file. For a\nfinalized invoice, you can also click **Charge customer** on the invoice details\npage, and select the saved ACH Direct Debit payment method to initiate the\ntransaction.\n\n## Payment completions\n\nFor any invoice with ACH Direct Debit enabled as a payment method, your customer\ncan enter their bank account information on the Hosted Invoice Page to start a\ndebit payment.\n\nYour customer must do the following to complete payment:\n\n- On the Hosted Invoice Page, select **US bank account**.\n- Search for and select the bank.\n- Initiate login with the bank and agree to the terms of service.\n- Select the bank account and click **Connect account**.\n- After successfully connecting the account, click **Back** to go to the\ninvoice.\n- Click **Pay** and agree to the terms of service.\n\n## Enhanced fee splitting Connect\n\nPayment methods (such as credit and debit cards) have a fixed percentage charged\nover the whole amount. But low cost payment methods (such as **ACH Direct\nDebit**) are usually capped. For platforms looking to dynamically reflect this\nfee arrangement to their businesses, Stripe recommends that you separate your\ncharges and transfers (as opposed to using the basic `application_fee_amount`\nparameter). With separate charges and transfers, your platform can transfer the\nbusiness’ share of funds minus the appropriate fee amount based on the payment\nmethod type.\n\n## Test the integration\n\nYou can test customer bank account entry through instant verification or\nmicrodeposits.\n\n### Instant verification\n\nYou can instantly verify a bank account in test mode. Refresh the page to view\nthe paid invoice.\n\n- Create an invoice in test mode.\n- Under **Payment collection**, select **Request payment in full** > **Manage\npayment methods**.\n- In the **Payment methods for this invoice** dialog, enable **ACH direct\ndebit**, and click **Save**.\n- Enter the invoice details, and click **Send invoice**.\n- On the invoice details page, under **Details**, click the **Payment page**\nlink.\n- On the Hosted Invoice Page, select **US bank account** > **Test Institution**.\n- Initiate login with the bank and agree to the terms of service.\n- Select the bank account and click **Connect account**.\n- After successfully connecting the account, click **Back** to go to the\ninvoice.\n- Click **Pay** and agree to the terms of service.\n\n### Microdeposits\n\nYou can manually verify bank accounts using microdeposits. In live mode, it\ntakes several days for the transaction to complete. But in test mode, the\ntransaction clears immediately and the invoice is paid.\n\n- Create an invoice in test mode.\n- Under **Payment collection**, select **Request payment in full** > **Manage\npayment methods**.\n- In the **Payment methods for this invoice** dialog, enable **ACH Direct\nDebit**, and click **Save**.\n- Enter the invoice details, and click **Send invoice**.\n- On the invoice details page, under **Details**, click the **Payment page**\nlink.\n- On the Hosted Invoice Page, select **US bank account**, and then click\n**Pay**.\n- Click **Enter bank details manually instead** to verify the bank account with\nmicrodeposits.\n- In the **Enter bank details** dialog, click **Use test account** to use a\n[test routing number and bank\naccount](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ach-direct-debit/accept-a-payment#test-account-numbers).\n- After successfully adding the account, click **Back** to go to the invoice.\n\nNext, finish initiating microdeposits in your Stripe account. You can expect an\nemail with instructions within 1-2 business days.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Payment methods](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/payment-methods)\n- [Hosted invoice page](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/hosted-invoice-page)\n- [Invoicing API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n\n## Links\n\n- [invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n- [ACH Direct Debit](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ach-direct-debit)\n- [Nacha](https://www.nacha.org/content/ach-network)\n- [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)\n- [create an\ninvoice](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/dashboard#create-invoice)\n- [Billing settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/invoice)\n- [Hosted Invoice Page](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/hosted-invoice-page)\n- [Customers](https://dashboard.stripe.com/customers)\n- [test routing number and bank\naccount](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ach-direct-debit/accept-a-payment#test-account-numbers)\n- [Payment methods](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/payment-methods)",
