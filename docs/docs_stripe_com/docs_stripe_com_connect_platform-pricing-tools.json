The following sections describe\nthe which platform configurations can use and access the platform pricing tools.\n\n### Requirements\n\nStripe applies pricing schemes to a payment when the payment meets all of the\nfollowing requirements:\n\n- The pricing scheme is enabled.\n- Stripe charges fees on the payment to your platform rather than the connected\naccount.\n- Your platform is permitted to charge app fees in the connected account’s\ncountry.\n- The payment doesn’t explicitly apply `application_fee or\ntransfer_data[amount]` parameters that override managed application fees.\n- The payment doesn’t use multi-capture.\n\nIn addition to the requirements, pricing schemes observe the following\nlimitations:\n\n- If you use Standard Connect with destination charges, you can’t override\npricing or implement different pricing schemes for individual connected\naccounts.\n- If a payment’s captured amount is less than the charge, the calculated fee is\nagainst the captured amount of the payment. For example, if only 5 USD is\ncaptured on a 10 USD charge, the fee is based on 5 USD.\n\n### Fee payer reference\n\nSupport for platform pricing tools also depends on your [funds\nflow](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges#types) configuration for your\nconnected accounts.\n\n- [Controller property\nconfiguration](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/migrate-to-controller-properties):-\nYou can use platform pricing tools to calculate application fees for all charges\nwhere the `controller.fees.payer` on the account is the Connect platform\n(`application`).\n- If a connected account uses destination charges, the platform is the fee payer\neven if you set `controller.fees.payer=account`.\n- Standard, Custom, or Express type configuration:- Configured pricing applies\nto destination charges.\n- Configured pricing doesn’t apply to direct charges unless the platform is on\n[IC+\npricing](https://support.stripe.com/questions/understanding-blended-interchange-pricing).\n\n## Eligibility for Instant Payouts\n\nStripe applies pricing schemes to an Instant Payout when:\n\n- Your platform controls pricing.\n- Your pricing scheme is enabled.\n- Your connected accounts are eligible for Instant Payouts.- When Stripe is\nliable for connected account losses, [Stripe determines connected account\neligibility](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts/instant-payouts#eligibility-and-daily-volume-limits)\nand volume limits. You must set up separate pricing rules for each Instant\nPayout currency for these connected accounts.\n- When your platform is liable for connected account losses, [your platform\nmanages\neligibility](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/instant-payouts#manage-risk-and-eligibility)\nfor connected accounts. These connected accounts must be in the same country as\nthe platform, so different currencies don’t apply.\n- A connected account must have an external account that [supports Instant\nPayouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts/instant-payouts-banks).\n\nConnected accounts can’t pay out more than their available balance. Instant\nPayout fees reflect in the\n[Payout](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payouts/object#payout_object-application_fee)\nobject to help with reporting and reconciliation. See\n[Transactions](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/application_fees) in the\nDashboard to view your collected fees. If an Instant Payout fails, we\nautomatically refund the application fee.\n\n#### Instant payout application fees API integration impact\n\nEnabling pricing tools for Instant Payouts without using the [Balance API\nnet-of-fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/balance/balance_object#balance_object-instant_available-net_available)\nattribute can break your API integration.\n\n## Subscriptions and invoices\n\nStripe also applies your pricing scheme-defined application fees to invoice and\nsubscription payments. As with standard purchase payments, when you apply an\nexplicit application fee to an invoice or subscription, that fee overrides any\nmatching scheme-defined fee.\n\n## Access platform pricing tools\n\nDifferent roles have different levels of access to pricing schemes.\n\nRoles that don’t have access to the platform’s default pricing can review the\nversion copied to the connected accounts. Connected accounts can’t view or edit\nany pricing schemes.\n\nPlatform accountConnected accounts\nThe following roles can access pricing schemes that apply to all connected\naccounts.\n\nRolePermissionsAdministratorRead and writeDeveloperNoneIAM AdminNoneConnect\nOnboarding AnalystNoneTransfer AnalystNoneAnalystNoneDispute AnalystNoneRefund\nAnalystNoneSupport SpecialistNoneSupport CommunicationsNoneTax AnalystNoneView\nOnlyNoneTop-ups SpecialistNone\n\n## Links\n\n- [platform pricing\ntools](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/platform_pricing)\n- [funds flow](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges#types)\n- [Controller property\nconfiguration](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/migrate-to-controller-properties)\n- [IC+\npricing](https://support.stripe.com/questions/understanding-blended-interchange-pricing)\n- [Stripe determines connected account\neligibility](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts/instant-payouts#eligibility-and-daily-volume-limits)\n- [your platform manages\neligibility](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/instant-payouts#manage-risk-and-eligibility)\n- [supports Instant\nPayouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts/instant-payouts-banks)\n-\n[Payout](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payouts/object#payout_object-application_fee)\n- [Transactions](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/application_fees)\n- [Balance API\nnet-of-fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/balance/balance_object#balance_object-instant_available-net_available)",
