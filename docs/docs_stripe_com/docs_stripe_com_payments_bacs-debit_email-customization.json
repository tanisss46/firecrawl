There\nare three types of Bacs Direct Debit email notifications you need to send in\ndifferent scenarios:\n\nEmailDescriptionConfirmation of signupSent when payment details are initially\ncollected and payment is to be collected more than one month laterAdvanced\nnoticeSent 2 days before payment is to be collected, for every payment\n*Confirmation of signup incorporating Advanced noticeSent when payment details\nare initially collected if the first payment is to be collected within one month\nof collecting the mandate\n* If you are charging a recurring amount where both the charge amount and\nschedule is unchanging then only one advanced notice email is required and it\nmust be sent before the first payment. This is often a reason why users choose\nto send their own Bacs email notifications: to reduce the overall number of\nemails they send their customers.\n\n## Approval process\n\nTo send your own Bacs Direct Debit notification emails, follow these steps:\n\n- [Contact us](https://support.stripe.com/contact) with screenshots of your\nemail designs for approval. This document lists out the requirements and gives\nexamples to follow when designing your emails.\n- Turn off Stripe emails in the [Stripe Dashboard email\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/emails).\n\n## Confirmation of signup\n\nBacs Direct Debit requires that the following information be included on a\nConfirmation of signup email notification:\n\n- A heading advising confirmation of the setup of a Direct Debit Instruction\n- Wording advising the payer to check the details contained in the email\n- The payer’s account name\n- The last 4 numbers of the payer’s account number with the leading digits\nmasked\n- The payer’s bank sort code\n- Your customized Business Display Name\n- Your contact telephone number and email address\n- Advice of right to cancel\n- The [mandate\nreference](https://docs.stripe.com/api/mandates/object#mandate_object-payment_method_details-bacs_debit-reference)\n- The unedited [Stripe Direct Debit\nGuarantee](https://stripe.com/legal/bacs-direct-debit-guarantee), including the\nDirect Debit logo\n\nThe Confirmation of signup email must be sent as soon as you have collected\npayment details from your customer.
