You can build an app to:\n\n- Create and modify Stripe data, such as customer information, orders, and\ninvoices\n- Sync Stripe data into other systems\n- Add customizations to the Stripe user interface\n\nFor more examples of what you can build with Stripe Apps, see [Sample\napps](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/sample-apps).\n\nThe basic components of Stripe Apps:\n\nStripe API\n\nUI extension\n\nYour servers\n\nGet eventsPush data to StripeThe basic components of Stripe Apps\nUsing Stripe Apps, you can create custom apps for your own account, or you can\nmake your apps available to other Stripe users through the [Stripe App\nMarketplace](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/distribution-options).\n\nUse this guide to learn about the three types of Stripe Apps you can build and\nhow to use permissions to get access to the information your app needs.\n\n## Full-stack applications\n\nMost Stripe Apps have two components:\n\n- A frontend component in the Stripe Dashboard, using UI extensions\n- A backend component that’s responsible for saving the state and performing\nbackground operations\n\n![The components of a full-stack\napplication](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/stripe-apps-full-stack-app.2a8251568ced0f8fa10193d8150aad23.png)\n\nThe components of a full-stack application\n\nAuthentication between an app’s UI and its corresponding backend services works\nby using either [OAuth](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/pkce-oauth-flow) or\na [shared\nsecret](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/build-backend#authenticate-ui-to-backend).\n\n#### Note\n\nWhen building a full-stack Stripe App, first see [How UI extensions\nwork](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/how-ui-extensions-work) and then\n[Server-side logic](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/build-backend) as\nneeded.\n\n## Backend-only applications\n\nYou can build a Stripe App without a UI. For example, an app might collect order\ndata from Stripe and send that data to another service for fulfillment.\n\nThe components of a backend-only application:\n\nStripe API\n\nYour servers\n\nGet eventsPush data to StripeComponents of a back-end only app\nFor more information on what you can do with the backend of your app, see\n[Server-side logic](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/build-backend).\n\n## Frontend-only applications\n\nYou can build an app that extends the Stripe Dashboard and doesn’t include any\nadditional backend functionality. A Stripe app can consist solely of a UI. With\nUI extensions, you create a custom UI and control where and how it appears in\nthe Stripe Dashboard.\n\n![The components of a frontend-only\napplication](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/stripe-apps-frontend-only-app.f8a4611260e353f1d19028ad5efda70f.png)\n\nThe components of a frontend-only application\n\nFrontend-only applications using UI extensions are a good choice if:\n\n- Your application doesn’t need to communicate with a backend service.\n- Your application only needs to communicate with the Stripe API on behalf of a\nuser signed in to the Stripe Dashboard.\n- Your application uses an OAuth provider to authenticate users and interact\nwith other services.\n\nFor more information, see [How UI extensions\nwork](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/how-ui-extensions-work).\n\n## Application permissions\n\nAll Stripe Apps, regardless of type, require explicit permission to access data.\nThese permissions fall into two categories:\n\n- Stripe permissions, which determine what Stripe objects the application can\nread and write\n- Third-party permissions, which determine what other services have access to a\nuser’s Stripe data\n\nThe [app manifest](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/reference/app-manifest)\nstores the Stripe and third-party permissions granted to an app.\n\n### Stripe permissions\n\nBefore an app can access any Stripe data, you must grant permission for that\ndata to the app. See a complete list of all\n[permissions](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/reference/permissions).\n\nPermissions apply in several ways:\n\n- Apps can listen for [webhook events](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) on a\nStripe object only if they have permission to read the object.\n- Apps can make Stripe API calls only if that API grants permission to the\napplication.\n- When an app calls a Stripe API from a UI extension, both the app and the\nsigned-in user must have permission to access the API.\n\nUI extensions call the Stripe API on behalf of the signed in user. The app can’t\naccess data or perform actions that the signed in user can’t also do. If the\nsigned in user has permissions that the app didn’t request, the app is still\nunable to read or write that data. However, if the app has permissions that the\nsigned in user doesn’t have, the app can still perform the action, if the app\nhas permission to do so. In this case, the backend service is responsible for\nchecking the user’s permissions.\n\n### Third-party services\n\nStripe Apps must also explicitly list the URLs for any non-Stripe services that\ncould potentially receive Stripe data.\n\nIn UI extensions, accessible URLs are enforced by applying a Content Security\nPolicy (CSP). This policy causes any `fetch` call to fail unless it’s explicitly\nlisted in the [app\nmanifest](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/reference/app-manifest).\n\n### Granting permissions\n\nThe [app manifest](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/reference/app-manifest)\nstores all permissions for an application. To grant permissions to a specific\nStripe object or backend service, use the `stripe app grant` command when you\nupload the app. For more information, see a list of all\n[permissions](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/reference/permissions).\n\n## See also\n\n- [Create an app](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/create-app)\n- [Stripe App CLI reference](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/reference/cli)\n- [How UI extensions\nwork](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/how-ui-extensions-work)\n- [Server-side logic](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/build-backend)\n- [Authentication flows](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/pkce-oauth-flow)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Sample apps](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/sample-apps)\n- [Stripe App\nMarketplace](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/distribution-options)\n- [OAuth](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/pkce-oauth-flow)\n- [shared\nsecret](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/build-backend#authenticate-ui-to-backend)\n- [How UI extensions\nwork](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/how-ui-extensions-work)\n- [Server-side logic](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/build-backend)\n- [app manifest](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/reference/app-manifest)\n- [permissions](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/reference/permissions)\n- [webhook events](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks)\n- [Create an app](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/create-app)\n- [Stripe App CLI reference](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/reference/cli)",
