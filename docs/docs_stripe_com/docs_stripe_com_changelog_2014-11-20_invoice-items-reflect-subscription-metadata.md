# Invoice items now reflect the metadata for their associated subscription, rather than planBreaking changes

## What’s new

Updates the `metadata` property of the `Invoice Item` object with a type of
`subscription` to show the subscription’s metadata. Previously, it showed the
plan’s metadata.

## Impact

By showing the subscription’s metadata instead of the plan’s metadata, you can
access custom fields and data that are directly related to the individual
subscription, rather than the more general plan information.
