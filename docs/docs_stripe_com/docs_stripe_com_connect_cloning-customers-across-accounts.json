Support for it might end\nwithout notice, so if you use this feature, update your integration to use the\ncurrent process for reusing payment information across connected accounts. For\nmore information, see [Share payment methods across multiple\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges-multiple-accounts#clone-and-create-direct-charges).\n\nFor some business models, it’s helpful to reuse your customers’ payment\ninformation across connected accounts. For example, a customer who makes a\npurchase from one of your connected sellers shouldn’t need to re-enter their\ncredit card or bank account details to purchase from another seller.\n\nWith [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect), you can accomplish this by\nfollowing three steps:\n\n- [Storing\ncustomers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/cloning-customers-across-accounts#storing-customers),\nwith a payment method, on the platform account.\n- [Creating\ntokens](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/cloning-customers-across-accounts#creating-tokens)\nto clone the payment method when it’s time to charge the customer on behalf of a\nconnected account.\n- [Creating\ncharges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/cloning-customers-across-accounts#creating-charges)\nusing the new tokens.\n[Storing\ncustomers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/cloning-customers-across-accounts#storing-customers)\nWhen not cloning payment methods, you save the Stripe [Customer\nobjects](https://docs.stripe.com/api#customers) on each individual connected\nStripe account. When cloning payment methods, you instead save them on the\nplatform Stripe account.\n\nThis is an [API call](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_customer) but be sure\nto use your own secret and publishable keys instead of the connect account’s.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n --data-urlencode email=\"paying.user@example.com\" \\\n -d source=tok_mastercard\n```\n\n[Creating\ntokens](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/cloning-customers-across-accounts#creating-tokens)\n#### Caution\n\nIf your platform uses the Sources API, you must [create a Source from that\ncustomer](https://docs.stripe.com/sources/connect#cloning-card-sources) rather\nthan creating a token. If your platform uses the [Payment Methods\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods), you must [create a\nPaymentMethod from that\ncustomer](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges-multiple-accounts#clone-and-create-direct-charges).\nAfter following either of these guides, proceed to [Creating\ncharges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/cloning-customers-across-accounts#creating-charges)\nwithout creating a token.\n\nWhen you’re ready to create a charge on a connected account using a customer\nsaved on your platform account, [create a new\ntoken](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_card_token) for that purpose. You’ll\nneed:\n\n- The Stripe account ID of the connected account (for example,\n`acct_sGvLiEp1gxuTGXsT`) that you’re creating the charge for\n- The ID of the customer in your platform account (for example,\n`cus_RWTsMUKl78vvTi`) being charged\n- The card or bank account ID for that customer, if you want to charge a\nspecific card or bank account rather than the default\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/tokens \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -H \"Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}\" \\\n -d customer={{CUSTOMER_ID}}\n```\n\n[Creating\ncharges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/cloning-customers-across-accounts#creating-charges)\nWith the token generated in the previous step, [attach this token to a\ncustomer](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_customer) on the connected account.\n\n#### Caution\n\nCharges that are made on the cloned customer aren’t reflected on the original\ncustomer. This feature is intended for multiple connected accounts that need to\ncharge the same user.\n\n#### Caution\n\nIf your platform uses the [Payment Methods\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods), you must pass the\npayment method ID as the `payment_method` parameter instead of passing the\n`source` parameter.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -H \"Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}\" \\\n -d source={{TOKEN_ID}}\n```\n\nThen, use the customer ID (for example, `cus_iq7QTdB67h4dwh`) and the payment\nmethod ID (for example, `card_x6zUJjN1r4IpL5`) returned by the\n`customers.create` call to charge the customer.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -H \"Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}\" \\\n -d amount=999 \\\n -d currency=usd \\\n -d \"payment_method_types[]\"=card \\\n -d customer={{CUSTOMER_ID}} \\\n -d payment_method={{PAYMENT_METHOD_ID}}\n```\n\n## See also\n\n- [Creating charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges)\n- [Creating direct charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Share payment methods across multiple\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges-multiple-accounts#clone-and-create-direct-charges)\n- [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)\n- [creating direct charges on connected\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges)\n- [Customer objects](https://docs.stripe.com/api#customers)\n- [API call](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_customer)\n- [create a Source from that\ncustomer](https://docs.stripe.com/sources/connect#cloning-card-sources)\n- [Payment Methods API](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods)\n- [Creating\ncharges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/cloning-customers-across-accounts#creating-charges)\n- [create a new token](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_card_token)\n- [Creating charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges)",
