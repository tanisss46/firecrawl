  "content": "# Moving money with Treasury using ReceivedCredit objects\n\n## Learn how to move money into a Treasury financial account from another Treasury financial account or bank account.\n\nWhen funds move into a financial account, Stripe creates a corresponding\n[ReceivedCredit](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/received_credits) object\non the account. A `ReceivedCredit` contains information on how the funds were\nsent and from what account, where possible. You can send funds to a financial\naccount with the accountâ€™s routing and account numbers for `ach` and\n`us_domestic_wire`, or the financial account ID for transfers between financial\naccounts.\n\nWhen the origin of the funds is another Treasury financial account, the\n`ReceivedCredit` contains a `linked_flows.source_flow` reference to the\noriginating money movement. In this case, the source `OutboundPayment` has\n`stripe` as its `network` value.\n\n## Retrieve a ReceivedCredit\n\nUse `GET /v1/treasury/received_credits/{{RECEIVED_CREDIT_ID}}` to retrieve the\n[ReceivedCredit](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/received_credits) with the\nspecified ID.\n\nThe following request retrieves the `ReceivedCredit` with the specified ID. The\nresponse for this request includes expanded [Transaction\nobject](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transactions) details.\n\n```\ncurl -G\nhttps://api.stripe.com/v1/treasury/received_credits/{{RECEIVED_CREDIT_ID}} \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -H \"Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}\" \\\n -d \"expand[]\"=transaction\n```\n\nIf successful, the response provides the requested `ReceivedCredit` object. Some\nof the parameters in the response have additional details that are only returned\nwhen you add them as values to the `expand[]` parameter of your request. The\nfields that you can expand have an `Expandable` comment in the following\nresponse example. See [Expanding\nResponses](https://docs.stripe.com/api/expanding_objects) to learn more about\nexpanding object responses.\n\n```\n{\n \"id\": \"{{RECEIVED_CREDIT_ID}}\",\n \"object\": \"received_credit\",\n \"livemode\": true | false,\n \"created\": \"{{Timestamp}}\",\n // The FinancialAccount that received the funds\n \"financial_account\": \"{{FINANCIAL_ACCOUNT_ID}}\", // Expandable\n \"amount\": 1000,\n \"currency\": \"usd\",\n // The description of this movement sent by the originator\n```\n\nSee all 79 lines\n## List ReceivedCredits\n\nUse `GET /v1/treasury/received_credits` to retrieve all of the `ReceivedCredits`\nfor the financial account with the ID of the required `financial_account`\nparameter. You can filter the list with the standard list parameters, by\n`status`, or by `linked_flows.source_flow_type`.\n\n```\n{\n // Standard list parameters\n \"limit\", \"starting_after\", \"ending_before\",\n // Filter by FinancialAccount (required)\n \"financial_account\": \"{{FINANCIAL_ACCOUNT_ID}}\",\n // Filter by status\n \"status\": \"succeeded\" | \"failed\",\n // Filter by `source_flow_type`\n \"linked_flows.source_flow_type\": nil | \"payout\" | \"outbound_payment\"\n}\n\n```\n\nThe following request retrieves the `ReceivedCredits` that have a status of\n`failed` for the specified financial account.\n\n```\ncurl -G https://api.stripe.com/v1/treasury/received_credits \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -H \"Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}\" \\\n -d financial_account={{FINANCIAL_ACCOUNT_ID}} \\\n -d status=failed\n```\n\nIf successful, the response includes the\n[ReceivedCredit](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/received_credits) objects\nthat match the criteria specified in the request.\n\n## Test ReceivedCredits\n\nUse `POST /v1/test_helpers/treasury/received_credits` to simulate receiving\nfunds in a financial account. To simulate a bank transfer from an account\noutside of Stripe to your financial account, set\n`initiating_payment_method_details` to the values of the external bank account,\nand set `network` to `ach` or `us_domestic_wire`.\n\nThe following request creates a test mode `ReceivedCredit` from an external bank\naccount using an `OutboundPayment` between two financial accounts on the same\nplatform.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/test_helpers/treasury/received_credits \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -H \"Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}\" \\\n -d financial_account={{DESTINATION_FINANCIAL_ACCOUNT_ID}} \\\n -d network=ach \\\n -d amount=1234 \\\n -d currency=usd\n```\n\nIf successful, the response returns a `ReceivedCredit` object. The following is\nan example of a response for a bank transfer.\n\n```\n{\n \"financial_account\": \"{{FINANCIAL_ACCOUNT_ID}}\",\n \"network\": \"ach\",\n \"amount\": \"1234\",\n \"currency\": \"usd\",\n \"description\": \"Test\",\n \"source_details\": {\n \"type\": \"aba\",\n \"aba\": {\n \"country\": \"US\",\n \"routing_number\": \"12341234\",\n \"account_number\": \"0123456789\",\n \"account_holder_name\": \"Jenny Rosen\",\n }\n }\n}\n```\n\n## ReceivedCredit webhooks\n\nStripe emits the following `ReceivedCredit` events to your\n[webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) endpoint:\n\n- `treasury.received_credit.created` on `ReceivedCredit` creation.\n- `treasury.received_credit.{{new_status}}` when an `ReceivedCredit` changes\nstatus. Available status value options include:-\n`treasury.received_credit.succeeded`\n- `treasury.received_credit.failed`\n\n## Links\n\n- [ReceivedCredit](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/received_credits)\n- [Transaction object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transactions)\n- [Expanding Responses](https://docs.stripe.com/api/expanding_objects)\n- [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks)",
