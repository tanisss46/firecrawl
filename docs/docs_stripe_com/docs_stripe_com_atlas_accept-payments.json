We also automatically add your EIN to your Stripe account.\n\n## Charge customers immediately after incorporating\n\nYou can start accepting US card payments on Stripe before receiving your EIN.\nStripe offers no-code payment options like [Payment\nLinks](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links) and\n[Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing). Atlas companies receive one year\nof free payment processing on Stripe, up to 100,000 USD in revenue.\n\nTo activate Stripe Payments:\n\n- Wait for your company to be incorporated in Delaware, which typically takes\n1–2 business days after submitting your Atlas application.\n- Click the link under the **Charge Your First Customers** panel in your Atlas\nDashboard or go to [Activate Stripe\nPayments](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/onboarding).\n- Atlas automatically pre-fills the payment application with information you\nprovided in your Atlas application. To complete the application, you need to\nprovide a US phone number and enter a personal ID number in the business\nrepresentative section (you can use your government-issued ID number).\n\nIf you need help getting a US phone number, our partners in the **Perks**\nsection of the Atlas Dashboard can assist you.\n\n## Receive payouts\n\nYou can use [Payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts) to transfer your Stripe\nbalance to your bank account only after receiving your EIN. Once your EIN is\navailable, you can also access additional payment methods beyond US card\npayments.\n\nAtlas gets your EIN within 1–2 business days when founders provide a:\n\n- US company address\n- Phone number\n- US social security number\n\nIf any of these details are missing, it might take 35–45 business days for Atlas\nto get your EIN.\n\n## Choose your payments product\n\nAtlas startups often start by using [Payment\nLinks](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payment-links) to accept payments without\nwriting code. These are full payment pages you can create in a few clicks, and\nshare with customers by using a link. Stripe also offers other [no-code payment\noptions](https://docs.stripe.com/no-code) to help you start accepting payments.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Atlas Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/atlas)\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n- [Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing)\n- [Activate Stripe Payments](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/onboarding)\n- [Payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts)\n- [Payment Links](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payment-links)\n- [no-code payment options](https://docs.stripe.com/no-code)",
