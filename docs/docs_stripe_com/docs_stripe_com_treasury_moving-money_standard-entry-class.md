# ACH Standard Entry Class (SEC) handling

## Learn how SEC codes are determined for ACH transfers.

Each ACH transaction has an associated Standard Entry Class (SEC) code that
describes the accounts involved and how the transaction was authorized.

Stripe Treasury determines the SEC code based on whether the account receiving
the ACH entry is owned by a company or an individual. You specify the account
holder type in
