  "content": "# Export account activity to QuickBooks\n\n## Download an export of your Stripe account data suitable for import into your desktop QuickBooks.\n\nIn addition to the CSV-formatted\n[reports](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-reports) that are available for export\nin the Dashboard, information about payments, refunds, fees, and\n[payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts) is also available in a [QuickBooks\nDesktop](http://quickbooks.intuit.com/)-compatible IIF file. You can download\nthis within the Dashboard’s [Legacy exports\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/legacy_exports).\n\nYou can also use [Accounting Stripe\nApps](https://marketplace.stripe.com/categories/accounting) to automate your\nbookkeeping, keep your financial data updated, and eliminate the need for manual\ndata entry.\n\n## QuickBooks accounts\n\nThe exported IIF file creates the following nine accounts in QuickBooks, if they\ndon’t already exist. All of the Stripe-created accounts are prefaced by\n**Stripe** to make them easy to locate and identify.\n\nNameTypeDescriptionStripe AccountBankAll charges, refunds, and payoutsStripe\nChecking AccountBankRepresents your actual bank account to which Stripe sends\npayoutsStripe Payment Processing FeesExpenseProcessing fees for all\nchargesStripe ReturnsIncomeAll refundsStripe SalesIncomeAll charges minus\nprocessing feesStripe Third-Party AccountTax-Related ExpenseEvery transfer to a\nthird-partyStripe Other FeesExpenseAdjustmentsStripe Processing Fees\nAdjExpenseAdjustmentsStripe Other IncomeIncomeAdjustments\nIf these accounts already exist but are of a different type than what you see in\nthe exports file, QuickBooks presents an error about being unable to change the\naccount type. If this occurs edit the conflicting accounts to have the same type\nas the IIF file.\n\n#### Note\n\nAlways back up your QuickBooks data before importing new information.\n\n## Date format and timezones\n\nThe IIF file formats the date as MM/DD/YYYY. QuickBooks uses the same date\nformat as your operating system. If this differs from the exported file, you can\ntemporarily change your operating system’s date format:\n\n- Set the date format in your operating system to MM/DD/YYYY.\n- Import the QuickBooks IIF file.\n- Change your operating system’s date format back to your preferred style.\n\nYour account’s [timezone setting](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/account)\nis used for the date range of the IIF export.\n\n## Merging QuickBooks accounts\n\nYou may want to merge one or more of these created accounts with an existing\nQuickBooks account. In particular, you may want to merge the **Stripe Checking\nAccount**, which represents the bank where your Stripe payouts are sent, with\nyour actual banking account in QuickBooks:\n\n- Select **Lists > Chart of Accounts** to view all of your accounts.\n- Make sure both accounts being merged are on the same level (that is, both can\nbe sub-accounts or both can be primary level accounts).\n- Select the account you are no longer going to use (for example, **Stripe\nChecking Account**).\n- Click **Account > Edit Account** at the bottom of the **Chart of Accounts**\nwindow.\n- Change the name of this account to exactly match the name of the other account\n(the one you’ll be keeping).\n- Click **Save**.\n\nYou’re then prompted about merging the account with an existing one. Click\n**Yes** to proceed with the merge, **No** to cancel. The records in the renamed\naccount will be merged into the retained account. Accounts need to be re-merged\nafter each new import.\n\n## Considerations for Connect platforms with Custom accounts\n\nPlatform owners with Custom accounts can view the Dashboard of connected Stripe\naccounts. From the connected account’s Dashboard, export an IIF file in the same\nway as a normal Stripe account.\n\n[Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect) platforms creating charges on behalf\nof connected accounts that need to generate 1099s for Custom accounts must\ndeclare the correct tax-line mapping of the **Stripe Third-Party Account**. This\nexpense account is given an initial tax-line mapping of 1099-MISC: Nonemployee\ncompensation.\n\nFor QuickBooks to use **Stripe Third-Party Account** data for the generation of\n1099s, you must first enable this feature within QuickBooks’ preferences.\n\n- Select **Preferences > Tax: 1099 > Company Preferences** within QuickBooks.\n- Click on the link in **If you want to map your accounts to boxes on Form\n1099-MISC, click here**.\n- In the resulting QuickBooks 1099 Wizard, select **Stripe Third-Party Account**\nunder **Accounts used for 1099**.\n- Under **Apply payments to this 1099 box** for **Stripe Third-Party Account**,\nselect **Box 7: Nonemployee compensation**.\n\n## Links\n\n- [third-party accounting\nintegrations](https://stripe.partners/?f_category=accounting)\n- [reports](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-reports)\n- [payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts)\n- [QuickBooks Desktop](http://quickbooks.intuit.com/)\n- [Legacy exports settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/legacy_exports)\n- [Accounting Stripe Apps](https://marketplace.stripe.com/categories/accounting)\n- [timezone setting](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/account)\n- [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)",
