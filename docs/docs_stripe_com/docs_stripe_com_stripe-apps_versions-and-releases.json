A *release* is a version of your app that you decide to\npublish—either to your own account or on the [Stripe App\nMarketplace](https://marketplace.stripe.com/) after passing app review.\n\n## Versions overview\n\nThe `version` property in the [app\nmanifest](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/reference/app-manifest) lets you\nspecify the version of your app. Stripe doesn’t enforce a specific versioning\nschema for apps, but we recommend following an established pattern, like\n[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).\n\nStripe users who install your app don’t have to think about the version number.\nStripe automatically upgrades them to the latest release of an app. The app\nfunctions in a similar manner to apps updating automatically on your phone. The\nonly exception is cases where the permissions scope changes. If you change the\npermissions, users of your app are prompted to re-authorize your app and its new\npermissions.\n\n## How to upload a new app version\n\n- Change the `version` property in the [app\nmanifest](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/reference/app-manifest).\n- Upload the new app version to Stripe. Follow the same [upload\nprocess](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/upload-install-app) that you used\nwhen creating an app.\n\n## Changing between app versions in test mode\n\nYou can change between different app versions in test mode before creating a\nrelease.\n\n- In the Stripe Dashboard, go to [Apps](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apps).\n- Select the app you want to create a new version for, and view **App Details**.\n- In the version history table, click the overflow menu () of the new version.\n- Select **Install in test mode** and complete the installation.\n\n## Releases overview\n\nTo distribute your app in live mode for users, create a new release. You can\npublish it to your own account or to the [App\nMarketplace](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/publish-app). To be listed in\nthe App Marketplace, releases must go through [App\nReview](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/review-requirements).\n\n## How to create a new release\n\n- In the Stripe Dashboard, go to [Apps](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apps).\n- Select the app you want to create a new version for, and view **App Details**.\n- Click **Create new release**.\n- Follow the steps to create a new release.\n\nWhen your release passes app review, all users are automatically upgraded to the\nlatest released version.\n\n## How to remove an app listing or change a release\n\nApp releases can only be fixed forward. To remove an app listing or change an\napp release that had accidental changes, bump the app version and make a new\nrelease of the app.\n\nSince we don’t enforce a versioning structure, an incremental release is any\nrelease created after the current live version. For example, if version 2.0.0\nwas uploaded before version 1.0.0, version 2.0.0 won’t be available to create a\nrelease.\n\nTo remove an app or an app release from Stripe, [contact Stripe\nSupport](https://support.stripe.com/).\n\n## See also\n\n- [Upload your app](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/upload-install-app)\n- [Publish your app](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/publish-app)\n- [App review\nrequirements](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/review-requirements)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Stripe App Marketplace](https://marketplace.stripe.com)\n- [app manifest](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/reference/app-manifest)\n- [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/)\n- [upload process](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/upload-install-app)\n- [Apps](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apps)\n- [App Marketplace](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/publish-app)\n- [App Review](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/review-requirements)\n- [contact Stripe Support](https://support.stripe.com/)",
