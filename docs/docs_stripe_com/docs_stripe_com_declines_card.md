# Card declines

## Learn about card declines and how to lower your decline rate.

Card payments can fail for a variety of reasons. Some of the most common are:

- **Insufficient customer funds:** If a customer has insufficient customer funds
or credit, the card issuer declines the transaction. To help minimize declines
due to insufficient funds, consider adding a [Buy Now, Pay Later
(BNPL)](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/buy-now-pay-later) option.
- **Incorrect card data:** If a customer enters an incorrect card number, CVV,
or expiration date, the card issuer might decline the transaction. In these
cases, request your customer to re-enter their card information.
- **Fraudulent activity:** If a card issuer suspects fraudulent activity, which
can be triggered by large purchases or a large volume of transactions over a
short period of time, they might decline payments. Your customer must resolve
this issue by communicating with their issuing bank and confirming their
identity.

#### Stripe Sigma

Use [Stripe Sigma](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data) to analyze your decline
rate. Our interactive SQL reporting environment offers prebuilt queries for this
purpose. To investigate declines outside Sigma, consider the `Card` object
[fingerprints](https://docs.stripe.com/api/cards/object#card_object-fingerprint)
instead of charge IDs to exclude repeat attempts.

## Card declines

When your customer’s card issuer receives a charge, their automated systems and
models decide whether to authorize it. These tools analyze signals such as
spending habits, account balance, and card data including expiration date,
address information, and CVC.

If the card issuer declines a payment, Stripe shares some of the decline
information we receive. This information is available in the Dashboard and
through the API. Sometimes, issuers provide specific explanations, such as an
incorrect card number or low funds. We show these as [decline
codes](https://docs.stripe.com/declines/codes).

Card issuer’s categorize most declines as generic
([generic_decline](https://docs.stripe.com/declines/codes#generic_decline)),
making the exact decline reason unclear. If the card information is correct,
request your customer to contact their card issuer to understand why a
transaction was declined. For privacy and security reasons, card issuers discuss
the specifics of a decline only with their cardholders.

### Network codes

Whenever there’s a decline, the card issuer provides two types of network codes:

- **Network decline code:** The card’s issuing bank provides this 2-4 digit
code. When Stripe doesn’t receive a response code from the card network for a
declined charge, the `network_decline_code` field is null. The meaning of a code
differs based on the card network. For this reason, take the card’s brand into
consideration when interpreting the code.
- **Network advice code:** The card’s issuing bank provides this 2-4 digit code.
The code offers guidance on managing a decline. When Stripe doesn’t receive a
response code from the card network for a declined charge, the
`network_advice_code` field is null. The meaning of a code differs based on the
card network. For this reason, take the card’s brand into consideration when
interpreting the code. Mastercard refers to network advice codes as Merchant
Advice Codes (MAC).

## Reduce card declines

You can typically resolve card issuer declines resulting from inaccurate card
details (such as an incorrect card number or expiration date) by asking your
customers to correct the error or use a different card or payment method. For
example, [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout) provides feedback
to the customer when a card declines and allows them to try again.

To avoid declines that stem from suspected fraudulent activity, request your
customers to provide their CVC and postal code during checkout. The impact of
other data that you gather, such as the full billing address, might vary by card
brand and country. If you continue to see elevated decline rates, Stripe
recommends collecting extra customer information. You can also implement [3D
Secure](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure) to authenticate payment,
which can lower decline rates in countries that support it.

For a clear insight into why the card issuer declined the card during generic or
[do_not_honor](https://docs.stripe.com/declines/codes#do_not_honor) declines,
examine the associated data. For example, if CVC or Address Verification Service
(AVS) checks fail when your customer adds a card, request your customer to
verify both of these details before initiating another charge.

If you notice that a customer is using a card issued in one country while
operating from an IP address in another, it might be a legitimate decline due to
possible unauthorized card use. However, exceptions can occur, particularly when
customers are traveling internationally and use their cards from various
locations.

### Card type restrictions

Some customers find that their card has restrictions on the types of purchasable
items. FSA or HSA cards are often limited to certain types of businesses (for
example, healthcare providers), so card issuer’s decline any other type of
purchase. Additionally, some card issuers might not allow purchases from certain
countries or outside of their own. In either case, your customer must contact
their card issuer to inquire about potential restrictions.

### Geographic location impacts

If your customers use cards issued in a different country than where you
registered your Stripe account, they might see an increased rate of declines. To
resolve this, your customer must contact their issuing bank to authorize the
charge. If you have a global customer base with concentrations in various
locations, you might want to set up Stripe accounts in larger markets, or in
regions that encounter higher decline rates. This allows you to process charges
locally.

## Declined card retries

When a payment gets declined, Stripe offers a reason for the decline and briefly
suggests a resolution path.

![Declined payment due to insufficient
funds](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/declined-payment-dashboard.5fb1d634ab6b87c89db2c0078e076393.png)

Declined payment due to insufficient funds

If you’re a [Stripe Billing](https://docs.stripe.com/billing) user, you can
create a custom retry schedule for subscriptions. Use [Smart
Retries](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/automatic-collection#smart-retries)
to choose the best times to retry failed payment attempts. Be aware that card
networks limit the number of times you can reattempt a single charge. We
recommend a maximum of eight retries for charges that permit retries. Card
issuers might see creating additional retries as potential fraud, which can
result in increased declines for legitimate charges.

In the API, the
[reason](https://docs.stripe.com/api#charge_object-outcome-reason) in the
[outcome](https://docs.stripe.com/api#charge_object-outcome) uses [decline
codes](https://docs.stripe.com/declines/codes) to tell you why the card issuer
declined the authorization. The
[advice_code](https://docs.stripe.com/api#charge_object-outcome-advice-code) in
the `outcome` tells you what to do next.

Advice codeDescriptionNext steps`do_not_try_again` The card was declined and you
shouldn’t use it again for the same transaction.See the [decline
code](https://docs.stripe.com/declines/codes) for the reason why the card issuer
declined the authorization. Your customer might need to contact their card
issuer for more information.`try_again_later` The card issuer declined the
transaction, but you can [retry
it](https://docs.stripe.com/declines/card#retrying-issuer-declines).Ask the
customer to attempt the payment again. If subsequent payments are declined, the
customer needs to contact their card issuer for more
information.`confirm_card_data` The card issuer declined the transaction because
some of the provided information is incorrect.See the [decline
code](https://docs.stripe.com/declines/codes) for the reason why the card issuer
declined authorization. The customer needs to validate the information on their
card.
## Manage declines programmatically

There are several ways to programmatically handle declines:

- Retrieve the
[last_payment_error.decline_code](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-last_payment_error-decline_code)
property from the
[PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object) object to
see why the card issuer declined the payment attempt.
- Iterate over the PaymentIntent’s [attempted
charges](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents/verifying-status#identifying-charges)
and inspect the [failure
message](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-failure_message).
- Use
[webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents/verifying-status#webhooks)
to monitor PaymentIntent status updates. For example, the
`payment_intent.payment_failed` event triggers when a payment attempt is
unsuccessful.

You might also need to manage additional payment failure situations such as when
your customer is present (on-session) or absent (off-session) during your
checkout process. As you develop your integration, Stripe advises treating all
possible API exceptions, including unexpected
[errors](https://docs.stripe.com/error-codes).

#### Note

[Stripe Billing](https://docs.stripe.com/billing) handles many of these payment
failure scenarios with features like [Automatic
Collection](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/automatic-collection) and [Hosted
Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/hosted-invoice-page).

### On-session declines

If your customer is present in your website or application’s checkout flow,
prompt them to try their payment method again or ask for a new payment method.

### Off-session declines

If your customer isn’t available to make a payment or update a payment method,
notify them (for example, send them an email or in-app notification) to visit
your website or application. If your business is affected by regulations like
[Strong Customer
Authentication](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication), payment
attempts might also require authentication and fail with an
[authentication_required](https://docs.stripe.com/declines/codes) decline code.
For more information on handling these scenarios, see [off-session payments with
saved
cards](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-during-payment?platform=web#charge-saved-payment-method).
