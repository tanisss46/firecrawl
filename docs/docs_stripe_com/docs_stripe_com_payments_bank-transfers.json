  "content": "# Bank transfer payments\n\n## Learn about bank transfers and managing payments with the customer balance.\n\nAvailable in: \nBank transfers provide a safe way for customers to send money over bank rails.\nWhen accepting bank transfers with Stripe, you provide customers with a virtual\nbank account number that they can push money to from their own online bank\ninterface or in-person bank branch. Stripe uses this virtual account number to\nautomate reconciliation and prevent exposing your real account details to\ncustomers.\n\n## Bank transfer methods\n\nStripe supports the following bank transfer methods:\n\n- JPY bank transfers in Japan\n- GBP bank transfers in the UK\n- EUR bank transfers in the UK, US, and SEPA countries\n- MXN bank transfers in Mexico\n- USD bank transfers in the US, UK, and SEPA countries\n\nPlease [contact us](https://support.stripe.com/contact) to request another bank\ntransfer method. Learn more about [country and currency\nsupport](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/payment-method-support#country-currency-support).\n\n## Get started\n\nYou don’t have to integrate Bank Transfers and other payment methods\nindividually. If you use our front-end products, Stripe automatically determines\nthe most relevant payment methods to display. Go to the [Stripe\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and enable\nBank Transfers. To get started with one of our hosted UIs, follow a quickstart:\n\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart): Our prebuilt, hosted\ncheckout page.\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart): Our drop-in UI\ncomponents.\n\n### Other payment products\n\nThe following Stripe products also let you add Bank Transfers from the\nDashboard:\n\n- [Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/no-code-guide)\n- [Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview)\n\n#### Checkout requirement\n\nEnabling bank transfers on the checkout page requires specifying the\n[customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-customer)\nin the checkout session.\n\nIf you prefer to manually list payment methods, or want to learn more about how\nbank transfers work with invoicing and subscriptions, see the following guides:\n\n- [Accept a bank transfer\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bank-transfers/accept-a-payment)\n- [Send an invoice with bank transfer\ninstructions](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/bank-transfer)\n- [Set up a subscription with bank transfers as a payment\nmethod](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/bank-transfer)\n\n## Customer balance\n\nUnlike most payment methods, bank transfers don’t allow you to control the\namount a customer sends to you, which means that customers might send too much\nor too little money by accident. To manage common overpayment and underpayment\nissues, Stripe holds your customer’s bank transfers in a [customer\nbalance](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/customer-balance) that you can\nreconcile payments from. This allows you to track how much your customers owe,\nregardless of how much or how often they send funds. If funds are held in the\ncustomer balance for more than 75 days, Stripe automatically attempts to return\nthe funds to the customer’s bank account. For further information on what\nhappens when funds remain unreconciled, see the [reconciliation\ndocumentation](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/customer-balance/reconciliation#cash-unreconciled-funds).\n\n## International payments\n\nBank transfers users in the United States can accept international wire\ntransfers (SWIFT). International wire transfers may incur fees on the way to\nStripe, which can result in an amount received that’s less than what the\ncustomer originally sent. Stripe-incurred fees appear on the balances page in\nthe Dashboard, alongside other relevant Stripe fees. The amount shown in the\ncash balance is the amount that Stripe received from the customer.\n\nInternational transfers can take a longer period of time to settle into the\ncustomer balance.\n\nStripe doesn’t support refunds for international wires. You’re responsible for\nexecuting any refunds related to these payments.\n\n#### Note on currencies\n\nThe accounts that support international payments only support their own\ncurrency. For example, US accounts support SWIFT transfers in USD only.\n\n## Cross-border payments\n\nBank transfers users in the United States can accept EUR payments from customers\nin SEPA countries.\n\nWith cross-border bank transfers, you create payments in the currency local to\nthe customer’s country and the customer gets a virtual bank account number local\nto their country. You don’t have to have an account setup for the customer’s\ncountry to use cross-border bank transfers. Cross-border bank transfers incur\nadditional fees that are visible in the Dashboard.\n\nOffering payments to a local bank account with a customer’s local currency helps\nreduce the friction and cost involved in sending money abroad.\n\n### Implement cross-border payments\n\nTo accept cross-border payments, create an additional bank transfers account\nunder the customer with the relevant currency. This generates the relevant\nfunding instructions.\n\n![Add a payment\nmethod](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/payment-methods-add.566463d538eb9f0e714db1f13abcc458.png)\n\nAdd a payment method\n\n![Add a bank transfer\naccount](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/add-bank-transfer-account.0e869fea5fbcb29d17aa1060435eaa7f.png)\n\nAdd a bank transfer account\n\n## Refunds\n\nYou can refund customer balance payments:\n\n- Directly to the customer’s bank account\n- Back to the customer’s cash balance, where the refund can be used towards\nanother customer balance payment\n\nTo refund to the customer’s bank account, Stripe requires the customer’s bank\naccount details. In some cases, Stripe receives these details when the customer\ntransfers funds. When these details aren’t available, Stripe sends an email to\nthe customer to collect bank account details and initiate a transfer when we\nreceive those details.\n\nIf your customer has excess funds in their customer balance, you can initiate a\nreturn of funds through the Dashboard or the API. For more information, see\n[Refund bank transfer\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/customer-balance/refunding).\n\n## Funding instructions\n\nYou can show bank account details to your customer before they make their first\npayment through the Dashboard or the API. See [Funding\ninstructions](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/customer-balance/funding-instructions)\nfor more details.\n\n## Sender information\n\nYou can determine the sender details of an incoming bank transfer through either\nthe Dashboard or the API. Those details can include the name of the sender, the\nreference, and the network through which the transfer arrived.\n\nDashboardAPI- In the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/customers),\nnavigate to the customer’s page.\n- Under **Payment Methods**, expand the cash balance tab.\n- Open the Cash Balance page by clicking **View balance details**.\n\n![Payment methods\nsection](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/payment-methods-section.98d98636d90fbf8ea6e5834dcdde1133.png)\n\nPayment methods section\n\nOn the cash balance page, the **Transactions** section displays a list of the\ncustomer’s incoming and outgoing cash balance transactions.\n\n![List of all customer cash balance\ntransactions](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/transactions-list.f8e2bee93047bd6c85021cfb3db52348.png)\n\nList of all customer cash balance transactions\n\nIncoming transfers have type **Funding**. Find the transfer you’re interested in\nand open its details page by clicking its description.\n\n![Funding details sender\ninformation](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/funding-details-sender-info.b78a278b7f04e003480c0d4308af206b.png)\n\nFunding details sender information\n\n## Disputes\n\nBank transfer payments can’t be reversed except for USD and CAD transactions.\n\n### USD disputes\n\nUSD bank transfers that go through the ACH network in the US can be reversed.\nAfter you push a transfer, you can request that your bank reverse it. You must\nprovide the bank with evidence as to why they should reverse the transfer. The\nremitting bank then sends a reversal to the beneficiary bank. A reversal must be\nsent no later than 5 days after the payment.\n\n### CAD disputes\n\nCAD bank transfers that go through ACH reversals are always initiated by the\nremitting bank, and the beneficiary bank must honor them.\n\n## Connect\n\n[Stripe Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/how-connect-works) can be used\nwith bank transfers to process payments on behalf of connected accounts.\n[Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect) platforms can use bank transfers with\n[any type of charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges#types).\n\nThe [on_behalf_of\nattribute](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-on_behalf_of)\nisn’t supported.\n\n### Accepting bank transfer payments as the connected account\n\n[Direct charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges) require the\nconnected account itself (not the platform) to have activated the bank transfers\npayment method—Connect platforms can use the [relevant bank transfers\ncapability](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities#payment-methods)\nto determine whether this is the case for a connected account. [Standard Connect\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/standard-accounts) can request the\nrelevant capability from their Stripe Dashboard.\n\n### Activation process\n\nThe process varies by country, but in general for bank transfer payments, the\n[required\ninformation](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information)\nis the same as what’s necessary to activate a Stripe account for payments. If\nthe account doesn’t fulfill all the required information, the capability remains\n`inactive` with any issues highlighted on the [capability\nobject](https://docs.stripe.com/api/capabilities/object) in the\n`requirements.currently_due` and `requirements.disabled_reason` fields until\nthese issues have been addressed. After all the highlighted issues are resolved,\nthe capability’s `status` changes to `active`, unless there are issues\nactivating the account in general, in which case Stripe sends the Connect\nplatform owner an email.\n\n## Product support\n\nPayment\nmethod[Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)[Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout)[Payment\nLinks](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)[Payment\nElement](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element)[Express Checkout\nElement](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/express-checkout-element)[Mobile\nPayment\nElement](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/mobile)[Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/subscriptions)[Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing)[Customer\nPortal](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management)Bank transfers1,2\n1 Not supported when using Checkout in subscription mode.2 Not supported when\nusing Checkout in setup mode.\n\n## API support\n\nPayment methodAPI\nenum[PaymentIntents](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents)[SetupIntents](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/setup-intents)[Manual\ncapture](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/place-a-hold-on-a-payment-method)[Setup\nfuture\nusage](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-during-payment?platform=web&ui=elements)1Requires\nredirect2Bank transfers`customer_balance`No\n1 Cards and bank debit methods including SEPA debit, AU BECS direct debit, and\nACSS debit support both `on_session` and `off_session` with [setup future\nusage](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-setup_future_usage).\nAll other payment method types either don’t support `setup_future_usage` or only\nsupport `off_session`.2 Payment methods might require confirmation with\n[return_url](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/confirm#confirm_payment_intent-return_url)\nto indicate where Stripe should redirect your customer after they complete the\npayment.\n\n## Unsupported businesses\n\nStripe can’t accept payments for certain types of businesses.
