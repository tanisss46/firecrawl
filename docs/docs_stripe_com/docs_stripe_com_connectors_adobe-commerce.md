Stripe provides two different connectors for Adobe Commerce and Magento open
source:

- The [payments
connector](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/adobe-commerce/payments) can be
used to accept payments from a wide selection of payment methods and to automate
tax calculation and reporting
- Use the [standalone tax
connector](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/adobe-commerce/standalone-tax) to
automate tax calculation and reporting if you’re not using Stripe to accept
payments. We don’t recommended it if you’re using our payments connector.
