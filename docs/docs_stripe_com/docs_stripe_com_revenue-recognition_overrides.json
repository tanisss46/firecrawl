Use the [data\nimport feature](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/data-import)\ninstead.\n\nIt’s possible for the information on a transaction to become inaccurate for\nrevenue recognition purposes. This can happen for a number of reasons, such as\nhuman error or evolving terms of a sale. The transaction override feature allows\nyou to make corrections, regardless of when you created the transaction.\n\n## Creating a transaction override\n\nYou can find the transaction overrides section at the bottom of the Revenue\nRecognition page.\n\n![Add transaction override\nmodal](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/transaction-override-add-modal.8d198b30d4dc9c1a53fa374d4d647550.png)\n\n[Enter ID of the transaction model to\noverride](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/overrides#model)\nTo get started, enter the `id` of the transaction to override. Stripe supports\noverrides on the following transaction models:\n\nTransaction modelRestrictions[Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)To\noverride line-item-level details, use the [data import\nfeature](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/data-import).[Charges](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges)You\ncan’t override charges that are [associated with an\ninvoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-invoice).\nInstead, override the invoice itself.\nYou can find the `id` of a transaction in the Dashboard or using the API. If the\ntransaction occurred in a previous month, you can also find it in the following\nreport downloads when formatted by\n[invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices):\n\n- Invoice Statement\n- Debits and credits\n- Corrections\n[Choose the override\ntype](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/overrides#override)\nThe following override types are available:\n\nOverride Type DescriptionRecognition period start and end datesThe start date\nand end dates correspond to when the service started and ended. The revenue of\nthis transaction is recognized within this period. Start and end dates can have\nthe same value, in which case revenue is recognized all at once. Read more about\n[how transaction overrides\nwork](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/overrides#how-transaction-overrides-work)\nbelow.Transaction exclusionExcluding a transaction removes all records of it\nfrom revenue recognition. This only works for invoices that are either\n[voided](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/overview#void) or [manually marked as\npaid](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/overview#paid), and have no customer\nbalance applied to them.\n## How transaction overrides work\n\nYou can create transaction overrides for transactions that occurred in both past\naccounting periods and in the current accounting period. If the transaction\noccurred in a past accounting period, corrections are implemented prospectively\nat the end of the current accounting period. You can view these corrections in\nthe reports for the current period after it closes.\n\nIf the overridden transaction occurred in the current accounting period, it’s\nnot reflected as a correction in the current period. Instead, it’s recognized\nusing the new attributes from the override.\n\nCreating a transaction override doesn’t alter the attributes of the transaction\nmodel being overridden.\n\nYou can make changes to a transaction override by deleting the override and\ncreating a new one. If you delete an override that impacts transactions in\nclosed [accounting\nperiods](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/revenue-settings/accounting-period-control),\nthe first open accounting period will reflect the effect of the deletion. If the\ndeleted override impacts transactions in open accounting periods, the effect\napplies directly to those accounting periods.\n\n#### Note\n\nIf you have any feedback on how we can improve transaction overrides to better\nsuit your accounting needs, visit https://support.stripe.com/.\n\n## Links\n\n- [data import feature](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/data-import)\n- [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n- [Charges](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges)\n- [associated with an\ninvoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-invoice)\n- [how transaction overrides\nwork](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/overrides#how-transaction-overrides-work)\n- [voided](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/overview#void)\n- [manually marked as paid](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/overview#paid)\n- [accounting\nperiods](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/revenue-settings/accounting-period-control)",
