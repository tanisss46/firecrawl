This is a message indicating that new information\nis available about the destination account (such as a new account number or\nrouting number).\n\nACH network rules require Stripe to update saved account information when we\nreceive an NOC. We automatically process the NOC by updating the relevant\n`PaymentMethod` or `BankAccount` object and notify you through a webhook. You\nmight want to monitor these webhooks to inform your users that account\ninformation has changed or to update account information that you’ve persisted\noutside of Stripe.\n\nNOC typeFields updatedAccount number`account_number`, `last4`,\n`fingerprint`Routing number`routing_number`, `fingerprint`Account use (for\nexample, checking or savings)`account_type`, `fingerprint`\nNOCs aren’t processed for `OutboundPayment` objects where payment method details\nare provided inline (using `destination_payment_method_data`) as there is no\npersisted `PaymentMethod` or `BankAccount` object in this case to update.\n\n## NOC for a PaymentMethod\n\nWhen we receive an NOC for a transaction originated with a `PaymentMethod`\nobject:\n\n- Stripe updates the `PaymentMethod` and triggers a `payment_method.updated`\nwebhook.\n- If the `PaymentMethod` is attached to a `Customer` (for use with\n`OutboundPayment` objects), Stripe triggers a `customer.source.updated` webhook.\n- If the `PaymentMethod` is attached directly to a Stripe account (for use with\n`InboundTransfer` or `OutboundTransfer` objects), Stripe triggers an\n`account.external_account.updated` webhook.\n\n## NOC for a BankAccount\n\nWhen we receive an NOC for a transaction originated with a `BankAccount` object:\n\n- Stripe updates the `BankAccount` object.\n- If the `BankAccount` is attached to a `Customer` (for use with\n`OutboundPayment` objects), Stripe triggers a `customer.source.updated` webhook.\n- If the `BankAccount` is attached directly to a Stripe account (for use with\n`InboundTransfer` or `OutboundTransfer` objects), Stripe triggers an\n`account.external_account.updated` webhook.\n\nIn cases where the `BankAccount` that’s set up as your platform’s primary\nexternal account is updated, Stripe also notifies you by email. We don’t send an\nemail for updates to external accounts that are attached to your connected\naccounts’ Stripe accounts, or for updates to external accounts attached to\n`Customer` objects.",
