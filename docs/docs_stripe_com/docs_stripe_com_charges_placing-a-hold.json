  "content": "# Placing a hold on a cardCharges API\n\n#### Legacy API\n\nThe content of this section refers to a Legacy feature. Use the [Payment Intents\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment) instead.\n\nThe Charges API doesn’t support the following features, many of which are\nrequired for credit card compliance:\n\n- Merchants in India\n- [Bank requests for card\nauthentication](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/cards/overview)\n- [Strong Customer\nAuthentication](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication)\n\nUse the Charges API to authorize a payment now, capture funds later.\n\nStripe supports two-step card payments so you can first authorize a charge, then\nwait to settle (capture) it later. When a charge is authorized, the card issuer\nguarantees the funds and holds the amount on the customer’s card for, usually,\nup to 7 days, or 2 days for in-person payments using\n[Terminal](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal). The\n[payment_method_details.card.capture_before](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-payment_method_details-card-capture_before)\nattribute on the charge indicates the time when the authorization expires.\n\nIf the charge isn’t captured within this time, the authorization is canceled and\nfunds released.\n\n## Authorize a payment\n\nTo authorize a payment without capturing it, make a charge request that also\nincludes the `capture` parameter with a value of **false**. This instructs\nStripe to only authorize the amount on the customer’s card.\n\n#### Caution\n\n**Only some payment methods support separate authorization and capture.** For\nexample, card payments, Afterpay, and Klarna support separating these steps.\nWith payment methods that don’t support this functionality, like\n[ACH](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ach-direct-debit) or\n[iDEAL](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ideal), you can’t capture manually.\nRefer to the [full list of payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/payment-method-support#additional-api-supportability)\nthat support manual capture.\n\nIf you need to cancel an authorization, you can release it by\n[refunding](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_refund) the relevant `Charge`\nobject.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/charges \\\n -u sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2: \\\n -d \"amount\"=999 \\\n -d \"currency\"=\"usd\" \\\n -d \"description\"=\"Example charge\" \\\n -d \"source\"=\"tok_visa\" \\\n -d \"capture\"=\"false\"\n```\n\n## Capture the funds\n\nTo settle an authorized charge, make a [capture\ncharge](https://docs.stripe.com/api#capture_charge) request. The total\nauthorized amount is captured by default, and you cannot capture more than this.\nTo capture less than the initial amount (for example, 8 USD of a 10 USD\nauthorization), pass the `amount` parameter. Partially capturing a charge\nautomatically releases the remaining amount.\n\n```\ncurl -X POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/charges/{{CHARGE_ID}}/capture \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\"\n```\n\nCard statements from some issuers do not distinguish between authorizations and\ncaptured (settled) charges, which can sometimes lead to confusion for your\ncustomers. In addition, authorized charges can only be captured once. If you\npartially capture a charge, you cannot perform another capture for the\ndifference. Depending on your requirements, you may be better served by [saving\ncustomer’s card details for later](https://docs.stripe.com/saving-cards) and\ncreating charges as needed.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Payment Intents API](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment)\n- [Bank requests for card\nauthentication](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/cards/overview)\n- [Strong Customer\nAuthentication](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication)\n- [Terminal](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal)\n-\n[payment_method_details.card.capture_before](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-payment_method_details-card-capture_before)\n- [ACH](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ach-direct-debit)\n- [iDEAL](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ideal)\n- [full list of payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/payment-method-support#additional-api-supportability)\n- [refunding](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_refund)\n- [capture charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api#capture_charge)\n- [saving customer’s card details for\nlater](https://docs.stripe.com/saving-cards)",
