# Collect tax in Guinea

## Learn how to use Stripe Tax to calculate, collect, and report tax in Guinea.

In Guinea, Stripe only supports collecting VAT for electronically provided
services. In Stripe, these are referred to as “digital products.” To collect
this tax on Stripe, you must be a remote seller without a physical presence in
the country.

## When to register for tax collection

See [Thresholds](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/thresholds) to get insights
about your potential tax registration obligations in Guinea. Stripe also
notifies you with email and Dashboard alerts when you need to register to
collect tax. Learn more about how the [monitoring tool
works](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/monitoring).

Remote sellers providing electronic services (digital products) to individuals
in Guinea have to register for tax from their first sale there. Sales to
business customers in Guinea don’t trigger any tax registration obligations
because non-resident businesses aren’t required to collect tax on these sales.

- **Threshold**: 1 transaction
- **Included transactions**: Business-to-consumer (B2C) sales of digital goods
or electronically supplied services (digital products)

## How we calculate taxes

We only support calculations for [digital
products](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes?type=digital) (non-physical
items or services that are delivered, given, or rendered electronically) in
Guinea. Stripe doesn’t calculate tax for products that don’t use a digital
product tax code.

View the list of supported [digital product tax
codes](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes?type=digital). To calculate taxes
in Guinea, make sure that you [assign a tax
code](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/products-prices-tax-codes-tax-behavior#tax-code-on-product)
to each of your products.

## Report and file your taxes

Stripe provides reports of your completed tax transactions. Go to

reports. Learn more about [the different types of
reports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports).

You’re responsible for filing and remitting your taxes to Guinea. Stripe doesn’t
file taxes on your behalf.
