We\nrecommend that you configure your payment methods from the Stripe Dashboard\nusing the instructions in [Accept a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web&ui=stripe-hosted).\n\nIf you want to continue manually configuring the payment methods you present to\nyour customers with Checkout, use this guide. Otherwise, update your integration\nto [configure payment methods in the\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/dashboard-payment-methods).\n\nIntegrating with Naira bank transfer enables Nigerian customers to pay using a\nlocal bank transfer.\n\nStripe’s merchant of record service provider offers a redirect-based payment\nflow for local bank transfers (also known locally as “Transfers”). When a\ncustomer makes a payment, Stripe redirects them to the local merchant of record\nservice provider’s checkout flow to authenticate and authorize the payment.\nAfter the customer authorizes the payment, Stripe redirects them back to your\nsite.\n\n[Determine\ncompatibility](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ng-bank-transfer/accept-a-payment#compatibility)\n[A Checkout\nSession](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/how-checkout-works#session)\nmust satisfy all of the following conditions to support Nigerian payment\nmethods:\n\n- Express [prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices) for all line items in\nNigerian naira (currency code `ngn`).\n- The transaction amount must be between 500 NGN and 100,000,000 NGN.\n[Accept a Naira bank transfer\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ng-bank-transfer/accept-a-payment#accept-a-ng-bank-transfer-payment)\nTo enable Naira bank transfer, update your integration to:\n\n- Add `ng_bank_transfer` to the list of `payment_method_types` when you create a\n[Checkout Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions).\n- Make sure all `line_items` use the `ngn` currency.\n\n```\nStripe::Checkout::Session.create({\n mode: 'payment',\n payment_method_types: ['card'],\n payment_method_types: ['card', 'ng_bank_transfer'],\n line_items: [{\n price_data: {\n currency: 'usd',\n # To accept `ng_bank_transfer`, all line items must have currency: ngn\n currency: 'ngn',\n product_data: {\n name: 'T-shirt',\n },\n unit_amount: 2000,\n },\n quantity: 1,\n }],\n success_url: 'https://example.com/success',\n cancel_url: 'https://example.com/cancel',\n})\n```\n\n[Test your\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ng-bank-transfer/accept-a-payment#test-integration)\nWhen testing your Checkout integration, select **Nigerian payment methods** as\nthe payment method and click **Pay**.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Accept a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web&ui=stripe-hosted)\n- [configure payment methods in the\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/dashboard-payment-methods)\n- [A Checkout\nSession](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/how-checkout-works#session)\n- [prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices)\n- [Checkout Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions)\n- [https://example.com/success](https://example.com/success)\n- [https://example.com/cancel](https://example.com/cancel)",
