It uses hundreds of\nsignals about each payment, and taps into data across our network of millions of\nbusinesses, to predict whether a payment is likely to be fraudulent.\n\nOur [machine learning system](https://stripe.com/radar/guide) is flexible and\nresponsive, continuously learns from new customer purchase patterns and\ntransaction features, and incorporates feedback from you whenever payments are\nindicated as fraudulent.\n\n#### Note\n\nWhen a business using Stripe sees a card for the first time, there’s a 91%\nchance that we’ve seen the card elsewhere on the Stripe network in the past.\n\n## When to use Radar\n\nRadar evaluates risk and runs rules for three different types of Stripe API\nobjects: [Charges](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges),\n[PaymentIntents](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents) and\n[SetupIntents](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents). Stripe designed the\nRadar rules to take four different actions:\n\n- Request 3DS authentication\n- Allow the creation of the object\n- Block the creation of the object\n- Review the creation of a Charge\n\nThe following table illustrates which rules Radar runs for each type of API\nobject:\n\nTransaction typeRequest 3DS Allow & Block Review Charge✔ ✔ PaymentIntent✔ ✔ ✔\nSetupIntent✔ ✔\nYou can enable Radar for SetupIntents in your [Radar\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/radar/settings).\n\n## Risk outcomes\n\nThe Stripe machine learning models evaluate the likelihood that a payment is\nfraudulent. This judgment can take one of five values:\n\n- [High risk](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/risk-evaluation#high-risk)\n- [Elevated risk](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/risk-evaluation#elevated-risk)\n- [Normal risk](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/risk-evaluation#normal-risk)\n- [Not evaluated](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/risk-evaluation#not-evaluated)\n- [Unknown risk](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/risk-evaluation#unknown-risk)\n\nEach payment includes information on the *outcome* of our risk evaluation.\n\nRadar for fraud teams users will see a [risk\ninsights](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews/risk-insights) section on the\npayment page that provides more details about why we assigned a payment a\nparticular risk level and score.\n\nIf a card issuer [declines](https://docs.stripe.com/declines) a payment, Stripe\nalso includes any information we receive from them as part of the outcome.\n\nThe outcome for each payment is available when viewing a payment in the\n[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/) or through the API as part of the\n[Outcome](https://docs.stripe.com/api#charge_object-outcome) attribute of the\n[Charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api#charge_object) object.\n\n### High risk payments\n\nStripe reports payments as high risk when we believe they’re likely to be\nfraudulent. Payments of this risk level are\n[blocked](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules#built-in-rules) by default.\n\nOn the `Charge` object of a high risk payment, the `risk_level` is set to\n`highest`.\n\n```\n...\n\"outcome\":\n{\n \"network_status\": \"not_sent_to_network\",\n \"reason\": \"highest_risk_level\",\n \"risk_level\": \"highest\",\n \"risk_score\": 92, // Provided only with Stripe Radar for Fraud Teams\n \"seller_message\": \"Stripe blocked this charge as too risky.\",\n \"type\": \"blocked\",\n}\n...\n```\n\nIf Stripe Radar ever blocks a payment that you know is legitimate, you can\nremove the block using the Dashboard. To do this, view the payment in the\nDashboard and click **Add to allow list**. Adding a payment to the allow list\ndoesn’t retry the payment, but it does prevent Stripe Radar from blocking future\npayment attempts with that card or email address.\n\n#### Note\n\nDon’t see **Add to allow list**? [Contact\nStripe](https://support.stripe.com/email) to have this feature added to your\nRadar account.\n\n### Elevated risk payments\n\nElevated risk payments have an increased chance of being fraudulent. Stripe\nRadar allows payments of this risk level by default. Stripe Radar for Fraud\nTeams automatically places elevated risk payments into your\n[review](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews) queue so you can take a closer\nlook.\n\nOn the `Charge` object of an elevated risk payment, the `risk_level` is set to\n`elevated`.\n\n```\n...\n\"outcome\": {\n \"network_status\": \"approved_by_network\",\n \"reason\": \"elevated_risk_level\",\n \"risk_level\": \"elevated\",\n \"risk_score\": 56, // Provided only with Stripe Radar for Fraud Teams\n\"seller_message\": \"Stripe evaluated this charge as having elevated risk, and\nplaced it in your manual review queue.\",\n \"type\": \"manual_review\"\n}\n...\n```\n\n### Normal risk payments\n\nPayments with a normal risk evaluation have fewer characteristics that are\nstrongly indicative of fraud than payments with elevated or high risk levels.\nHowever, we recommend that you continue to be vigilant when fulfilling these\norders. Payments that have normal risk can still turn out to be fraudulent and\nthere are other possible [types of\nfraud](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/identifying-fraud) that can\noccur later on in the order process.\n\nOn the `Charge` object of a successful payment with normal risk, the\n`risk_level` is set to `normal`.\n\n```\n...\n\"outcome\":\n{\n \"network_status\": \"approved_by_network\",\n \"reason\": null,\n \"seller_message\": \"The charge was authorized.\",\n \"risk_level\": \"normal\",\n \"risk_score\": 23, // Provided only with Stripe Radar for Fraud Teams\n \"type\": \"authorized\",\n}\n...\n```\n\n### Not evaluated\n\nThe Risk level is set to `not_assessed` for non-card payments, card-based\npayments predating the public assignment of risk levels, and for payments where\nthe merchant opts out of Radar fraud risk assessment.\n\nOn the `Charge` object of an unevaluated payment, the `risk_level` is set to\n`not_assessed`.\n\n```\n...\n\"outcome\": {\n \"network_status\": \"approved_by_network\",\n \"reason\": \"not_assessed_risk_level\",\n \"risk_level\": \"not_assessed\",\n\"seller_message\": \"Your business has opted out of Radar fraud risk\nassessments.\",\n \"type\": \"authorized\"\n}\n...\n```\n\n### Unknown risk payments\n\nIn unusual cases, an error might cause risk evaluation to fail. In this case,\nStripe reports the payment as having unknown risk.\n\nOn the `Charge` object of an unknown risk payment, the `risk_level` is set to\n`unknown`.\n\n```\n...\n\"outcome\": {\n \"network_status\": \"approved_by_network\",\n \"reason\": \"unknown_risk_level\",\n \"risk_level\": \"unknown\",\n\"seller_message\": \"Something went wrong while evaluating this payment. Our\nengineers have been notified and we’ll look into this as soon as possible.\",\n \"type\": \"authorized\"\n}\n...\n```\n\n## Searching for a specific risk level in the Dashboard\n\nYou can search for payments of a specific risk level using the **risk_level**\nsearch term and the desired risk level. For example, a search for\n[risk_level:highest](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/search?query=risk_level%3Ahighest)\nreturns a list of all payments with a high risk level. Likewise, a search for\n[risk_level:elevated](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/search?query=risk_level%3Aelevated)\nreturns a list of all payments with an elevated risk level.\n\n## Feedback on risk evaluations\n\nWhile we use information across our network to evaluate a payment, you might\nhave additional information about a payment as a result of a customer\ninteraction. The Stripe machine learning models respond to feedback you share\nwith us, and you can help improve our fraud detection algorithms by\n[refunding](https://docs.stripe.com/refunds) and reporting payments that you\nbelieve are fraudulent.\n\nRefunding fraudulent payments helps improve our fraud detection algorithms and\nthe accuracy of our risk evaluations for this payment, and similar ones in the\nfuture.\n\nTo refund a payment and mark it as fraudulent, view the payment in the Dashboard\nand then:\n\n- Click **Refund**.\n- Select **Fraudulent** as the **Reason**.\n- Provide a brief explanation.\n\nYou can also indicate that a payment is fraudulent when you [create a\nrefund](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_refund) using the API by providing\n`fraudulent` as the value for `reason`. This adds the email address and card\nfingerprint associated with the payment to the default email address and card\nfingerprint [block lists](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/lists#default-lists).\n\n```\n# Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production.\n# See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys\nStripe.api_key = 'sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2'\n\n# If you haven't refunded the charge, you can do so and let Stripe\n# know it was fraudulent in one step.\nStripe::Refund.create({\n charge: '{{CHARGE_ID}}',\n reason: 'fraudulent',\n})\n\n# If you already refunded the charge (without specifying the\n# 'fraudulent' reason), you can still let us know it was fraudulent.\nStripe::Charge.update(\n '{{CHARGE_ID}}',\n {\n fraud_details: {\n user_report: 'fraudulent',\n },\n }\n)\n```\n\nFor a small subset of charges, Stripe modifies the reported risk score so we can\nmeasure the performance of our models and obtain data for subsequent model\ndevelopment. This allows Stripe to ensure key metrics like false positive rate\nand recall remain within desirable ranges, and that model performance continues\nto improve.\n\nIf you don’t want the protection of the Stripe Radar machine learning models,\nyou can opt out by [contacting](https://stripe.com/contact) our Support team.\n\n## Links\n\n- [ultimately\nresponsible](https://stripe.com/us/legal#processing-transactions-disputes)\n- [machine learning system](https://stripe.com/radar/guide)\n- [subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating)\n- [Charges](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges)\n- [PaymentIntents](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents)\n- [SetupIntents](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents)\n- [Radar settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/radar/settings)\n- [Risk Settings](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/risk-settings)\n- [risk insights](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews/risk-insights)\n- [declines](https://docs.stripe.com/declines)\n- [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/)\n- [Outcome](https://docs.stripe.com/api#charge_object-outcome)\n- [Charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api#charge_object)\n- [blocked](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules#built-in-rules)\n- [Contact Stripe](https://support.stripe.com/email)\n- [review](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews)\n- [types of\nfraud](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/identifying-fraud)\n-\n[risk_level:highest](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/search?query=risk_level%3Ahighest)\n-\n[risk_level:elevated](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/search?query=risk_level%3Aelevated)\n- [refunding](https://docs.stripe.com/refunds)\n- [create a refund](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_refund)\n- [block lists](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/lists#default-lists)\n- [https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys)\n- [contacting](https://stripe.com/contact)",
