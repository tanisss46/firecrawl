This is useful for you and your support teams to understand\nthe overall user journey of your connected accounts. If you have any questions,\n[contact Stripe Support](https://support.stripe.com/).\n\n#### Note\n\nTax reporting features are not currently visible in the embedded components. You\ncan access them later during Tax Season 2024, ahead of relevant milestones as\nnoted below. This page gives a preview of the user experience.\n\n## Connect embedded components\n\nYou can give your connected accounts access to components for managing tax\ninformation and receiving 1099s electronically, all embedded within your\nplatform. To do this,\n[integrate](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/deliver-tax-forms#file-deliver-embedded)\nand [configure](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/embedded-comms) Connect embedded\ncomponents and enable e-delivery.\n\nStripe can send pre-filing confirmation emails to collect tax information and\npaperless delivery consent directly from your connected accounts. We’ll email\nyour eligible connected accounts starting the week of November 4. You can select\nthis option when you configure your [tax form\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/tax_forms).\n\n## 1099 tax reporting lifecycle\n\nThe following sections describe what the process looks like after Connect\nembedded components are set up and e-delivery is enabled.\n\n### Your connected account receives a pre-filing confirmation email from Stripe\n\nYour connected account receives an email from Stripe asking them to confirm\ntheir tax information and update their delivery preferences. The subject line\nreads ‘Get your [Platform_Name] 2024 tax forms faster by enabling e-delivery.’\n\n![Stripe Express Tax form email from\nStripe.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/tax-reporting-prever-email-2024.3a2bddb9602387c7cf916aa9b9829a45.png)\n\nPre-filing confirmation email from Stripe\n\n### Your connected account is directed to your platform\n\nDuring pre-filing confirmation, your connected account is directed to the\n[Account Management embedded\ncomponent](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/supported-embedded-components/account-management),\nwhere they can confirm their account information and agree to paperless delivery\nof their 1099 tax form. They can also edit information other than tax\ninformation in the Account Management component.\n\n![The Account Management embedded\ncomponent](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/embedded-paperless-consent.a38f74c68db322c2143e76aa055349c0.png)\n\nThe Account Management embedded component\n\nYour accounts could get blocked if you’ve applied 1099 capabilities and the\nconnected account updates their value to a name and TIN combination that doesn’t\nmatch against IRS records. Similarly, if Stripe is unable to complete KYC\nrequirements on them based on the information they provided, their account\npayouts are blocked until they correct their information.\n\n### Connected account owners agree to paperless delivery\n\nWhen your connected account edits their tax form delivery method, they can agree\nto paperless delivery.\n\n![The dialog to select the option of paperless delivery of tax\nforms](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/embedded-select-edelivery-option.0d6a7bf8fcae3ca9c2615512a64a47bf.png)\n\nThe dialog to consent to paperless delivery of tax forms.\n\n![The dialog to consent to paperless delivery of tax\nforms](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/embedded-edelivery-consent.646bb83a2fa6c412b5dc0bffca36e845.png)\n\nCurrently, connected accounts can’t request a paper copy in addition to the\ne-delivery of the tax form.\n\n### Your connected account receives the e-delivery email from Stripe\n\nAfter you file 1099 tax forms in your platform’s Stripe Dashboard, your\nconnected account receives an email from Stripe to view their tax form\nelectronically.
