# Best practices for preventing fraud

## Learn how to use best practices to protect against disputes and fraudulent payments.

Creating an effective dispute and fraud prevention strategy that best suits your
business can help prevent fraud from occurring. By employing some of these best
practices as part of your overall strategy, you can avoid excessive chargebacks
and reduce potential customer burden and losses.

## Tools for everyone

These are tools that any Stripe user—whether or not they’re a developer, and
whether or not they use any specialized Stripe tools like
[Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar)—can leverage to reduce fraud and dispute
incidents.

### Be clear and transparent with your customers

Clear and frequent contact with your customers can help prevent many of the
[reasons](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/categories) for disputes. By
responding to issues and processing refunds or replacement orders quickly, your
customers are far less likely to take the time to dispute a payment. Make your
customer service contact information easy to find, keep customers updated
throughout their order process, and provide updates about deliveries.

#### Caution

Include a clear description of your refund and cancellation policies in your
terms of service. You can require your users to agree to your terms of service
to increase the likelihood that card issuers respect your policies in the event
of a dispute.

- Require ToS Agreement
In general, make your terms of service and policies easy to find on your
website, and require customers to agree to them. Rather than only linking to
them during checkout, provide a full version of them on the checkout page or as
a pop-up with a requirement to agree to them prior to submitting the order.
- Show complete policy
Card issuers can be very specific about how you present your policies. If you
have a checkbox your customer must accept that only contains a link, the issuer
might reject it as unsatisfactory evidence that your customer was aware of your
policies. There must be reasonable evidence that you presented your customer
with a full copy of your policies prior to their purchase.
- Track shipping
When shipping physical goods to customers, use carriers and services that
provide online tracking and delivery confirmation whenever possible. Provide
this information to your customers as soon as it’s available (if you need to
submit tracking information as dispute evidence, be aware that card issuers
don’t follow links so screenshots must be provided).
- Use clear statement descriptors
Set a recognizable name for your [statement
descriptor](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/activate#public-business-information)
through your [account
settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/account/?support_details=true).
We recommend using your website domain or business name to make sure customers
can easily identify their purchase when they look at their statement.

Statement descriptors are limited to between 5 and 22 characters. They must
contain at least 5 letters and can’t use the special characters `<`, `>`, `\`,
`'`, or `"`.
- Separate your business accounts
Avoid using the same Stripe account for separate businesses. Each Stripe account
should represent a single business, which allows for separate statement
descriptors and contact information. If you need to process payments for
multiple businesses, create [additional
accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/multiple-accounts) for
each.

### Consider proactively refunding suspicious payments

You should immediately refund any payment you’re [sure is
fraud](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/identifying-fraud) (unless
you’re covered by some form of liability shift, such as with [3D
Secure](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure/authentication-flow#disputed-payments)).
If you know you’re going to receive a fraud dispute on it, you can save yourself
the [dispute
fee](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/how-disputes-work#dispute-fees), the
increase to your [dispute
rate](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/measuring#dispute-rate-usage), and the
potential loss of product by fully refunding the fraudulent payment.

#### Caution

While customers can’t dispute fully refunded payments, they can still dispute
partially refunded payments. Card network rules even allow for a payment that
has been partially refunded to be disputed for the full payment amount.

However, sometimes you might suspect a payment is fraud, but your suspicions
fall short of absolute certainty. Sometimes it makes sense to aggressively
refund every charge that falls into this gray area and sometimes it doesn’t.

You might want to pursue an aggressive refund strategy if any of the following
apply:

- **Order not yet fulfilled**. The loss of your product could be prevented by a
refund. That is, if you haven’t already committed your product or service in
some irreversible way by the time you suspect fraud, you might want to be more
aggressive in refunding. Whereas if your product or service was
irretrievable—for example, the product already shipped, or the service has
already been used—it might make more sense *not* to refund, and to wait and see
if it does turn out to be fraud.
- **Excessive disputes**. Your recent dispute activity has been
[excessive](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/measuring#excessive-dispute-activity)
by card network definitions, which could put your account standing with Stripe
at risk or put you at risk of being identified into a chargeback monitoring
program.
- **Chargeback monitoring program**. You’re already in a [chargeback monitoring
program](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/monitoring-programs) and need to exit
the program.
- **New or small business**. Your business has small enough payment volume (say,
fewer than 100 payments per month) that one or two fraud disputes can have a
very outsized impact on your [dispute
rate](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/measuring#dispute-rate-usage), even if
you otherwise have little dispute activity.

If none of the above apply, you might want to be more conservative with how
frequently you proactively refund charges you suspect are fraudulent.

#### Refunding a payment as fraud

To refund a payment, in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/), select
the payment and click **Refund as fraud**. This refunds the payment and reports
it as fraudulent to Stripe so that we can further improve our fraud detection.

### Delay shipping orders

If you ship physical goods, consider delaying the shipment by 24-48 hours. This
time gives cardholders a chance to spot and report any fraud on their accounts.
You would still receive a fraud dispute in this scenario, but at least you
wouldn’t also lose the merchandise. Not all cardholders check their statements
on a daily basis, however, and their card issuer might not proactively notify
them about the transaction.

[Customers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers) that request overnight or
expedited shipping should be considered higher risk, as the increased cost of
such services is of no consequence to fraudsters. One tactic you can use to
identify these types of payments is to offer same day or overnight shipping at a
very high cost–many times more expensive than any other shipping option you
provide.

It’s far less likely that any legitimate customer would pay such a high cost,
but a fraudster would want the goods to be shipped as soon as possible and have
no regard for the additional cost. You can then manually screen any customers
that opt for the anomalously expensive shipping option and scrutinize the order
to determine if it looks genuine. Using a [separate auth and capture
process](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/best-practices#use-auth-and-capture-when-creating-payments)
together with [Radar
reviews](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/best-practices#manually-review-payments)
is a good way to do so.

### Ship to a verified address

Shipping to a [verified billing
address](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/verification#avs-check)
which has passed postal code and street address checks is the safest option.
When using an address that hasn’t been verified, you can’t prove that the order
was shipped to the legitimate cardholder if the payment is later disputed.

This doesn’t prevent you shipping to a different address, though you should do
all you can to mitigate the risks involved. For instance, you may only want to
ship orders to a different address for returning customers you already know to
be legitimate, or who provide a fully verifiable billing address. In addition,
any of the following could indicate the payment is suspicious:

- The order is much larger than normal, or is only for your most expensive
products
- The customer changed the shipping address after placing the order
- The customer requested expedited shipping
- The products ordered have a high resale value
- The shipping destination is different from the billing address or the card’s
country of origin (for example, the billing address is in Spain, but the
shipping address is in France)

Reviewing the order and the shipping address information can help you determine
whether or not the order presents an unacceptable risk to you.

### Benchmarking your dispute rate

Your account’s [dispute
rate](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/measuring#dispute-rate-usage) is an
important metric to use when reviewing the efficacy of your disputes and fraud
prevention methods. You can regularly review these metrics in your Stripe
Dashboard to see the impact your dispute prevention strategies are having.

## Tools for users of Radar for Fraud Teams

[Radar](https://stripe.com/radar) is a suite of features and tools for fighting
fraud that is built into Stripe and requires no additional integration work.

### Manually review payments

[Radar for Fraud Teams](https://stripe.com/radar/fraud-teams) includes a
[review](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews) feature that allows you to place
certain payments into review—though keep in mind that these payments are still
processed and the credit card charged, unless you are using a separate auth and
capture process. These payments are placed into the [review
queue](https://dashboard.stripe.com/radar) for you to take a closer look at. If
you suspect the payment is fraudulent, you can refund it.

You should review payments that Stripe has placed into your [review
queue](https://dashboard.stripe.com/radar) as soon as possible. Payments with an
[elevated risk](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/risk-evaluation#elevated-risk) of
fraud are automatically marked for review. You can also create additional rules
to customize the types of payments that should be placed in your review queue.

Here are some considerations when reviewing a payment:

- Does the billing address match the shipping address?
- Has the billing address been verified by AVS? Does it also match the card’s
country of origin?
- Does the customer’s email address match the cardholder’s name?
- Is this an order that the customer has asked to be expedited?
- Have multiple orders from different credit cards originated from this same IP
address?
- Has this customer made many order attempts that have been declined?

If you’re unsure about a payment when you’re reviewing it, you should always
contact the customer by phone or email. If a payment’s billing and shipping
address don’t match, look into the shipping address using [Google Maps & Street
View](https://www.google.com/maps/streetview) to find out more. A common tactic
that fraudsters use is to have orders shipped to a freight or mail forwarding
service or storage facility that forwards the goods to their actual location.

### Use Radar rules to automatically block payments or place them in review

[Radar for Fraud Teams](https://stripe.com/radar/fraud-teams), is built directly
into the payment flow and combines a customizable rules engine with powerful
machine learning algorithms. It can detect patterns across payments from every
business processing payments with Stripe, assessing the risk of each one.

Using [rules](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules), you can automatically
evaluate payments based on your specific detection criteria and take the
appropriate action on them. You can also create rules that use multiple
criteria, allowing you to allow or block payments that meet multiple conditions.
Each business has different risks.

### Country and card type limiting

If you’re experiencing increased fraud coming from certain countries, you can
set up rules to block payments from any country you do not want to accept
payments from, using the `:ip_country:` and `:card_country:` rule attributes.
For example, you can create the following rule to block all payments and cards
originating from Canada: `Block if :ip_country: = ca and :card_country: = 'ca'`.
Similarly, if your business only supports the country it operates in, you can
create a rule that blocks any payments from all other countries. For example, a
rule to block payments that don’t originate from Australia is: `Block if
:ip_country: != au and :card_country: != 'au'`.

You can set limits on which type of cards to accept, either by brand, (for
example, Mastercard), or by funding type (for example, pre-paid). This can be
particularly helpful if you see excessive fraud from certain card types. To
block payments from all Visa-issued debit cards, an example rule would be:
`Block if :card_brand: = visa and :card_funding: = 'debit'`.

## Tools for developers

These are tools that require some development work to implement. If you rely on
a [Stripe partner](https://stripe.com/partners) to provide your payments
integration, you might not have the ability to directly implement these on your
own.

### Process your transactions on Stripe

The [Visa Compelling Evidence
3.0](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/categories#visa-ce-30) rules rely on
transaction history to dispute friendly fraud by showing previous non-fraud
transactions with the same cardholder within a specified period. When you get a
Visa fraud dispute, Stripe can identify qualifying transactions in your history
on our platform and pre-populate the dispute response with most of the required
evidence you need. You can use this evidence to significantly increase your
likelihood of overturning the dispute in your favor.

Stripe can’t determine eligibility or submit evidence for externally processed
transactions, so we recommend:

- Using Stripe processing whenever possible
- Including the customer IP address, email address, shipping address, and
product descriptions in your transactions with Stripe

### Collect as much payment information as possible

Some disputes are lost because only the minimum information was required during
checkout. This makes it difficult (sometimes impossible) for Stripe or the card
issuer to verify that the customer is legitimate. For instance, while a billing
postal code isn’t always necessary to process a card payment, including it
allows the payment to be verified by the card issuer. If verification fails,
consider rejecting the payment because this might indicate fraud.

Use [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout) or [Advanced fraud
detection](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/advanced-fraud-detection)
to make sure your integration is best equipped to provide relevant payment
information, such as:

- [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers) name
- Customer email address
- CVC number
- Full billing address and postal code
- Shipping address (if different from billing address)
- Tracking information

### Implement a cardholder authentication method such as 3D Secure

[3D Secure](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure) is a way to add a
verification step between the customer and the card issuer to your checkout
flow. Payments that have been authenticated with 3D Secure might be protected
from most fraudulent disputes through a rule known as [liability
shift](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure/authentication-flow#disputed-payments).
You will, however, still receive [Early Fraud
Warnings](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/how-disputes-work#early-fraud-warnings)
that can count against [card brand monitoring
programs](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/monitoring-programs).

Learn more at [Card Authentication and 3D
Secure](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure).

### Programmatically verify your customer’s identity

For some, verifying the identity of customers can be beneficial. Consider using
[Stripe Identity](https://docs.stripe.com/identity) to verify a government ID
and match with a selfie of the document holder. Alternatively, you can ask
customers to connect their
[Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/overview/) or
[LinkedIn](https://developer.linkedin.com/docs/oauth2) accounts as a further
proof of identity. This is an extra step that a fraudulent actor might not take.
Some legitimate customers might not want to go through this additional step
either, and your conversion rate might suffer as a result.

### Use auth and capture when creating payments

Credit card charge attempts are processed in two parts. The charge is first
*authorized* by requesting authorization for the amount to charge from the card
issuer. After a charge is approved, by default it’s then *captured* immediately
afterwards and the amount deducted from the card.

A [capture
later](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/place-a-hold-on-a-payment-method)
payment flow (sometimes called “auth and capture”) is the process of performing
these two steps at separate times. The authorization can be made first, which
holds the amount on the card and appears on a customer’s statement as a pending
transaction, but does not actually move money out of their account. The charge
can then be captured any time up to 7 days after the authorization. Capturing a
charge completes the payment and the funds are deducted from the customer’s
card. If a charge isn’t captured within the time limit, the authorization is
automatically released.

Similar to delayed shipping, this method can allow enough time for potential
fraud to come to light, giving you the option to carefully review—and
potentially refund—the transaction. Cardholders cannot dispute uncaptured
authorizations, only fully captured payments. With Radar for Fraud Teams you can
manually capture these payments in the [review
process](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/best-practices#manually-review-payments).

### Set a custom statement descriptor for each payment

The statement descriptor is the text that appears on customers’ card statements
with information about the company that’s associated with a payment. One way to
use a statement descriptor is to insert a short, random code that your customer
then has to verify. When you suspect a transaction might be fraudulent, you can
contact your customer and ask them to give you the code that is shown on their
online statement, and if they do not, you would refund the payment.

You can either edit your [default statement
descriptor](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public) within the Dashboard
or set a [dynamic statement
descriptor](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/statement-descriptors#dynamic)
whenever a payment is created through the API.

While this method can’t help against a fraudster who may have access to a
cardholder’s online card issuer or credit account, this is rare. Using the
statement descriptor in this manner can provide reassurance that the customer is
likely to be genuine. As with some other prevention methods, the added customer
friction of this method could lead to some legitimate payments being refunded.
