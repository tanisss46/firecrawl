  "content": "# Older payment APIs\n\n## Information about our older APIs and the newer APIs that replace them.\n\nWe’ve replaced some of our older APIs and no longer update their documentation.\n\n## Migrate to current APIs\n\nThe older APIs are limited. To get the latest Stripe features, migrate to the\n[Payment Intents](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents), [Setup\nIntents](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/setup-intents), and [Payment\nMethods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods) APIs. See each\nindividual API’s docs for specifics on migrating.\n\n## Deprecation of the Sources API\n\nWe’ve deprecated support for local payment methods in the [Sources\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/sources) and plan to turn it off. If you currently\nhandle any local payment methods using the Sources API, you must [migrate them\nto the current\nAPIs](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/transitioning). We’ll\ncommunicate more information about this end of support via email.\n\nWe’ve also deprecated support for card payments in the Sources API, but don’t\ncurrently plan to turn it off.\n\n## Older APIs that remain available\n\nAlthough unsupported, these APIs aren’t going away. Until you upgrade your\nintegration, you can still use these APIs:\n\n- [Charges](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/charges-api)\n- [ACH](https://docs.stripe.com/ach-deprecated)\n\n## Comparing the APIs\n\nFeature Payment Intents, Setup Intents, & Payment MethodsCharges, Tokens, &\nSourcesSupported payment methods[Cards, digital wallets, bank transfers, and so\non](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/overview)Cards,\nACH[SCA-ready](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication)Works with\n[Terminal](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal) (in-person payments)Future\ndevelopment\n\n## Links\n\n- [Payment Intents](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents)\n- [Setup Intents](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/setup-intents)\n- [Payment Methods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods)\n- [Sources API](https://docs.stripe.com/sources)\n- [migrate them to the current\nAPIs](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/transitioning)\n- [Charges](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/charges-api)\n- [ACH](https://docs.stripe.com/ach-deprecated)\n- [Cards, digital wallets, bank transfers, and so\non](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/overview)\n- [SCA-ready](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication)\n- [Terminal](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal)",
