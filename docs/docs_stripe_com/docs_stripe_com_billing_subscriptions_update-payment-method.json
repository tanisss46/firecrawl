The links don’t update other subscriptions or the\ncustomer’s default payment method.\n\n## Restrictions\n\n- The subscription’s status must be `active`, `past_due`, or `trialing`. It\ncannot be `unpaid`.\n- The subscription’s billing must be `auto` and charge a payment method. It\ncannot be `send`.\n- This feature only supports updating card payment methods.\n- Each link only allows a customer to update their payment details one time.\n- If unused, a link expires after 30 days.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Dashboard > Customers](https://dashboard.stripe.com/customers)\n- [Dashboard > Billing >\nSubscriptions](https://dashboard.stripe.com/subscriptions)",
