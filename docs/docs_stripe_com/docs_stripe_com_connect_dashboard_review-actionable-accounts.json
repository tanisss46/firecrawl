View any risk or\nonboarding restrictions that impact your accounts or that will impact them in\nthe future.\n- **Identify the exact requirements needed**: Understand an account status\nquickly, without needing to look through webhook logs. View clear instructions\non how to resolve open requirements and take action.\n- **Export a list of accounts**: Download a CSV list of accounts, including\nremediation links that your accounts with open requirements can use to submit\ninformation and resolve issues.\n\n## View all accounts\n\nThe [Accounts to review\npage](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/accounts_to_review) in your Dashboard\nprovides a list of all your connected accounts with open risk, verification, and\nonboarding requirements.\n\n![The Accounts to review page showing connected accounts that need\naction.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/accounts-to-review-listview.ae6f4ea186508bdeefa80870c7972208.png)\n\nTo view the accounts in a particular status, select the corresponding tab:\n\nTabDescriptionActions requiredActive accounts with open risk, onboarding, or\nverification requirements from Stripe or from your platform.In reviewActive\naccounts that Stripe is reviewing submitted information for or is conducting an\naccount review of, regardless of whether any account capabilities are\nrestricted.RejectedAll accounts that have been rejected by Stripe or by your\nplatform.\nIn the **Actions required** and **In review** tabs, you can toggle the\n**Restrictions** column between restrictions and information needed by clicking\nthe gear in its heading.\n\n#### Note\n\nStripe puts some verifications on hold for accounts that haven’t had activity in\nthe last 540 days.

In\nthe **Rejected** tab, you can also sort by accounts with any ongoing appeals.\n\n#### Note\n\nThe **Total volume** column displays “Unavailable” for connected accounts with\nStripe Dashboard access where you don’t have [platform\ncontrols](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/platform-controls-for-stripe-dashboard-accounts)\nenabled. Filtering by volume always excludes them. You can identify these\naccounts by filtering the list by platform controls.\n\nDepending on a connected account’s configuration, you can take action on it in\nthe **Action required** list or **In review** list by clicking the account’s\noverflow menu . You can take the following actions:\n\n- View **Actions required** list on the Account details page.\n- Reject the account.\n- Pause or resume payouts for the account.\n- Pause or resume payments for the account.\n- Generate a [remediation\nlink](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard/remediation-links) that the\naccount can use to take required actions.\n\n![A dropdown menu showing the ability to reject the connected account, pause\npayouts, pause payments, view required actions, or generate a remediation\nlink](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/available-actions.1434b91974aa8acd2b5d3531fd747d8d.png)\n\n## Filter for accounts requiring additional information on business model review\n\nTo enable Stripe’s services, your business must comply with Stripe’s [Terms of\nService regarding supported business types, products, and\nindustries](https://stripe.com/legal/restricted-businesses).

If\nso, that requirement appears in the **Actions required** section of the\nconnected account detail page.\n\n![A connected account's Actions required list showing a TOS\nrequest](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/cactus-actions-required.0d2aa5213b0c3f26ed7fc257e82c1643.png)\n\nTo filter for accounts requiring additional information for business model\nreview:\n\n- Navigate to **Accounts to review**.\n- Select **More filters**, then **Information needed**.\n- In the **Filter by information needed** search box, type **verification**.\n- Select the following items, then click **Apply**.- Additional info request\n(Verification)\n- Rejection appeal (Verification)\n- URL (verification)\n\n![A filter to return accounts requiring information for business model\nreview](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/verification-filter.f485460099b037652c3a39d615427d59.png)\n\n## Export a list of accounts\n\nYou can download a CSV list of all accounts in the current view by clicking\n**Export** in the top-right corner of the page.

A\nconnected account can use a remediation link to submit information for open\nrequirements.\n\n## Use Stripe Sigma to identify accounts with open requirements\n\nIf you use [Stripe Sigma](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data), it can identify\naccounts that have open `requirements` or `future_requirements`. For information\nabout querying for Connect information with Sigma, see [Query Connect\ndata](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data/query-connect-data).\n\n## Review individual accounts\n\nTo investigate the open requirements for an account on the **Accounts to\nreview** page, click the account.
