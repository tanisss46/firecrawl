Select a\npayment method to learn about its level of Connect support.\n\nFor more information about enabling payment methods with Connect, refer to the\nfollowing:\n\n- [Account\ncapabilities](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities#payment-methods)\n- [Adding payment method\ncapabilities](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/payment-methods)\n- [Payment method\nsupport](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/payment-method-support)\n\n## Payment methods\n\nPayment method:ACH Direct DebitAffirmAfterpay / ClearpayAlipayAlmaBank\ntransfersBillieBLIKCapchase PayCash App PayIndonesian bank\ntransfersKlarnaKriyaMB WayMexican installmentsMobilePayMonduMultibancoPay by\nBankPayPalPayToScalapaySeQursSunbitSepa Direct DebitSwishTWINTWechat Pay\nIf you use [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect), you must take the\nfollowing into consideration before you enable and use ACH Direct Debits.\n\n### Request ACH Debit capabilities for your connected accounts\n\nSet the `us_bank_account_ach_payments` capability to `active` on your platform\naccount, and for any connected accounts you want to enable for ACH debits. You\ncan also [request more account\ncapabilities](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities#requesting-unrequesting).\n\n#### Note\n\nStripe automatically refunds the application fee to your platform account when\nthe [destination charge](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges#destination)\nfor an ACH debit fails. Learn about [fees for failed\npayments](https://stripe.com/pricing/local-payment-methods#ach-direct-debit).\n\n### Merchant of record and statement descriptors\n\nThe [charge type](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges) of Connect payments\nmight change the default statement descriptor and the merchant name that appears\non the customer’s bank statement. The charge type can also change:\n\n- The merchant of record shown on the mandate\n- The merchant shown on confirmation emails\n- The merchant shown on microdeposit reminder emails\n\nThe merchant of record determines the Stripe account authorized to create\npayments with a particular\n[PaymentMethod](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object). To learn\nmore about sharing this authorization across multiple connected accounts, see\n[PaymentMethod and Mandate\ncloning](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/payment-method-connect-support#payment-method-and-mandate-cloning).\n\nCharge typeDescriptor taken fromDirectConnected\nAccountDestinationPlatformSeparate charge and transferPlatformDestination (with\n`on_behalf_of`)Connected AccountSeparate charge and transfer (with\n`on_behalf_of`)Connected Account\n### PaymentMethod and mandate cloning\n\nYou can collect customer bank accounts on the platform account and\n[clone](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges-multiple-accounts#clone-and-create-direct-charges)\nACH Direct Debit payment methods. Cloning these methods allows you to save\ncustomer bank accounts for later use on connected accounts. When you clone ACH\nDirect Debit payment methods, Stripe duplicates the mandate authorization to the\nconnected account, but we don’t send any new mandate confirmation emails.\n\n#### Caution\n\nIf a mandate is authorized for a PaymentIntent or SetupIntent\n[on_behalf_of](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges#on_behalf_of) a connected\naccount, you can’t use that mandate with a different connected account.\n\nWhen collecting a bank account that you intend to clone to connected accounts,\nyou must communicate to the customer that their authorization extends to\nconnected accounts on your platform. For example, you can communicate this\nmessage to a customer through the mandate terms. Failure to communicate this\nmessage to your customers could result in customer confusion and increase the\nrisk of disputed payments.\n\n### Connect and settlement\n\nSettlement speed is generally controlled at the platform level.
