Use test mode to:\n\n- Preview tax calculation behavior for different customer locations and\nregistered jurisdictions.\n- Validate that your integration handles automatic tax calculations correctly.\n- Understand zero-tax outcomes.\n[Configure test mode tax\nsettings](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/testing#tax-settings)\nStripe Tax has separate settings for test mode and live mode so you can preview\nchanges to your tax settings before publishing them.\n\nWhen you [Set Up Stripe Tax](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/set-up), make sure you\nenable testing by configuring separate [tax settings in test\nmode](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/tax/settings).\n\n[Add a test mode\nregistration](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/testing#add-registration)\nStripe Tax only calculates tax in jurisdictions where you’ve added a\nregistration. You must add at least one test mode registration to test your\nStripe Tax integration.\n\nSome [product tax codes](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes) are exempt from\nsales tax in certain jurisdictions, which can make them challenging to test. For\nexample, some classes of digital goods are exempt from sales tax in the state of\nCalifornia. When you’re testing your Stripe Tax integration, we recommend adding\ntest mode registrations in states that have fewer product-specific exemptions,\nsuch as Idaho or New Jersey.\n\nTest mode registrations don’t affect live mode tax calculations, so you can\nchange them at any time after you’ve verified that your integration is working\ncorrectly.\n\n[Testing your integration](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/testing#testing)\nAfter you’ve configured your Stripe Tax settings in test mode and added test\nmode registrations, you’re ready to test.\n\nNo-codeLow-codeCustom\nTo test in the Dashboard, create an\n[Invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/dashboard) or [Payment\nLink](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links/create), and make sure the **Use\nautomatic tax calculation** toggle is on.\n\n![Stripe Dashboard with the automatic tax toggle set to\ntrue](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/dashboard_automatic_tax.2338adf39e3a07ad9acd79c036e7c637.png)\n\nStripe Dashboard with the automatic tax toggle set to true\n\n[Review Calculations](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/testing#review-calculations)\n### Using the payment details page\n\n#### Note\n\nThis functionality isn’t available for tax transactions created using the [Tax\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/custom). For transactions recorded using the\nTax API, see [Using the tax transactions\npage](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/testing#tax-transactions-page).\n\nAfter you complete a payment with automatic tax calculation enabled, you can\nreview information about the tax calculation in the Dashboard.\n\n- Navigate to the [Transactions](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments) page in\nthe Dashboard.\n- Click a payment you created with Stripe Tax enabled.\n- Scroll down to the **Automatic tax calculation** section.\n\n![Automatic tax calculation details on a payment in the Stripe\nDashboard](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/automatic_tax_details.353a0264381ad5ed1db691922eb357b2.png)\n\nThe **Automatic tax calculation** section of the payment details screen. Tax\nwasn’t applied to this transaction because there’s no registration for the tax\nlocation.\n\nThe **Taxability** field shows whether tax was collected for a given transaction\nor explains why no tax was applied. For more information about why Stripe Tax\napplies zero tax to some transactions, see [Zero tax\namounts](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/zero-tax).\n\n### Using the tax transactions page\n\nYou can view all tax transactions for your account on the [Tax\nTransactions](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/tax/transactions) page in the\nDashboard.
