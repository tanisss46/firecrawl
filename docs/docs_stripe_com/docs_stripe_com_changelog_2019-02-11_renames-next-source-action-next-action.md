# Renames the next_source_action field for Payment Intents to next_actionBreaking changes

## What’s new

Renames the `next_source_action` property on the PaymentIntent to `next_action`.

## Impact

Update your code to reference `next_action` instead of `next_source_action` when
handling additional actions required for payment processing. This modification

required actions.
