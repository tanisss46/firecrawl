You can set\nthis for all\n[fields](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_payment_element#payment_element_create-options-fields)\nor on specific fields subcomponents, like `name`, `email`, and `address`.\n- `if_required`: Collect only the address fields required for each payment\nmethod to complete the payment.\n- `auto` (default): Stripe determines which billing fields to collect based on\ncustomer friction and authorization success rate for each payment method. You\ndon’t need to pass in additional billing details at confirm time for this mode.\n\nBy default, all fields are set to `auto`. This balances minimizing customer\nfriction and maintaining optimal authorization rates.\n\n## Hide billing details\n\nIf you’re collecting billing details elsewhere outside of the Payment Element,\nyou can use `never` to avoid collecting billing details entirely or to skip\nspecific billing fields. Fields that are set to `never` are hidden for all the\npayment methods. Here’s an example:\n\n```\nconst paymentElement = elements.create('payment', {\n fields: {\n billingDetails: {\n // No address field will be collected in any of the payment method forms\n address: 'never',\n }\n }\n});\n```\n\nWhen `never` is set, you must manually pass in the omitted billing fields at the\nconfirmation time:\n\n```\nstripe.confirmPayment({\n //...Other values\n payment_method: {\n billing_details: {\n address: {\n line1: '123 Main Street',\n city: 'Anytown',\n country: 'US',\n postal_code: '12345'\n },\n }\n } \n});\n```\n\n## Collect minimal billing details\n\nSpecify `if_required` to collect only the billing address fields needed to\ncomplete payment for each payment method.\n\nThis option helps reduce customer friction but might come with certain\ntrade-offs, such as higher network fees, for users on a network cost plus\npricing plan, and potential impacts on authorization rates.\n\n```\nconst paymentElement = elements.create('payment', {\n fields: {\n billingDetails: {\n address: 'if_required',\n }\n }\n});\n```\n\n## Advanced: using Address Element in billing mode\n\nIf your business requires collecting the full billing address, you can use the\n[Address Element](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/address-element) billing mode\nin combination with the Payment Element. The billing details gathered in Address\nElement are automatically attached at the confirmation time.\n\n## Links\n\n-\n[fields](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_payment_element#payment_element_create-options-fields)\n- [Address Element](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/address-element)",
