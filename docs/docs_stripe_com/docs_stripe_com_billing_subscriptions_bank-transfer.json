Create a product and a recurring price by following the steps in\nthe [product and prices\nguide](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/getting-started). Save the price\nID—you’ll need it later in this guide.\n\n[Create or retrieve a\ncustomerServer-side](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/bank-transfer#create-customer)\nTo start, create a [customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers) with a\nvalid email address, if one doesn’t already exist. The valid email address\nensures that the customer can receive invoices you send to them. Funds from bank\ntransfers are held in the customer’s [cash\nbalance](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/customer-balance), so you have to\nassociate a [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers) object with each\nbank transfer subscription.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d name=\"Jenny Rosen\" \\\n --data-urlencode email=\"jenny.rosen@example.com\"\n```\n\n[Create the\nsubscriptionServer-side](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/bank-transfer#create-subscription)\n[Create](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/create) the subscription\nusing the customer ID and price ID from the previous steps.\n\n- Set\n[collection_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/create#create_subscription-collection_method)\nto `send_invoice`.\n- Set\n[days_until_due](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/create#create_subscription-days_until_due)\nto configure how many days the customer has to pay the\n[invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices).\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscriptions \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d customer={{CUSTOMER_ID}} \\\n -d \"items[0][price]\"={{PRICE_ID}} \\\n -d collection_method=send_invoice \\\n -d days_until_due=30 \\\n -d \"payment_settings[payment_method_types][0]\"=customer_balance\n```\n\nAn invoice is sent to the customer when the Subscription is due. The invoice is\nmarked as paid if the customer has enough funds in their [cash\nbalance](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/customer-balance). Otherwise, it\ncontains the necessary information needed for the customer to push funds from\ntheir bank account. This invoice also has a link to the [Hosted Invoice\nPage](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/hosted-invoice-page). Subsequent\ninvoices use the price you created in the first step.\n\nLearn more about [bank transfer\ninvoices](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/bank-transfer).\n\n[OptionalCreate a subscription\nscheduleServer-side](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/bank-transfer#create-subscription-schedule)[Test\nyour\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/bank-transfer#test-your-integration)\nUse the Stripe Dashboard or CLI to simulate an [inbound transfer of\nfunds](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bank-transfers/accept-a-payment#test-your-integration).\n\nAs soon as you receive a fund, Stripe performs\n[automatic](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/bank-transfer#automatic-transfer-reconciliation)\nor\n[manual](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/bank-transfer#manual-reconciliation)\nreconciliation of the invoice.\n\n## Links\n\n- [subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating)\n- [bank transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bank-transfers)\n- [Products](https://docs.stripe.com/api/products)\n- [Prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices)\n- [product and prices\nguide](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/getting-started)\n- [customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers)\n- [cash balance](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/customer-balance)\n- [Create](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/create)\n-\n[collection_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/create#create_subscription-collection_method)\n-\n[days_until_due](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/create#create_subscription-days_until_due)\n- [invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n- [Hosted Invoice Page](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/hosted-invoice-page)\n- [bank transfer invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/bank-transfer)\n- [inbound transfer of\nfunds](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bank-transfers/accept-a-payment#test-your-integration)\n-\n[automatic](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/bank-transfer#automatic-transfer-reconciliation)\n-\n[manual](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/bank-transfer#manual-reconciliation)",
