You might still receive **Webhook\nfailed** emails if you still have an old webhook registered from the previous\nStripe plugin before transitioning to the app. The webhook doesn’t interfere\nwith the app functionality.\n\nTo disable the webhook and stop receiving these emails:\n\n- In the [Dashboard webhooks](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks) page, click\nthe URL for the old webhook from the list.\n- Click the overflow menu () and choose **Delete**.\n- Click **Delete webhook**.\n\n## Synchronization issues\n\nShopware is aware of the following [know\nissues](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/guides/plugins/apps/app-base-guide.html#handling-the-migration-of-shops)\nrelated to shop synchronization.\n\n- If a shop migrates to new servers or otherwise changes its URL, the URL you\nsaved during registration might be invalid, breaking connectivity from the app.\n- If a running **PRODUCTION** shop duplicates its entire database to create a\n**STAGING** environment, it might result in corrupt data because both\nenvironments have the same `shopId`. You might also receive webhooks from both\nshops (prod & staging) that look like they came from the same shop.\n\nYou can resolve these issues by reinstalling the Stripe Payments for Shopware 6\nApp on the **PRODUCTION** environment. This action renews the credentials and\nthe connection between the Stripe Payments for Shopware 6 App and the Shopware\ninstance that you have on **PRODUCTION**.\n\nMake sure the other Shopware instances (such as a STAGING or DEV environment)\nwon’t interfere with the PRODUCTION environment by performing a clean install,\nwith a fresh database. Don’t duplicate it from the PRODUCTION environment.\n\nIf it isn’t possible to use a new database, delete the `core.app.shopId` row\nentry from the `system_config table` to reset the configuration for all\ninstalled applications. Then reinstall the Stripe Payments for Shopware 6 App to\nestablish new IDs and credentials.\n\nTo reinstall the Stripe Payments for Shopware 6 App:\n\n- Open your Shopware instance’s Admin page.\n- In the left panel, navigate to **Extensions** >> **My Extensions**.\n- Find the **Stripe Payments for Shopware 6 App** and click on the overflow menu\n() to open the actions dialog. Then select **Uninstall**.\n- Click **Uninstall**.\n- After the page refreshes, click **Install the App**.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Dashboard webhooks](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)\n- [know\nissues](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/guides/plugins/apps/app-base-guide.html#handling-the-migration-of-shops)",
