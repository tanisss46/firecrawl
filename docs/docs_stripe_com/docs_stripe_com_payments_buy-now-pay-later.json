You’re\npaid immediately and in full and your customers pay nothing or a portion of the\ntotal at purchase time. Buy now, pay later methods are often used by:\n\n- Retailers selling high value goods and services like luxury items or travel\nfares that want to boost conversion.\n- Retailers selling low value goods and services that want to increase average\ncart size and reach new customers who might not have credit cards.\n- Regional banks that allow consumers to split credit card payments over\nmultiple billing cycles.\n\nBuy now, pay later methods might **not** be a good fit for your business if:\n\n- Your customers are businesses. Buy now, pay later methods offered on Stripe\nare only supported for consumers.\n- Your business relies on subscriptions or recurring purchases. Buy now, pay\nlater methods don’t currently support\n[Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing) or\n[Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing).\n\nRead our [Buy Now, Pay Later Guide](https://stripe.com/guides/buy-now-pay-later)\nfor more information.\n\n## Payments\n\nAt checkout, the customer chooses to pay with a buy now, pay later service. Then\nthe customer creates or logs into an account with the buy now, pay later\nprovider. Next, the customer accepts or declines the terms of the repayment\nplan, and then returns to the business’ site.\n\n!\n\n## Product support\n\nPayment\nmethod[Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)[Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout)[Payment\nLinks](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)[Payment\nElement](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element)[Express Checkout\nElement](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/express-checkout-element)[Mobile\nPayment\nElement](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/mobile)[Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/subscriptions)[Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing)[Customer\nPortal](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management)[Affirm](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/affirm)1,2[Afterpay\n(Clearpay)](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/afterpay-clearpay)1,2[Alma](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/alma)1,2[Billie](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/billie)1,2[Capchase\nPay](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/capchase-pay)1,2[Klarna](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/klarna)1,2Private\nPreviewSign\nup[Kriya](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/kriya)1,2[Mondu](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/mondu)1,2[SeQura](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sequra)1,2[Sunbit](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sunbit)1,2[Zip](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/zip)1,2\n1 Not supported when using Checkout in subscription mode.2 Not supported when\nusing Checkout in setup mode.\n\n## API support\n\nPayment methodAPI\nenum[PaymentIntents](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents)[SetupIntents](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/setup-intents)[Manual\ncapture](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/place-a-hold-on-a-payment-method)[Setup\nfuture\nusage](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-during-payment?platform=web&ui=elements)1Requires\nredirect2[Affirm](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/affirm)`affirm`Yes[Afterpay\n(Clearpay)](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/afterpay-clearpay)`afterpay_clearpay`Yes[Alma](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/alma)`alma`Yes[Billie](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/billie)`billie`Yes[Capchase\nPay](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/capchase-pay)`capchase_pay`Yes[Klarna](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/klarna)`klarna`Yes[Kriya](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/kriya)`kriya`Yes[Mondu](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/mondu)`mondu`Yes[SeQura](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sequra)`sequra`Yes[Sunbit](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sunbit)`sunbit`Yes[Zip](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/zip)`zip`Yes\n1 Cards and bank debit methods including SEPA debit, AU BECS direct debit, and\nACSS debit support both `on_session` and `off_session` with [setup future\nusage](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-setup_future_usage).\nAll other payment method types either don’t support `setup_future_usage` or only\nsupport `off_session`.2 Payment methods might require confirmation with\n[return_url](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/confirm#confirm_payment_intent-return_url)\nto indicate where Stripe should redirect your customer after they complete the\npayment.\n\n## Transaction support\n\nPayment methodCustomer countryRepayment optionsTransaction\nlimit[Affirm](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/affirm)1Canada, United States-\nPay in 4 interest-free installments\n- Monthly payments for up to 36 months\n50 USD minimum; 30,000 USD maximum or local\nequivalent-[Afterpay/Clearpay](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/afterpay-clearpay)Australia,\nCanada, New Zealand, United Kingdom, United States- Pay in 4 interest-free\ninstallments\n- Monthly USD payments for up to 12 months\n1 USD minimum; 4,000 USD maximum or local\nequivalent[Klarna](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/klarna)Australia, Austria,\nBelgium, Canada, Czechia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland,\nItaly, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden,\nSwitzerland, United Kingdom, United States- Pay in 3 or 4 interest-free\ninstallments\n- Pay in 30 days\n- Pay now with stored payment details\n- Monthly payments for up to 36 months\n10 USD minimum or local equivalent.
