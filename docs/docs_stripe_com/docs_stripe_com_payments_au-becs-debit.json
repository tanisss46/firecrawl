This gives the business an authorization\nto debit the account. Stripe can generate this mandate for businesses to present\nto their customers.\n\nAustralia BECS Direct Debit is a\n[reusable](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#usage), [delayed\nnotification](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#payment-notification)\npayment method. This means that it can take up to three business days to receive\nnotification on the success or failure of a payment after you initiate a debit\nfrom the customer’s account.\n\nFor new users, Australia BECS Direct Debit transactions have a default limit of\n1,500 AUD per transaction and 4,500 AUD per week. If you need higher limits,\ncontact [support](https://support.stripe.com/contact).\n\nPayment method propertiesBusiness locationsProduct support- **Customer\nlocations**\n\nAustralia\n- **Presentment currency**\n\nAUD\n- **Payment confirmation**\n\nBusiness-intiated\n- **Payment method family**\n\nBank debits\n- **Recurring payments**\n\nYes\n- **Payout timing**\n\nStandard payout timing applies\n- **Connect support**\n\nYes\n- **Dispute support**\n\n[Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/au-becs-debit#disputed-payments)\n- **Manual capture support**\n\nNo\n- **Refunds / Partial refunds**\n\n[Yes / Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/au-becs-debit#refunds)\n\n## Verification requirements\n\nUsing Australia BECS Direct Debit requires you to complete additional [identity\nverification](https://support.stripe.com/questions/common-questions-about-stripe-identity#how-verification-works)\nsteps. We prompt you to complete these steps after you request access from the\n[Payment methods\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods).

If you use our front-end products, Stripe automatically\ndetermines the most relevant payment methods to display. Go to the [Stripe\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and enable\nAustralia BECS Direct Debit. To get started with one of our hosted UIs, follow a\nquickstart:\n\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart): Our prebuilt, hosted\ncheckout page.\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart): Our drop-in UI\ncomponents.\n\n### Other payment products\n\nThe following Stripe products also let you add Australia BECS Direct Debit from\nthe Dashboard:\n\n- [Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/no-code-guide)\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n- [Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview)\n\nIf you prefer to manually list payment methods or want to save Australia BECS\nDirect Debit details for future payments, see the following guides:\n\n- [Accept an Australia BECS Direct Debit\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/au-becs-debit/accept-a-payment)\n- [Save Australia BECS Direct Debit details for future\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/au-becs-debit/set-up-payment)\n\n## Debit notification emails\n\nThe Australia BECS Direct Debit scheme advises that you notify your customer\nwhen a mandate is established and each time you debit their account. By default,\nStripe automatically sends emails to the customer.\n\nIf you decide to send your customer a custom notification:\n\n- Turn off Stripe emails in the [Stripe Dashboard email\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/emails).\n- Use the\n[payment_intent.processing](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-payment_intent.processing)\nevent to trigger debit initiation emails.\n- It’s best to share (a link to) the mandate in the mandate notification\n- The pre-debit notifications ideally includes:\n\n- The last 4 digits of the customer’s bank account\n- The amount to be debited\n- Your contact information\n- The day you plan to debit the customer’s bank account\n- The Australia BECS Direct Debit guidelines suggest sending notifications at\nleast 14 calendar days before you create a payment, but this isn’t mandatory.\nThe default Stripe pre-debit email happens the day before the account gets\ndebited. These pre-debit notifications should help you avoid unnecessary debit\nfailures and disputes. For recurring payments of the same amount (for example, a\n[subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating) of a\nfixed amount), you can include multiple upcoming debits with corresponding dates\nin a single notice.\n\n## Disputes\n\nAustralia BECS Direct Debit provides a dispute process for bank account holders\nto dispute payments so you should familiarize yourself with this process if you\ndecide to accept Australia BECS Direct Debit payments.\n\nFor up to 7 years, a customer can dispute a payment through their bank on a “no\nquestions asked” basis. Their bank honors all disputes within this period. If\nthey dispute a charge and their bank accepts the request to return the funds,\nStripe immediately removes the funds from your Stripe balance.\n\nIf a dispute gets created, Stripe sends both the `charge.dispute.created` and\n`charge.dispute.closed` [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) events, and\ndeducts the amount of the dispute and associated dispute fee from your Stripe\nbalance.\n\nUnlike [credit card disputes](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes), all Australia\nBECS Direct Debit disputes are final and can’t be appealed. If a customer\nsuccessfully disputes a payment, contact them to resolve the situation. If you\ncan come to an agreement and your customer is willing to return the funds to\nyou, they need to make a new payment.\n\n#### Warning\n\nIf you proactively issue your customer a refund while the customer’s bank also\ninitiates the dispute process, your customer might receive two credits for the\nsame transaction. You should follow the [refund\nguidelines](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/au-becs-debit#refunds) to avoid\nthis.\n\n## Mandates\n\nDuring the payment process, businesses must collect a mandate that authorizes\nthem to debit the account. In the Australia BECS Direct Debit system, these\nmandates are called Direct Debit Requests, or DDRs.\n\nBank account holders can request the cancellation of active mandates at any\ntime. To cancel a mandate, a bank account holder must either contact their bank\nor the party they established the mandate with. Canceling a mandate invalidates\nany future debit requests that you issue using it. If you want to accept\nadditional payments from your customer, establish a new mandate with them.\n\n### Mandate events\n\nEvent nameDescription`mandate.updated`Occurs whenever a mandate is canceled by\nthe customer or due to a permanent debit failure. The `status` property will\nchange to `inactive`.\nYou can see the events in your Dashboard, but we recommend you still set up a\n[webhook endpoint](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks).\n\n## Refunds\n\nRefunds for payments made with Australia BECS Direct Debit must be issued within\n90 days from the date of the original payment. Refunds require additional time\nto process (typically 3-5 business days). If you accidentally debit your\ncustomer, contact them immediately to avoid a payment dispute.\n\nRefunds are processed only after the payment process completes. If you create a\nfull or partial refund on a payment that hasn’t completed yet, the refund\nprocess starts when the `Charge` object’s status transitions to `succeeded`. If\nthe `Charge` object’s status transitions to `failed`, the full or partial refund\nis marked as canceled because the money was never debited from the customer’s\nbank account.\n\nAustralia BECS Direct Debit doesn’t explicitly label refunds when they’re\ndeposited back into a bank account. Instead, refunds are processed as a credit\nand include a visible reference to the original payment’s statement descriptor.\n\nDue to longer settlement time periods and how banks process Australia BECS\nDirect Debit transactions, there is potential for confusion between you, your\ncustomer, your customer’s bank, and Stripe. For example, your customer might\ncontact both you and their bank to dispute a payment. If you proactively issue\nyour customer a refund while the customer’s bank also initiates the dispute\nprocess, your customer might receive two credits for the same transaction.\n\nWhen issuing a refund, inform your customer immediately that the refund can take\nup to 5 business days to arrive in their bank account. Stripe won’t\nautomatically send the customer any email to inform them about this.\n\n## Statement descriptors\n\nEvery Australia BECS Direct Debit payment shows two fields on the customers’\nbank statements: the *name of the merchant* and the *lodgement reference* unique\nto this transaction.\n\nFor Australia BECS Direct Debit payments created with Stripe, the name of the\nmerchant is your Stripe account’s [statement\ndescriptor](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/statement-descriptors).\nYou can override this default behavior for every transaction independently by\nusing a [dynamic statement\ndescriptor](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents#dynamic-statement-descriptor).\nTo do so, specify the `statement_descriptor` parameter when creating the\n`PaymentIntent`.\n\n#### Caution\n\nYour statement descriptor gets truncated to the first 9 alphanumeric characters\nin the lodgement reference, followed by a unique ID. For example, if your\nstatement descriptor is `ROCKETRIDES`, the customer will see\n`ROCKETRID_XXXXXXX`.\n\nThe table below illustrates the *merchant name* and *lodgement reference*\nbehavior you can expect on the customer’s bank statement:\n\nDefault statement descriptorDynamic statement descriptorMerchant nameLodgement\nreferenceRocket RidesUnspecified`RocketRides``RocketRid_AB1234CD`Rocket\nRides`Sunday Ride``RocketRides``SundayRid_AB1234CD`\nEach bank in Australia formats these fields differently. Depending on your\ncustomer’s bank, some fields might appear in all lowercase or all uppercase.\n\n### Statement descriptors and Connect\n\nThe charge type of Connect payments changes the statement descriptor and the\nmerchant name, which appear on the customer’s bank statement.\n\nCharge typeDescriptor taken fromDirectConnected\naccountDestinationPlatformSeparate charge and transferPlatformDestination (with\n`on_behalf_of`)Connected accountSeparate charge and transfer (with\n`on_behalf_of`)Connected account\nYou can’t use a mandate collected for a `PaymentIntent` `on_behalf_of` a\nconnected account with a different connected account.\n\n## Smart retries Private preview\n\n## Request early access to Australia BECS Direct Debit smart retries\n\nJoin our private preview.\n\nCollect EmailSign upRead our [privacy policy](https://stripe.com/privacy).\n\n## Links\n\n- [reusable](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#usage)\n- [delayed\nnotification](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#payment-notification)\n- [support](https://support.stripe.com/contact)\n- [identity\nverification](https://support.stripe.com/questions/common-questions-about-stripe-identity#how-verification-works)\n- [Payment methods\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods)\n- [sample code](https://github.com/stripe-samples/au-becs-debit-payment)\n- [Preview Australia BECS Direct Debit payment\nflow](https://codesandbox.io/p/devbox/stripe-sample-au-becs-debit-payment-v0n15)\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart)\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart)\n- [Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/no-code-guide)\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n- [Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview)\n- [Accept an Australia BECS Direct Debit\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/au-becs-debit/accept-a-payment)\n- [Save Australia BECS Direct Debit details for future\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/au-becs-debit/set-up-payment)\n- [Stripe Dashboard email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/emails)\n-\n[payment_intent.processing](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-payment_intent.processing)\n- [subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating)\n- [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks)\n- [credit card disputes](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes)\n- [statement\ndescriptor](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/statement-descriptors)\n- [dynamic statement\ndescriptor](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents#dynamic-statement-descriptor)\n- [privacy policy](https://stripe.com/privacy)",
