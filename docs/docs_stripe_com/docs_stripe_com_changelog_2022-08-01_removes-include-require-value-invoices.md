# Removes the include_and_require value when creating invoicesBreaking changes

## What’s new

The `pending_invoice_items_behavior` parameter on [Create an
invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create) no longer supports the
`include_and_require` value. When the parameter is omitted, the default value of
`pending_invoice_items_behavior` is now `exclude`.

## Impact

Pending invoice items are no longe automatically included, giving you more
control and flexibility in managing pending invoice items when creating
invoices.
