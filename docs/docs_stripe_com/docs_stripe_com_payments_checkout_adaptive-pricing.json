The presentment currency is inferred from the\nbuyer’s public IP address. Enabling Adaptive Pricing can increase conversion\nrates from global buyers and increase international revenue.\n\nUse Adaptive Pricing to:\n\n- Display pricing in local currencies based on location\n- Calculate prices in real-time using an exchange rate guaranteed for 24 hours\n- Unlock payment methods that require local currency\n- Facilitate your compliance when presenting supported currencies\n\n![A customer in France views a price localized from USD to\nEUR](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/adaptive_pricing.7955669ffbb4f3ddeaca083e186eeb99.png)\n\n### Integration effort\n\nLow code\n### Fees\n\nView information on [fees and our\nFAQ](https://support.stripe.com/questions/adaptive-pricing).\n\n[Enable Adaptive\nPricingDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/adaptive-pricing#enable-adaptive-pricing)\nEnable Adaptive Pricing in your [payment\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/adaptive-pricing) in the\nDashboard. You can enable Adaptive Pricing in a sandbox and live mode. Disabling\nAdaptive Pricing doesn’t affect Checkout Sessions that have already been\nconverted.\n\nAdaptive Pricing works with Checkout, Payment Links, pricing tables, and local\npayment methods.\n\n[Configure local payment\nmethodsDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/adaptive-pricing#configure-local-payment-methods)\nYou can configure which payment methods you accept in your [payment methods\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods). Adaptive\nPricing can increase the usage of local payment methods by ensuring customers\nhave the option to pay in their currency and with payment methods most relevant\nto them. As an example, 70% of all e-commerce transactions in the Netherlands\nuse iDEAL, but it only works with EUR. Adaptive Pricing enables the following\npayment methods:\n\n- Alipay\n- Bancontact\n- BLIK\n- Canadian pre-authorized debit\n- EPS\n- iDEAL\n- Link\n- PayPal\n- P24\n- SEPA Debit\n- Sofort\n- Swish\n- WeChat Pay\n[Event destinations and\nreportingServer-side](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/adaptive-pricing#event-destinations-reporting)\nEnabling Adaptive Pricing can affect some parts of your integration, such as\nevent destinations and reporting. Review your integration to make sure any\n[event\ndestinations](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/adaptive-pricing#event-destinations-reporting)\ncan handle PaymentIntent objects with local currencies.\n\n- Use the\n[currency_conversion](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object#checkout_session_object-currency_conversion)\nhash on the Checkout Session object to determine what your customer would have\npaid in the default currency.\n- Use the [BalanceTransactions\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api/balance_transactions) to determine how much you\nreceive after fees.\n\nDepending on the user-selected currency, both the Checkout Session and the\nunderlying PaymentIntent objects update automatically to reflect the selected\ncurrency and amount. After a user pays in local currency, the Checkout Session\nobject’s currency and total amount is in local currency and contains a\n`currency_conversion` hash to reflect what the user would have paid in the\ndefault currency. Learn more about what’s [deposited in your account after\nfees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/balance_transactions).\n\nThe\n[checkout.session.completed](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-checkout.session.completed)\nevent contains a `currency_conversion` hash that includes the `amount_total` and\n`amount_subtotal` in the `source_currency`. The amounts reflect what your\ncustomer would have paid in the source currency.\n\n```\n{\n \"id\": '{{EVENT_ID}}',\n \"object\": \"event\",\n \"type\": \"checkout.session.completed\",\n \"data\": {\n \"object\": {\n \"id\": '{{SESSION_ID}}',\n \"object\": \"checkout.session\",\n \"currency\": \"cad\",\n \"amount_total\": 2055,\n \"amount_subtotal\": 2055,\n \"currency_conversion\": {\n \"amount_subtotal\": 1500,\n \"amount_total\": 1500,\n \"source_currency\": \"usd\",\n \"fx_rate\": \"1.37\"\n }\n }\n }\n}\n```\n\n[Testing](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/adaptive-pricing#testing)\nTo test local currency presentment for Checkout, Payment Links, and the [pricing\ntable](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/pricing-table), pass in a\nlocation-formatted customer email that includes a suffix in a `+location_XX`\nformat in the local part of the email. `XX` must be a valid [two-letter ISO\ncountry code](https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/country_code_list.htm).\n\nFor example, to test currency presentment for a customer in France, pass in an\nemail like `test+location_FR@example.com`.\n\nWhen you visit the URL for a Checkout Session, Payment Link, or pricing table\ncreated with a location-formatted email, you see the same currency as a customer\ndoes in the specified country.\n\n### Testing Checkout\n\nWhen you create a Checkout Session, pass the location-formatted email as\n[customer_email](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object#checkout_session_object-customer_email)\nto simulate Checkout from a particular country.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/checkout/sessions \\\n -u sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2: \\\n -d \"line_items[0][price]\"=\"{{PRICE_ID}}\" \\\n -d \"line_items[0][quantity]\"=1 \\\n -d mode=payment \\\n -d success_url=\"https://example.com/success\" \\\n --data-urlencode customer_email=\"test+location_FR@example.com\"\n```\n\nYou can also create a [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/create)\nand specify their email that contains the `+location_XX` suffix. Stripe test\ncards work as usual.\n\nWhen it’s possible to present the customer’s local currency in Checkout, the\n[Checkout Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object) object\nchanges. Fields like `currency`, `payment_method_types`, and `amount_total`\nreflect the local currency and price.\n\n### Testing Payment Links\n\nFor Payment Links, pass the location-formatted email as the `prefilled_email`\n[URL\nparameter](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links/customize#customize-checkout-with-url-parameters)\nto test currency presentment for customers in different countries.\n\n### Testing Pricing table\n\nFor the pricing table, pass the location-formatted email as the\n[customer-email](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/pricing-table#customer-email)\nattribute to test currency presentment for customers in different countries.\n\n## Supported currencies\n\nBusinesses in supported regions can automatically convert prices to the local\ncurrencies of their customers in the following markets:\n\n### North America\n\n### South America\n\n### Europe\n\n### Asia\n\n### Oceania\n\n### Africa\n\n## Restrictions\n\nAdaptive Pricing doesn’t currently work with Connect or Elements with the\nPayment Intents API.\n\nAdditionally, Adaptive Pricing requires the [currency for your\nprices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object#checkout_session_object-currency)\nto be the same as your default settlement currency. Prices automatically convert\nduring checkout. This applies to\n[prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/manage-prices#prices-create)\nyou create and reference with a price ID and prices you create inline with\n[price_data](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-line_items-price_data)\nwhen you create a Checkout Session.\n\nAdaptive Pricing doesn’t apply for Checkout Sessions that:\n\n- Contain explicitly defined [manual currency\nprices](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/manual-currency-prices).\n- Are in `subscription` mode.\n- Use Connect parameters like `application_fee_amount`, `on_behalf_of`, and\n`transfer_data`.\n- Use\n[capture_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-payment_intent_data-capture_method)\nas `manual`.\n- Set the\n[currency](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-currency)\nvalue on creation.\n- Use [custom\namounts](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/pay-what-you-want).\n- Present the customer a local currency that is also configured as a [settlement\ncurrency](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts#supported-accounts-and-settlement-currencies).\nFor example, suppose an account settles in both `EUR` and `GBP`. If they price\nin `EUR`, customers with local currency `GBP` don’t see Adaptive Pricing.\nCustomers with a local currency other than `EUR` or `GBP`, such as `JPY`, see\nAdaptive Pricing.\n\nCheckout Sessions that aren’t supported by Adaptive Pricing present prices in\nthe original currency that you’ve set your prices in.\n\n## Pricing\n\n- You pay 0\n- Your buyers pay 2-4\n\nYou (the business) don’t directly pay any additional fees for Adaptive Pricing,\nas all such fees are paid for by your customers. Stripe applies a conversion fee\nof between 2-4% to the exchange rate you present to your customers, increasing\ntheir purchase price by a corresponding amount. The fee applied is determined by\nStripe and varies for the purposes of increasing customer conversion. Stripe\ntypically charges a fee of 4% for orders under 500 USD, 3% for 500–1,500 USD,\nand 2% for orders over 1,500 USD. For detailed information about current Stripe\nfees, see our [pricing page](https://stripe.com/pricing).\n\n## Exchange rate\n\nStripe uses the mid-market exchange rate and applies a fee to guarantee the rate\nfor the duration of the Checkout Session (up to 24 hours) through settlement. If\nthe exchange rate changes by more than 5% in that time, Stripe might use the\nupdated exchange rate to calculate your payout.\n\nLearn more about how Stripe handles [currency\nconversions](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies/conversions) and [Adaptive\nPricing\nfees](https://support.stripe.com/questions/adaptive-pricing#:~:text=Adaptive%20Pricing%20is%20a%20Checkout,latest%20Stripe%2Dprovided%20exchange%20rates).\n\n## Refunds\n\nStripe pays out refunds in the currency your customer pays in using the latest\nStripe-provided exchange rate. This means that you might pay more or less to\ncover the refund depending on how the exchange rate changes.\n\n### Example refund\n\nWe ignore Stripe fees in this example for simplicity. Suppose:\n\n- You’re a US business that uses Checkout to sell a product for 100 USD and have\nactivated Adaptive Pricing.\n- A customer in Canada views your Checkout page, sees the localized price of 137\nCAD at an exchange rate of 1.37 CAD per 1 USD, and completes the purchase.\n- Stripe processes the payment, converting the 137 CAD to 100 USD to pay you in\nyour settlement currency.\n- Later, when the exchange rate has changed to 1.40 CAD per 1 USD, you issue a\nfull refund to the customer.\n- Stripe deducts 97.86 USD from your account, exchanging it at 1.40 CAD per 1\nUSD to pay out the 137 CAD refund.\n\nLearn more about how Stripe helps you manage\n[refunds](https://docs.stripe.com/refunds).\n\n## See also\n\n- [Adaptive Pricing FAQ](https://support.stripe.com/questions/adaptive-pricing)\n\n## Links\n\n- [fees and our FAQ](https://support.stripe.com/questions/adaptive-pricing)\n- [payment settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/adaptive-pricing)\n- [payment methods\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods)\n-\n[currency_conversion](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object#checkout_session_object-currency_conversion)\n- [BalanceTransactions API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/balance_transactions)\n-\n[checkout.session.completed](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-checkout.session.completed)\n- [pricing table](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/pricing-table)\n- [two-letter ISO country\ncode](https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/country_code_list.htm)\n-\n[customer_email](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object#checkout_session_object-customer_email)\n- [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/create)\n- [Checkout Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object)\n- [URL\nparameter](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links/customize#customize-checkout-with-url-parameters)\n-\n[customer-email](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/pricing-table#customer-email)\n- [currency for your\nprices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object#checkout_session_object-currency)\n- [prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/manage-prices#prices-create)\n-\n[price_data](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-line_items-price_data)\n- [manual currency\nprices](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/manual-currency-prices)\n-\n[capture_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-payment_intent_data-capture_method)\n-\n[currency](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-currency)\n- [custom amounts](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/pay-what-you-want)\n- [settlement\ncurrency](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts#supported-accounts-and-settlement-currencies)\n- [pricing page](https://stripe.com/pricing)\n- [currency conversions](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies/conversions)\n- [Adaptive Pricing\nfees](https://support.stripe.com/questions/adaptive-pricing#:~:text=Adaptive%20Pricing%20is%20a%20Checkout,latest%20Stripe%2Dprovided%20exchange%20rates)\n- [refunds](https://docs.stripe.com/refunds)",
