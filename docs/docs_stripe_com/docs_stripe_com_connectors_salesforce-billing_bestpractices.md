# Best practices for using Stripe with Salesforce Billing

## Learn how to set up Stripe with Salesforce billing.

Use the information in this guide to learn how to import data, use payment
center, test cards in payment center, and set batch size for optimal
performance.

## Data import options

You can add payment methods using the quick action on the Payment Methods
related list, which you can access from the Account record. If you need
additional help, refer to the Installation and Configuration guide.

## Data import scenarios

You can also add Stripe customer data in other ways, such as with a data import
using information from Stripe or by using a custom script. If you use these
options, you need to make sure that you have certain values present in the
Salesforce records.

See the following data import scenarios, and use whichever one best fits your
use case for importing data.

## Import customers and payment methods

To import customers and payment methods, the Salesforce Admin needs to do the
following:

- Import Customer records (required fields).- Account Name
- Stripe [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/retrieve) ID
- Import payment method records (required fields).- Payment Gateway record ID
- Active checkbox set to True
- Payment Gateway Token

## Import existing customer and payment methods

To import existing customers and payment methods, the Salesforce Admin needs to
do the following:

- Insert the Account record:- Because the Account records already exist in
Salesforce, Account records updated with the Stripe
[Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/retrieve) ID. There are
multiple ways to match to an existing Account (such as an ID or Account Name).
- Import payment methods required fields.- Payment Gateway record ID
- Active checkbox set to **True**
- Payment Gateway Token
- Stripe [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/retrieve) ID

## Import only payment methods

To import only payment methods, the Salesforce Admin needs to do the following:

- Import the required fields for payment methods.- Payment Gateway record ID
- Active checkbox set to **True**
- Payment Gateway Token

## Create a Payment Method from the Payment Center

From Salesforce a user can create a payment in the payment center. The connector
doesnâ€™t support creating and charging Payment Methods simultaneously from the
Payment Center.

This problem occurs when a new payment is entered, and save this payment for
later use is selected.

## Increase Salesforce throughput for batch payments in Salesforce Billing

Stripe recommends setting the Payment creation batch size in Salesforce Billing
to the upper limit, which is currently 70.

- Navigate to Salesforce Setup and search for installed packages.
- Click **Configure** next to the Salesforce Billing package.
- Navigate to the **Payment** tab.
- Adjust the Payment creation batch size as needed.
