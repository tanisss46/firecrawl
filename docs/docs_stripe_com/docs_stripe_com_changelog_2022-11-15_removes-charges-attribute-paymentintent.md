# Removes the charges attribute from the PaymentIntent objectBreaking changes

## What’s new

Removes the `charges` property on the
[PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object) object. Use
the `latest_charge` property instead.

## Impact

Lets you access the most recent charge associated with a PaymentIntent using
`latest_charge`, instead of relying on the now-removed `charges` attribute. This
simplifies the way you retrieve charge information for a PaymentIntent.
