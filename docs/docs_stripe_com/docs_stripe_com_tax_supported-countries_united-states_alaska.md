# Collect tax in Alaska

## Learn how to use Stripe Tax to calculate, collect, and report tax in Alaska.

## When to register for tax collection

Alaska doesn’t have a state sales tax. However local jurisdictions within Alaska
may impose a sales and use tax. Each jurisdiction can define what it means to be
doing business in that location and whether sales tax applies. Many local
jurisdictions in Alaska have chosen to adopt the [Alaska Remote Seller Sales Tax
Commission (ARSSTC)](https://arsstc.org/business-sellers/) uniform tax code.
This includes using state-wide thresholds to determine whether a business needs
to pay tax there.

Remote sellers must register to collect and remit tax in Alaska when, in the
previous or current calendar year, they meet or exceed a sales threshold of
100,000 USD.

The threshold includes gross sales, including marketplace sales.

Alaska’s economic nexus law differs from other economic nexus laws. The state
passed the Alaska Remote Seller Sales Tax Code on January 6, 2020. However,
local jurisdictions decide whether to adopt the code. After a local jurisdiction
adopts the code, businesses have 30 days to begin collecting sales tax from
Alaska buyers in that jurisdiction.

See [Thresholds](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/thresholds) to get insights
about your sales into the state and potential tax registration obligations in
Alaska. Stripe also notifies you with email and Dashboard alerts when you need
to register to collect tax. Learn more about how the [monitoring tool
works](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/monitoring).

## How we calculate taxes

Stripe calculates the taxes that apply to your customer’s location.

For businesses based in Alaska, Stripe calculates tax in all local jurisdictions
that levy tax. For remote businesses selling to customers in Alaska, Stripe
calculates taxes in local jurisdictions that enacted state-wide thresholds for
sales tax registration. The Alaska Remote Seller Sales Tax Commission (ARSSTC)
maintains a list of jurisdictions that have enacted the model code with the
statewide thresholds on the [ARSSTC
website](https://arsstc.org/business-sellers/member-jurisdictions/).

## Report and file your taxes

Stripe provides reports of your completed tax transactions. Go to
[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations) to access these
reports.

### Exports

The tax transaction data export provides a comprehensive and aggregated view of
transactions by location, including a breakdown of individual tax amounts. Learn
more about [tax reporting exports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports#exports).

### Location reports

Alaska doesn’t impose any state sales or use tax. However, local jurisdictions
can apply these taxes. A location report isn’t available to view these details.
Instead, use the [exports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports#exports) to
obtain a detailed breakdown of local jurisdiction sales and use tax.

### Filing

Stripe Tax has filing partners—Taxually, Marosa, and Hands-off Sales Tax
(HOST)—to help automate your tax filing. These partners automatically sync your
tax transaction data in real time, eliminating the need for manual data entry or
file transfers. Learn more about [tax
filing](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/filing).
