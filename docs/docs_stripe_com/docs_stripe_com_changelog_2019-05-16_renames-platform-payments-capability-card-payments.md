# Bank pull payments no longer expose internal system refunds on failureBreaking changes

## What’s new

Bank pull payments no longer expose internal system refunds on failure. You can
still access system refunds through the [List
refunds](https://docs.stripe.com/api/refunds/list#list_refunds-charge) endpoint.

## Impact

This change removes the visibility of internal system refunds for failed bank
pull payments from the main payment interface. You no longer see these automatic
refunds directly in the payment data, but can still access them through the
`List refunds` endpoint.
