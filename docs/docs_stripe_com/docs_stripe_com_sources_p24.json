  "content": "# Przelewy24 payments with SourcesDeprecated\n\n## Use Sources to accept payments using Przelewy24, the most popular payment method in Poland.\n\n#### Warning\n\nWe deprecated the Sources API and plan to remove support for local payment\nmethods. If you currently integrate with Przelewy24 using the Sources API, you\nmust [migrate to the Payment Methods\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/transitioning).\n\nFor information about integrating Przelewy24 with the current APIs, see\n[Przelewy24 payments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/p24).\n\nStripe users in Europe and the United States can accept\n[Przelewy24](https://www.przelewy24.pl/) payments from customers in Poland using\n[Sources](https://docs.stripe.com/sources).\n\nDuring the payment process, a [Source](https://docs.stripe.com/api#sources)\nobject is created and your customer is redirected to their bank’s website or\nmobile application to authorize the payment. After completing this, your\nintegration uses the source to make a charge request and complete the payment.\n\nPrzelewy24 is a\n[push](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#pull-or-push-of-funds)-based,\n[single-use](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#single-use-or-reusable) and\n[synchronous](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#synchronous-or-asynchronous-confirmation)\nmethod of payment. This means your customer takes action to send the amount to\nyou through a\n[redirect](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#flow-for-customer-action) and there\nis immediate confirmation about the success or failure of a payment.\n\n[Create a Source object](https://docs.stripe.com/sources/p24#create-source)\nA `Source` object is either created client-side using\n[Stripe.js](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements) or server-side using the\n[Source creation endpoint](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_source), with the\nfollowing parameters:\n\nParameterValue`type`p24`amount`A positive integer in the [smallest currency\nunit](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#zero-decimal) representing the amount\nto charge the customer (for example, 1099 for a 10.99 EUR payment).`currency`eur\nor pln (Przelewy24 payments must be in either Euros or Polish\nZloty).`owner[name]` (optional)The name of the account holder.`owner[email]`The\nemail address of the account holder.`redirect[return_url]`The URL the customer\nshould be redirected to after the authorization process.`statement_descriptor`\n(optional)A custom statement descriptor for the payment.\nTo create a source with [Stripe.js](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements),\nfirst include the library within your website and set your [publishable API\nkey](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys). Once included, use the following\n`createSource` method to create a source client-side:\n\n```\nstripe.createSource({\n type: 'p24',\n amount: 1099,\n currency: 'eur',\n owner: {\n name: 'Jenny Rosen',\n email: 'jenny.rosen@example.com',\n },\n redirect: {\n return_url: '__TOKEN_PLACEHOLDER_0__',\n },\n}).then(function(result) {\n // handle result.error or result.source\n});\n```\n\nUsing either method, Stripe returns a `Source` object containing the relevant\ndetails for the method of payment used. Information specific to Przelewy24 is\nprovided within the `p24` subhash.\n\n```\n{\n \"id\": \"src_16xhynE8WzK49JbAs9M21jaR\",\n \"object\": \"source\",\n \"amount\": 1099,\n \"client_secret\": \"src_client_secret_UfwvW2WHpZ0s3QEn9g5x7waU\",\n \"created\": 1445277809,\n \"currency\": \"eur\",\n \"flow\": \"redirect\",\n \"livemode\": true,\n \"owner\": {\n```\n\nSee all 32 lines\n### Source creation in mobile applications\n\nIf you’re building an iOS or Android app, you can implement sources using our\nmobile SDKs. Refer to our sources documentation for\n[iOS](https://docs.stripe.com/mobile/ios/sources) or\n[Android](https://docs.stripe.com/mobile/android/sources) to learn more.\n\n### Statement descriptors with Przelewy24\n\nPrzelewy24 lets you provide a custom [statement\ndescriptor](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/activate#public-business-information)\nbefore the customer is redirected to authenticate the payment. It can be\nspecified by providing `statement_descriptor` when creating a source.\n\nAdditionally, when the customer approves the payment, a unique reference will be\nstored on the Source under `p24[reference]`. You can share this reference with\nyour customer to help locate payments.\n\nProviding a custom statement descriptor within a subsequent charge request has\nno effect.\n\n### Error codes\n\nSource creation for Przelewy24 payments may return any of the following errors:\n\nErrorDescription`payment_method_not_available`The payment method is currently\nnot available. You should invite your customer to fallback to another payment\nmethod to proceed.`processing_error`An unexpected error occurred preventing us\nfrom creating the source. The source creation should be\nretried.`invalid_owner_email`The owner email address is invalid. It must be a\nvalid email address.`invalid_currency`The currency is not supported for\nPrzelewy24. It must either be `'eur'` or `'pln'`.[Have the customer authorize\nthe payment](https://docs.stripe.com/sources/p24#customer-action)\nWhen creating a source, its status is initially set to `pending` and cannot yet\nbe used to make a charge request. Your customer must authorize a Przelewy24\npayment to make the source chargeable. To allow your customer to authorize the\npayment, redirect them to the URL provided within the`redirect[url]` attribute\nof the `Source` object.\n\nAfter the authorization process, your customer is redirected back to the URL\nprovided as a value of `redirect[return_url]`. This happens regardless of\nwhether authorization was successful or not. If the customer has authorized the\npayment, the `Source` object’s status is updated to `chargeable` and it is ready\nto use in a charge request. If your customer declines the payment, the status\ntransitions to `failed`.\n\nStripe populates the `redirect[return_url]` with the following GET parameters\nwhen returning your customer to your website:\n\n- `source`: a string representing the original ID of the `Source` object\n- `livemode`: indicates if this is a live payment, either `true` or `false`\n- `client_secret`: used to confirm that the returning customer is the same one\nwho triggered the creation of the source (source IDs are not considered secret)\n\nYou may include any other GET parameters you may need when specifying\n`redirect[return_url]`. Do not use the above as parameter names yourself as\nthese would be overridden with the values we populate.\n\n### Mobile applications\n\nTo integrate Przelewy24 within a mobile application, provide your application\nURI scheme as the `redirect[return_url]` value. By doing so, your customers are\nreturned to your app after completing authorization. Refer to our Sources\ndocumentation for [iOS](https://docs.stripe.com/mobile/ios/sources) or\n[Android](https://docs.stripe.com/mobile/android/sources) to learn more.\n\nIf you are integrating without using our mobile SDKs, the redirect URL must be\nopened using the device’s native browser. The use of in-app web views and\ncontainers can prevent your customer from completing authentication—resulting in\na lower conversion rate.\n\n### Testing the redirect process\n\nWhen creating a `Source` object using your test API keys, you can follow the URL\nreturned in the `redirect[url]` field. This leads to a Stripe page that displays\ninformation about the API request, and where you can either authorize or cancel\nthe payment. Authorizing the payment redirects you to the URL specified in\n`redirect[return_url]`.\n\nAlternatively, to accelerate testing, use the following value for\n`owner[email]`, where `xxx_` is any prefix of your choice (these patterns are\nsignificant only in testmode):\n\nEmail AddressEffect`xxx_chargeable@example.com`The source will be created as\n`pending`, but automatically transition to `chargeable` within seconds of its\ncreation.[Charge the Source](https://docs.stripe.com/sources/p24#charge-request)\nOnce the customer has authenticated the payment, the source’s `status`\ntransitions to `chargeable` and it can be used to make a charge request. This\ntransition happens asynchronously and may occur after the customer was\nredirected back to your website.\n\nSome customers using Przelewy24 assume that the order process is complete once\nthey have authenticated the payment and received confirmation from their bank.\nThis results in customers who close their browser instead of following the\nredirect and returning to your app or website.\n\nFor these reasons it is essential that your integration rely on\n[webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) to determine when the source\nbecomes chargeable in order to create a charge. Please refer to our [best\npractices](https://docs.stripe.com/sources/best-practices) for more details on\nhow to best integrate payment methods using webhooks.\n\n### Webhooks\n\nThe following webhook events are sent to notify you about changes to the\nsource’s status:\n\nEventDescription`source.chargeable`A `Source` object becomes `chargeable` after\na customer has authenticated and verified a payment.`source.failed`A `Source`\nobject failed to become chargeable as your customer declined to authenticate the\npayment.`source.canceled`A `Source` object expired and cannot be used to create\na charge.\n### Make a charge request using the source\n\nOnce the source is chargeable, from your `source.chargeable` webhook handler,\nyou can make a charge request using the source ID as the value for the `source`\nparameter to complete the payment.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/charges \\\n -u sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2: \\\n -d amount=\"1099\" \\\n -d currency=\"eur\" \\\n -d source=src_18eYalAHEMiOZZp1l9ZTjSU0\n```\n\nPrzelewy24 Sources are\n[single-use](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#single-use-or-reusable) and cannot\nbe used for recurring or additional payments. Refer to our [Sources &\nCustomers](https://docs.stripe.com/sources/customers) guide for more information\non how single-use Sources interact with\n[Customers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers).\n\n[Confirm that the charge has\nsucceeded](https://docs.stripe.com/sources/p24#charge-confirmation)\nSince Przelewy24 is a\n[synchronous](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#synchronous-or-asynchronous-confirmation)\npayment method and the customer has already authenticated the payment as part of\nthe redirect, unless there is an unexpected error, the\n[Charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api#charge_object) will immediately succeed.\n\nEventDescription`charge.succeeded`The charge succeeded and the payment is\ncomplete.\nWe recommend that you rely on the `charge.succeeded` webhook event to notify\nyour customer that the payment process has been completed and their order is\nconfirmed. Please refer to our [best\npractices](https://docs.stripe.com/sources/best-practices) for more details on\nhow to best integrate payment methods using webhooks.\n\n### Disputed payments\n\nThe risk of fraud or unrecognized payments is extremely low with Przelewy24 as\nthe customer must authenticate the payment with their bank. As such, there is no\ndispute process that can result in a chargeback and funds withdrawn from your\nStripe account.\n\n### Refunds\n\nPayments made with Przelewy24 can only be submitted for refund within 180 days\nfrom the date of the original charge. After 180 days, it is no longer possible\nto refund the charge.\n\n### Sources expiration\n\nA `chargeable` Przelewy24 source must be charged within six hours of becoming\n`chargeable`. If it is not, its status is automatically transitioned to\n`canceled` and your integration receives a `source.canceled` webhook event. Once\na chargeable source is canceled, the customer’s authenticated Przelewy24 payment\nis refunded automatically—no money is moved into your account. For this reason,\nmake sure the order is canceled on your end and the customer is notified when\nyou receive the `source.canceled` event.\n\nAdditionally, `pending` sources are canceled after 1 hour if they aren’t used to\nauthenticate a payment to make sure that all sources transition out of their\n`pending` state to the `canceled` state if they aren’t used.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Other supported payment methods](https://docs.stripe.com/sources)\n- [Sources API reference](https://docs.stripe.com/api#sources)\n- [Best practices](https://docs.stripe.com/sources/best-practices)\n\n## Links\n\n- [migrate to the Payment Methods\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/transitioning)\n- [Przelewy24 payments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/p24)\n- [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/payments/settings)\n- [Przelewy24](https://www.przelewy24.pl)\n- [Sources](https://docs.stripe.com/sources)\n- [Source](https://docs.stripe.com/api#sources)\n- [push](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#pull-or-push-of-funds)\n- [single-use](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#single-use-or-reusable)\n-\n[synchronous](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#synchronous-or-asynchronous-confirmation)\n- [redirect](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#flow-for-customer-action)\n- [Stripe.js](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements)\n- [Source creation endpoint](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_source)\n- [smallest currency unit](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#zero-decimal)\n- [publishable API key](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys)\n- [iOS](https://docs.stripe.com/mobile/ios/sources)\n- [Android](https://docs.stripe.com/mobile/android/sources)\n- [statement\ndescriptor](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/activate#public-business-information)\n- [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks)\n- [best practices](https://docs.stripe.com/sources/best-practices)\n- [Sources & Customers](https://docs.stripe.com/sources/customers)\n- [Customers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers)\n- [Charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api#charge_object)",
