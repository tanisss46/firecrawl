# File uploads describe their file type with the simpler type field and formatBreaking changes

## What’s new

Removes the `mimetype` property from the `File Upload` object. This now returns
simplified file types in the `type` property and uses simpler naming conventions
than mimetypes (`type` contains `pdf` instead of `application/pdf`).

## Impact

This change allows you to work with simplified file type information in the
`File Upload` object.
