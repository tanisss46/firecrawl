For example, use this feature if you want to create and fill out\nyour invoice at a particular time, but have that invoice finalized and sent out\nor charged at a future time. You can edit this draft invoice up until it\nautomatically finalizes, or you can turn off scheduled finalization if needed.\nAt the time you schedule, Stripe attempts to finalize this invoice, which\nsucceeds if no\n[errors](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/scheduled-finalization#pitfalls)\narise during finalization.\n\n#### Caution\n\nWhen you use a custom finalization time for invoices, finalization won’t be\ndelayed because of `invoice.created` webhook failures. This is different from\nthe behavior described in the [Webhooks and\ninvoices](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/webhooks#understand)\nguidance.\n\n## Before you begin\n\nTo configure an automatic finalization time for an invoice, you must have\n[automatic invoice\nadvancement](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection)\nenabled for the invoice. Dashboard scheduled invoices have this enabled\nautomatically. If you don’t pass in a value for `automatically_finalizes_at`\nwhen enabling automatic invoice advancement in the API, Stripe calculates and\nsets the time according to the [configurable grace\nperiod](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based/configure-grace-period)\nyou currently have set. Turning off automatic advancement disables the invoice\nfrom being automatically charged or sent. Learn more about this in [Pause\ninvoice\nadvancement](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection#pausing-auto-collection).\n\n## Schedule a one-off invoice to finalize in the future\n\nDashboardAPI\nFor a draft invoice, specify the time that you want the invoice to be finalized.\n\n- After selecting the payment collection type, toggle on the **Schedule send\ndate** or **Schedule charge date** option\n- In the confirmation modal, after choosing a date, click **Schedule** to finish\nscheduling your invoice.\n- The page refreshes to show that the invoice has been successfully scheduled.\n\nFor an existing draft invoice that’s already scheduled, click **Reschedule\ninvoice** to change the date that the invoice is scheduled to be finalized\nautomatically.\n\n## Viewing scheduled invoices\n\nYou can view scheduled invoices in the Dashboard in a few ways:\n\n- Filter invoices for whether or not they have scheduled invoice finalization\nenabled, based on the `Scheduled finalization` column and `Scheduled\nfinalization date` filter on the\n[Invoices](https://dashboard.stripe.com/invoices) page.\n- In the **Details** section of a page for a specific invoice, the `Finalizes\nat` property indicates when that invoice is scheduled to be finalized.\n\n## Subscription invoice usage\n\nInvoices generated by subscriptions are already scheduled for finalization upon\ninvoice creation, based on the [configurable grace\nperiod](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based/configure-grace-period)\nyou currently have set. Turning off automatic advancement disables the invoice\nfrom being automatically charged or sent to the user. Learn how to [pause\ninvoice\nadvancement](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection#pausing-auto-collection)\nfor any you have set. You can modify these invoices using the process described\nhere, but make sure you consider the following:\n\n- Non-finalized invoices remain in a draft state. This means that pushing this\nscheduled finalization date out further potentially increases the time that\ncustomers could have an active subscription without having an invoice be sent or\ncharged to them.\n- Modifying this time won’t cause invoice finalization to be delayed based on\nfailure to respond to `invoice.created` webhooks. If you want to depend on\nwebhook failures delaying invoice finalization, don’t modify this\n`automatically_finalizes_at` field.\n\n## Common pitfalls\n\nThis feature has some common pitfalls to be aware of:\n\n- If the invoice has `automatic_tax[enabled]=true` but the customer doesn’t have\nsufficient tax information, automatic finalization fails. Learn more about\n[invoice finalization\nerrors](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/customer-locations#finalizing-invoices-with-finalization-failures)\nand how to resolve this issue.\n- The **Send finalized invoices and credit notes to customers** setting must be\nenabled in [Subscriptions and emails\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/automatic) if you want\nemails for automatically finalized invoices to send to customers.- This ability\nof sending emails for automatically finalized invoices is only available in live\nmode.\n\n## Links\n\n-\n[finalized](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/workflow-transitions)\n- [Webhooks and\ninvoices](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/webhooks#understand)\n- [automatic invoice\nadvancement](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection)\n- [configurable grace\nperiod](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based/configure-grace-period)\n- [Pause invoice\nadvancement](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection#pausing-auto-collection)\n- [Invoices](https://dashboard.stripe.com/invoices)\n- [invoice finalization\nerrors](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/customer-locations#finalizing-invoices-with-finalization-failures)\n- [Subscriptions and emails\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/automatic)",
