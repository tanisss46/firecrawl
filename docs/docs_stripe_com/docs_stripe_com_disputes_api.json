  "content": "# Use the API to respond to disputes\n\n## Learn how to manage disputes programmatically.\n\nYou can respond to disputes in the Stripe Dashboard, where we guide you through\nsubmitting the optimal evidence for each [dispute\nreason](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/categories).\n\nYou can also programmatically manage disputes using the API. With the API, you\ncan upload evidence, respond to disputes, and receive dispute events using\nwebhooks.\n\n## Retrieve a dispute\n\nFor details about a dispute,\n[retrieve](https://docs.stripe.com/api#retrieve_dispute) a `Dispute` object:\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/disputes/{{DISPUTE_ID}} \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\"\n```\n\nThe response contains information about the dispute and any response or evidence\nthat’s already been provided.\n\n```\n{\n object: \"dispute\"\n id: \"{{DISPUTE_ID}}\",\n charge: \"ch_5Q4BjL06oPWwho\",\n evidence: {\n customer_name: \"Jane Austen\",\n customer_purchase_ip: \"127.0.0.1\",\n product_description: \"Widget ABC, color: red\",\n shipping_tracking_number: \"Z01234567890\",\n uncategorized_text: \"Additional notes and comments\",\n },\n evidence_details: {\n due_by: 1403047735,\n submission_count: 1\n }\n ...\n}\n```\n\n## Update a dispute\n\nYou [update](https://docs.stripe.com/api#update_dispute) the `Dispute` object\nand pass structured evidence with the `evidence` parameter.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/disputes/{{DISPUTE_ID}} \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n --data-urlencode \"evidence[customer_email_address]\"=\"email@example.com\" \\\n -d \"evidence[shipping_date]\"=2024-02-01 \\\n -d \"evidence[shipping_documentation]\"={{FILE_ID}}\n```\n\nTo view all available fields for the evidence parameter, see [Dispute\nevidence](https://docs.stripe.com/api#dispute_evidence_object). There are two\ntypes of evidence you can provide, depending on the field being updated:\n\n- Text-based evidence, such as `customer_email` and `service_date`. These types\nof evidence take a string of text.\n- File-based evidence, such as `service_documentation` and\n`customer_communication`. These take a\n[file_upload](https://docs.stripe.com/api#file_object) object ID.\n\n#### Note\n\nThe combined character count for all text-based evidence field submissions is\nlimited to 150,000.\n\nYou can provide documents or images (for example, a contract or screenshot) as\npart of dispute evidence using the [File Upload\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/file-upload). You first upload a document with the\npurpose of `dispute_evidence`, which generates a `File_upload` object that you\ncan use when submitting evidence. Make sure the file meets [Stripe’s\nrecommendations](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/best-practices#file-upload-recommendations)\nbefore uploading it for evidence submission.\n\nIf you’re only interested in submitting a single file or a large amount of\nplaintext as evidence, use `uncategorized_text` or `uncategorized_file`.\nHowever, fill in as many fields as possible so you have the best chance at\noverturning a dispute.\n\n## Multiple disputes on a single payment\n\nIt’s not typical, but it’s possible for a customer to dispute the same payment\nmore than once. For example, a customer might partially dispute a payment for\none of the items in an order if it was damaged in delivery, and then file a\nsecond dispute against a different item in the same order because the item\ndidn’t work properly.\n\nStripe distinguishes all disputes by a unique identifier, regardless of whether\nthey’re related to a single payment. When you [list\ndisputes](https://docs.stripe.com/api#list_disputes), you can filter the results\nto show only disputes for a particular payment by specifying the `id` of the\n`PaymentIntent` or `Charge` object and including the [payment_intent\nfilter](https://docs.stripe.com/api/disputes/list#list_disputes-charge) or\n[charge\nfilter](https://docs.stripe.com/api/disputes/list#list_disputes-payment_intent).\n\nBy PaymentIntentBy Charge\n```\ncurl -G https://api.stripe.com/v1/disputes \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d payment_intent={{PAYMENT_INTENT_ID}}\n```\n\nWhen a payment has multiple disputes, use the `id` provided for each returned\ndispute in the list to make sure you’re responding to the correct dispute by\nspecifying its `id` when you\n[retrieve](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/api#retrieve-a-dispute) or [update\nthe dispute](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/api#update-a-dispute).\n\n## See also\n\n- [Dispute categories](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/categories)\n- [Measuring disputes](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/measuring)\n- [Preventing disputes and fraud](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention)\n\n## Links\n\n- [dispute reason](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/categories)\n- [retrieve](https://docs.stripe.com/api#retrieve_dispute)\n- [update](https://docs.stripe.com/api#update_dispute)\n- [Dispute evidence](https://docs.stripe.com/api#dispute_evidence_object)\n- [file_upload](https://docs.stripe.com/api#file_object)\n- [File Upload API](https://docs.stripe.com/file-upload)\n- [Stripe’s\nrecommendations](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/best-practices#file-upload-recommendations)\n- [list disputes](https://docs.stripe.com/api#list_disputes)\n- [payment_intent\nfilter](https://docs.stripe.com/api/disputes/list#list_disputes-charge)\n- [charge\nfilter](https://docs.stripe.com/api/disputes/list#list_disputes-payment_intent)\n- [Measuring disputes](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/measuring)\n- [Preventing disputes and fraud](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention)",
