You can either manually close the books with all checks and adjustments\nfinished each month, or you can let Stripe automate closing the books.\n\nYou can also reopen past accounting periods using accounting period control.\nThis is useful when you first start using Revenue Recognition because it allows\nyou to make adjustments to past data without creating corrections in the current\nperiod. For example, when you apply\n[rules](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/rules) to fit Revenue\nRecognition with your own business model, it’s likely to change the history of\nclosed accounting periods. You can decide on whether to reopen the closed\naccounting periods or make adjustments in the current accounting period.\n\n## Setting accounting periods\n\nYou can find the accounting periods section on [the Revenue Recognition controls\npage](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/revenue-recognition).\n\n![Accounting periods\ncontrols](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/accounting_period_controls.64932706c8bd298d267ed8aa9148214f.png)\n\n[Select the mode for accounting\nperiods](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/revenue-settings/accounting-period-control#accounting-period-mode)\nTo get started, select the `mode` for your accounting periods. The default is\n`automatic`.\n\nModeDescriptionsAutomaticAccounting periods automatically close at the end of\neach month.ManualYou control when to close the accounting periods.[Choose the\nlatest closed accounting period in manual\nmode](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/revenue-settings/accounting-period-control#latest-closed-accounting-period)\nWhen you set `latest closed accounting period`, you close the selected\naccounting period along with all previous accounting periods, and you open all\nfollowing periods. You can choose one of the periods in the past 24 months, and\nyou can also choose `no closed accounting periods`. For example, when you choose\nthe `latest closed accounting period` to be February 2021 in `manual` mode, the\naccounting periods looks like the following example:\n\nBefore Jan 2021Jan 2021Feb 2021Mar 2021Apr 2021May 2021Jun\n2021ClosedClosedClosedOpenOpenOpenOpen\n## How accounting period control works\n\n**Controlling closing process for your accounting period cycle**\n\nAccounting period control allows you to configure the closing process with your\nown workflow for the accounting period cycle. You can choose the `manual` mode,\nand check all terms and fix the human errors before closing the accounting\nperiods manually, or you can automate closing your Revenue Recognition book\nusing the `automatic` mode.\n\n**Getting started with Revenue Recognition**\n\nIf you’re new to Revenue Recognition, use accounting period control to get\nstarted. For example, when you apply\n[rules](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/rules) to fit Revenue\nRecognition with your own business model, you can set `manual` mode with `no\nclosed accounting periods`. In this way, all the changes go into the original\naccounting periods, which can help you understand your books.\n\nYou can open accounting periods after setting [revenue recognition\nrules](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/rules), unless you need to\nissue corrections. In that case, you must close the accounting period before\nsetting any rules.\n\nAdjustments for accounting periods take up to 24 hours to complete. When\ncompleted, you can see the setting in monthly summary charts and CSV-only\nreports in the Dashboard. For example, when you choose the `latest closed\naccounting period` to be February 2021 in `manual` mode, the charts and reports\nlook like the following example:\n\n![Revenue chart with manual mode and latest closed accounting period as February\n2021](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/accounting-period-control-revenue-chart.d6ab06169fb7d15f27f2e7cfe5a2282e.png)\n\n![Income statement report with manual mode and latest closed accounting period\nas February\n2021](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/accounting-period-control-income-statement-report.da2f6a5fb6491e4e4da58c115c7089f7.png)\n\n## Links\n\n- [rules](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/rules)\n- [the Revenue Recognition controls\npage](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/revenue-recognition)",
