This action creates a Stripe `Customer` object.\n- Stripe creates an invoice at the beginning of each billing period, which\nprompts the connector to create an invoice in NetSuite. The connector also\ncreates a new customer or links to an existing NetSuite customer.\n- If you enabled NetSuite revenue recognition, the connector splits revenue over\nthe correct period on the line item level.\n- When a customer successfully pays the Stripe invoice, the connector creates a\nNetSuite `Customer Payment` and applies it to the corresponding invoice in\nNetSuite. If payment fails, resulting in a canceled subscription, the connector\ncan automatically close the NetSuite invoice with a credit memo, or whatever\naction you configure for failed payments.\n- The connector automatically syncs refunds and disputes from Stripe to\nNetSuite, and creates credit memos and customer refunds.\n- The connector [automatically\nreconciles](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/netsuite/deposit-automation)\nStripe payments against a bank deposit in NetSuite. This includes calculating\nand recording any processing fees or currency conversion fees.\n\n## Customer flow\n\nCustomer\n\nStripe\n\nConnector\n\nNetSuite\n\nTo initiate the [customer\nflow](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/netsuite/stripe-customers-netsuite), a\ncustomer submits payment on your website\n\nStripe creates a Customer object to store payment details\n\nThe connector creates a NetSuite customer when creating an invoice\n\nA diagram providing a high level overview of the customer flow for billing and\ninvoice automation outlined in this doc\n## Invoice flow\n\nBusiness\n\nStripe\n\nConnector\n\nNetSuite\n\nYou initiate the Stripe [invoice\nflow](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/netsuite/stripe-invoices-netsuite)\nthrough the backend or Dashboard\n\nStripe finalizes the invoice\n\nThe connector creates a NetSuite invoice\n\nA diagram providing a high level overview of the invoice flow for billing and\ninvoice automation outlined in this doc\n## Payment flow\n\nCustomer\n\nStripe\n\nConnector\n\nNetSuite\n\nCash reconciliation\n\nTo initiate the [payment\nflow](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/netsuite/stripe-charges-netsuite#charges-for-invoices),\na customer pays an invoice\n\nStripe applies the charge to the invoice\n\nThe connector creates and posts the customer payment to the Undeposited Funds\naccount, and applies it to the invoice\n\nThe connector moves the settled deposit from the bank to a general ledger\naccount\n\nA diagram providing a high level overview of the payment flow for billing and\ninvoice automation outlined in this doc\n## Refund or chargeback flow\n\nCustomer\n\nStripe\n\nConnector\n\nNetSuite\n\nCash reconciliation\n\nTo initiate the\n[refund](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/netsuite/stripe-refunds-netsuite) or\n[chargeback](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/netsuite/stripe-disputes-netsuite)\nflow, a customer requests a refund or disputes a charge\n\nStripe issues a refund or chargeback\n\nThe connector creates a credit memo and customer refund, and posts it to the\nUndeposited Funds account for a full or partial refund\n\nThe connector moves the settled deposit from the bank to a general ledger\naccount\n\nA diagram providing a high level overview of the refund or chargeback flow for\nbilling and invoice automation outlined in this doc\n## See also\n\n- [Deposit\nautomation](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/netsuite/deposit-automation)\n- [Stripe invoices in\nNetSuite](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/netsuite/stripe-invoices-netsuite)\n- [Stripe prices and coupons in\nNetSuite](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/netsuite/stripe-prices-coupons-netsuite)\n- [Revenue\nrecognition](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/netsuite/revenue-recognition)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Stripe App\nMarketplace](https://marketplace.stripe.com/apps/netsuite-connector)\n- [subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview)\n- [Stripe Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/overview)\n- [credit notes](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/dashboard/credit-notes)\n- [discounts](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/coupons)\n- [uncollectible\ninvoices](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/examples/contra#uncollectible)\n- [taxes](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/taxes/collect-taxes)\n- [prorations](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/prorations)\n- [Stripe Billing](https://docs.stripe.com/billing)\n- [automatically\nreconciles](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/netsuite/deposit-automation)\n- [customer\nflow](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/netsuite/stripe-customers-netsuite)\n- [invoice\nflow](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/netsuite/stripe-invoices-netsuite)\n- [payment\nflow](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/netsuite/stripe-charges-netsuite#charges-for-invoices)\n- [refund](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/netsuite/stripe-refunds-netsuite)\n-\n[chargeback](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/netsuite/stripe-disputes-netsuite)\n- [Stripe prices and coupons in\nNetSuite](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/netsuite/stripe-prices-coupons-netsuite)\n- [Revenue\nrecognition](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/netsuite/revenue-recognition)",
