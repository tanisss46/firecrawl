We\nrecommend that you configure your payment methods from the Stripe Dashboard\nusing the instructions in [Accept a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web&ui=stripe-hosted).\n\nIf you want to continue manually configuring the payment methods you present to\nyour customers with Checkout, use this guide. Otherwise, update your integration\nto [configure payment methods in the\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/dashboard-payment-methods).\n\nThis guides you through enabling Cash App Pay on\n[Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout), our hosted checkout form,\nand shows the differences between accepting a card payment and a Cash App Pay\npayment.\n\n[Determine\ncompatibility](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/cash-app-pay/accept-a-payment#compatibility)\nA Checkout Session must satisfy all of the following conditions to support Cash\nApp Pay payments:\n\n- [Prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices) for all line items must be\nexpressed in USD.\n[Set up\nStripeServer-side](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/cash-app-pay/accept-a-payment#web-set-up-stripe)\nFirst, you need a Stripe account. [Register\nnow](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register).\n\nUse our official libraries for access to the Stripe API from your application:\n\n```\n# Available as a gem\nsudo gem install stripe\n```\n\n```\n# If you use bundler, you can add this line to your Gemfile\ngem 'stripe'\n```\n\n[Accept a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/cash-app-pay/accept-a-payment#accept-a-payment)\n#### Note\n\nThis guide builds on the foundational [accept a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?integration=checkout)\nCheckout integration.\n\n### Enable Cash App Pay as a payment method\n\nWhen creating a new [Checkout\nSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions), you need to:\n\n- Add `cashapp` to the list of `payment_method_types`\n- Make sure all your `line_items` use the `usd` currency\n\n```\nStripe::Checkout::Session.create({\n mode: 'payment',\n payment_method_types: ['card'],\n payment_method_types: ['card', 'cashapp'],\n line_items: [{\n price_data: {\n currency: 'usd',\n product_data: {\n name: 'T-shirt',\n },\n unit_amount: 2000,\n },\n quantity: 1,\n }],\n success_url: 'https://example.com/success',\n cancel_url: 'https://example.com/cancel',\n})\n```\n\n### Fulfill your orders\n\nAfter accepting a payment, learn how to [fulfill\norders](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/fulfillment).\n\n[Test your\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/cash-app-pay/accept-a-payment#web-test-integration)Mobile\nweb app testingDesktop web app testing\nTo test your integration, choose Cash App Pay as the payment method and tap\n**Pay**. While testing, this redirects you to a test payment page where you can\napprove or decline the payment.\n\nIn live mode, tapping **Pay** redirects you to the Cash App mobile\napplication—you don’t have the option to approve or decline the payment within\nCash App. The payment is automatically approved after the redirect.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Checkout fulfillment](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/fulfillment)\n- [Customizing\nCheckout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/customization)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Accept a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web&ui=stripe-hosted)\n- [configure payment methods in the\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/dashboard-payment-methods)\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout)\n- [Prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices)\n- [Register now](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register)\n- [accept a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?integration=checkout)\n- [Checkout Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions)\n- [https://example.com/success](https://example.com/success)\n- [https://example.com/cancel](https://example.com/cancel)\n- [fulfill orders](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/fulfillment)\n- [Customizing\nCheckout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/customization)",
