Avoid any links that might take users\naway from the onboarding flow. For example:\n\n!\n\n!\n\n- Provide users the option to sign into an existing account or sign up for a new\naccount.\n- Use call-to-action labels that are consistent with your own onboarding flow\noutside of Stripe. For example:\n\n!\n\n## Example\n\nTo add the component to your app:\n\n```\nimport {SignInView} from '@stripe/ui-extension-sdk/ui';\n```\n\nThe following sample shows a `SignInView` component:\n\n```\n<SignInView\n description=\"Connect your SuperTodo account with Stripe.\"\n primaryAction={{label: 'Sign in', href: 'https://example.com'}}\n footerContent={\n <>\n Don't have an account? <Link href=\"https://example.com\">Sign up</Link>\n </>\n }\n brandColor=\"#635bff\"\n brandIcon={appIcon}\n/>\n```\n\n## Links\n\n- [Create an app](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/create-app)",
