France is part of the EU and applies the EU VAT rules. Read more about those
rules on the [European Union

## Register to collect tax

Different registration schemes could apply to your business, depending on
whether you’re based inside or outside the EU. After you’ve decided which
registration scheme is correct for your business, learn how to register in
France.

## How we calculate taxes

France applies the EU VAT rules. Learn more about [tax calculation in the
European Union](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries/european-union).

In France, there are some territories outside of the scope of the standard tax
system and might have different rules that apply. Stripe won’t calculate tax for
customers based there, even if you’ve added a registration for France. Learn
more about how Stripe handles [excluded
territories](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/zero-tax?#excluded-territories). This
applies to the following locations:

- Saint Barthélemy
- Saint Martin
- Saint Pierre and Miquelon
- Wallis and Futuna

## Report and file your taxes

Stripe Tax has filing partners—Taxually, Marosa, and Hands-off Sales Tax
(HOST)—to help automate your tax filing. These partners automatically sync your
tax transaction data in real time, eliminating the need for manual data entry or
file transfers. Learn more about [tax
filing](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/filing).

Stripe also provides reports of your completed tax transactions. Go to
[Registrations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations) to access these
reports. Learn more about [the different types of
reports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports).
