# Subscription pricing plans

## A new way to pay for Stripe Billing and Stripe Tax.

Stripe customers can pay for Stripe
[Billing](https://stripe.com/billing/pricing) and
[Tax](https://stripe.com/tax/pricing) with a subscription-based plan.
Subscription-based plans allow you to choose how you pay for these products: pay
as you go for more flexibility, or choose a subscription plan for more
predictable monthly costs. You can sign up for a subscription-based plan from
the [Your plans](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/plans) page in the Stripe
Dashboard.

## How Stripe subscription plans work

Subscription-based plans provide more predictable monthly costs as well as
potential discounts versus pay-as-you-go plans. To sign up for a subscription
plan:

- Select the monthly product usage entitlement that’s appropriate for your
business. Product usage entitlement is the Billing volume per month for Stripe
Billing, and transactions per month for Tax.
- Sign up for an annual contract that’s paid monthly.
- At the start of each subscription month, pay a subscription fee that covers
your selected product entitlement. If applicable, at the end of each month, pay
an overage fee for any product usage beyond your selected amount. Fees are
automatically deducted from your Stripe balance.
