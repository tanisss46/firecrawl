For more information, read our [support\npage](https://support.stripe.com/questions/sofort-is-being-deprecated-as-a-standalone-payment-method).\n\nSofort is a [single use](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#usage)\npayment method that requires customers to\n[authenticate](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#customer-actions)\neach payment. After your customer authenticates the payment, Stripe saves your\ncustomer’s\n[IBAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Bank_Account_Number) in a\n[SEPA Direct Debit](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sepa-debit) payment method.\nYou can then use the SEPA Direct Debit payment method to [accept future\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sepa-debit/accept-a-payment).\n\nWith this integration, Stripe charges the first Subscription payment through\nSofort to collect your customer’s bank details. If you’re offering a free trial,\nStripe charges your customer 1 EUR through Sofort to collect their bank details\nand immediately refunds it.\n\nA [Checkout Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions) represents\nthe details of your customer’s intent to purchase. You create a Checkout Session\nwhen your customer wants to start a\n[subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating). After\nredirecting your customer to a Checkout Session, Stripe presents a payment form\nwhere your customer can complete their purchase. After your customer completes a\npurchase, they’re redirected back to your site.\n\n[Set up\nStripeServer-side](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/sofort#web-setup)\nInstall the Stripe client of your choice:\n\n```\n# Available as a gem\nsudo gem install stripe\n```\n\n```\n# If you use bundler, you can add this line to your Gemfile\ngem 'stripe'\n```\n\nInstall the Stripe CLI (optional). The CLI provides [webhook\ntesting](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks#test-webhook), and you can run it to\ncreate your products and prices.\n\n```\n# Install Homebrew to run this command: https://brew.sh/\nbrew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe\n\n# Connect the CLI to your dashboard\nstripe login\n```\n\nFor additional install options, see [Get started with the Stripe\nCLI](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli).\n\n[Create the pricing modelDashboardStripe\nCLI](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/sofort#create-pricing-model)\nCreate your [products](https://docs.stripe.com/api/products) and their\n[prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices) in the Dashboard or with the Stripe\nCLI.\n\nThis example uses a fixed-price service with two different service-level\noptions: Basic and Premium. For each service-level option, you need to create a\nproduct and a recurring price. (If you want to add a one-time charge for\nsomething like a setup fee, create a third product with a one-time price. To\nkeep things simple, this example doesn’t include a one-time charge.)\n\nIn this example, each product bills at monthly intervals. The price for the\nBasic product is 5 EUR. The price for the Premium product is 15 EUR.\n\nDashboardStripe CLI\nGo to the [Add a product](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products/create)\npage and create two products. Add one price for each product, each with a\nmonthly recurring billing period:\n\n- Premium product: Premium service with extra features\n\n- Price: Standard pricing | 15 EUR\n- Basic product: Basic service with minimum features\n\n- Price: Standard pricing | 5 EUR\n\nAfter you create the prices, record the price IDs so you can use them in other\nsteps. Price IDs look like this: `price_G0FvDp6vZvdwRZ`.\n\nWhen you’re ready, use the ** to live mode** button at the top right of the\npage to clone your product from [test mode to live\nmode](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes).\n\nFor other pricing models, see [Billing\nexamples](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models).\n\n[Create a Checkout\nSessionClient-sideServer-side](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/sofort#create-checkout-session)\nAdd a checkout button to your website that calls a server-side endpoint to\ncreate a Checkout Session.\n\n```\n<html>\n <head>\n <title>Checkout</title>\n </head>\n <body>\n <form action=\"/create-checkout-session\" method=\"POST\">\n <button type=\"submit\">Checkout</button>\n </form>\n </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nCreate a Checkout Session with the ID of an existing\n[Price](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices). Make sure that the mode is set to\n`subscription` and that you pass at least one recurring price. You can add\none-time prices in addition to recurring prices. After creating the Checkout\nSession, redirect your customer to the\n[URL](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object#checkout_session_object-url)\nreturned in the response.\n\nWhen creating a Session, you can specify `payment_method_types` or have Stripe\nautomatically pick payment methods based on your\n[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) settings. If\nyou don’t specify `payment_method_types`, you must turn on Sofort recurring\npayments in the\n[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods). This enables\nSEPA Direct Debit for recurring Sofort payments only, but doesn’t turn on SEPA\nDirect Debit payments as a stand alone payment method.\n\nListing payment methods manuallyManage payment methods from the Dashboard\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/checkout/sessions \\\n -u sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2: \\\n -d \"payment_method_types[]\"=\"sofort\" \\\n -d \"line_items[][price]\"={{PRICE_ID}} \\\n -d \"line_items[][quantity]\"=1 \\\n -d \"mode\"=\"subscription\" \\\n-d \"success_url\"=\"https://example.com/success?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}\"\n\\\n -d \"cancel_url\"=\"https://example.com/cancel\" \\\n```\n\nWhen your customer successfully completes their payment, they’re redirected to\nthe `success_url`, a page on your website that informs the customer that their\npayment was successful. Make the Session ID available on your success page by\nincluding the `{CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}` template variable in the `success_url` as\nin the above example.\n\nWhen your customer clicks on your logo in a Checkout Session without completing\na payment, Checkout redirects them back to your website by navigating to the\n`cancel_url`. Typically, this is the page on your website that the customer\nviewed prior to redirecting to Checkout.\n\nCheckout Sessions expire 24 hours after creation by default.\n\n#### Caution\n\nDon’t rely on the redirect to the `success_url` alone for detecting payment\ninitiation, as:\n\n- Malicious users could directly access the `success_url` without paying and\ngain access to your goods or services.\n- Customers may not always reach the `success_url` after a successful\npayment—they might close their browser tab before the redirect occurs.\n[Confirm the payment is\nsuccessful](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/sofort#payment-success)\nWhen your customer completes a payment, Stripe redirects them to the URL that\nyou specified in the `success_url` parameter. Typically, this is a page on your\nwebsite that informs your customer that their payment is successful.\n\nSofort is a delayed notification payment method, which means that funds aren’t\nimmediately available. A Sofort payment takes up to 14 business days to make the\nfunds available. Because of this possibility, you might want to delay order\nfulfillment until the funds are available. After the payment succeeds, the\nunderlying [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents)\nstatus changes from `processing` to `succeeded`.\n\nStripe recommends fulfilling orders during the `processing` state. On average,\napproximately 0.2% of Sofort payments fail after entering the `processing`\nstate.\n\nThere are several ways you can confirm the payment is successful:\n\nDashboardWebhooksThird-party plugins\nSuccessful payments appear in the Dashboard’s [list of\npayments](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments). Click a payment to open the\npayment detail page. The **Checkout summary** section contains billing\ninformation and the list of items purchased, which you can use to manually\nfulfill the order.\n\n!\n\n#### Note\n\nStripe can help you keep up with incoming payments by sending you email\nnotifications whenever a customer successfully completes one. Use the Dashboard\nto [configure email notifications](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/user).\n\n[Test the\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/sofort#testing)\nUsing your [test API keys](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes), select\nSofort as the payment method and click the **Subscribe** button. After\nconfirming, you’re redirected to a test page with options to authorize or fail\nthe payment. Sofort payments remain pending for 3 minutes in a\n[sandbox](https://docs.stripe.com/sandboxes).\n\n- Click **Authorize test payment** to test the case when the setup is\nsuccessful.\n- Click **Fail test payment** to test the case when the customer fails to\nauthenticate.\n[OptionalCreate a trial for your\nsubscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/sofort#trials)\n## See also\n\n- [Customize your\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/customization)\n- [Manage subscriptions with the customer\nportal](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/build-subscriptions?ui=stripe-hosted)\n\n## Links\n\n- [support\npage](https://support.stripe.com/questions/sofort-is-being-deprecated-as-a-standalone-payment-method)\n- [single use](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#usage)\n-\n[authenticate](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#customer-actions)\n- [IBAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Bank_Account_Number)\n- [SEPA Direct Debit](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sepa-debit)\n- [accept future\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sepa-debit/accept-a-payment)\n- [sample on\nGitHub](https://github.com/stripe-samples/checkout-single-subscription)\n- [demo](https://checkout.stripe.dev/checkout)\n- [Checkout Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions)\n- [subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating)\n- [webhook testing](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks#test-webhook)\n- [https://brew.sh/](https://brew.sh/)\n- [Get started with the Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli)\n- [products](https://docs.stripe.com/api/products)\n- [prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices)\n- [Add a product](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products/create)\n- [test mode to live mode](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes)\n- [Billing examples](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models)\n- [Create a Checkout\nSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create)\n-\n[URL](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object#checkout_session_object-url)\n- [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods)\n-\n[https://example.com/success?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}](https://example.com/success?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID})\n- [https://example.com/cancel](https://example.com/cancel)\n- [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents)\n- [list of payments](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments)\n- [configure email notifications](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/user)\n- [sandbox](https://docs.stripe.com/sandboxes)\n- [Customize your\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/customization)\n- [Manage subscriptions with the customer\nportal](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/build-subscriptions?ui=stripe-hosted)",
