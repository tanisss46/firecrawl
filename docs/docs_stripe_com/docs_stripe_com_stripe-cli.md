# Get started with the Stripe CLI

## Build, test, and manage your Stripe integration directly from the command line.

The Stripe CLI is a developer tool to help you build, test, and manage your
integration with Stripe directly from the command line. It works on macOS,
Windows, and Linux, and offers a range of functionality to enhance your
developer experience with Stripe. You can use the Stripe CLI to:

- Create, retrieve, update, or delete any of your Stripe resources in a sandbox
(for example, create a product)
- Stream real-time API requests and events happening in your account
- Trigger events to test your webhooks integration

[View the full CLI reference](https://docs.stripe.com/cli).

- (Optional) If you donâ€™t want to use a browser, use the `--interactive` flag to
authenticate with an existing API secret key or restricted key. This is helpful
when authenticating to the CLI without a browser, such as in a CI/CD pipeline.

```
stripe login --interactive
```

- (Optional) Use the `--api-key` flag to specify your API secret key inline each
time you send a request.

```
stripe login --api-key sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2
```
