If the PaymentIntent has already\nbeen captured, you must\n[refund](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/refunds#refunds) the\nunderlying charge created by the PaymentIntent, using the [refunds\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_refund) or\n[Dashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/refunds?dashboard-or-api=dashboard).\n\nWe recommend [reconciling\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/collect-card-payment#reconciling)\non your backend after a day’s activity to prevent unintended authorizations and\nuncollected funds.\n\n## Availability\n\n**Canceling payments** is available on Visa, Mastercard, American Express,\nDiscover, and girocard. For single-message payment methods like\n[Interac](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/regional?integration-country=CA#interac-payments)\nand\n[eftpos](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/regional?integration-country=AU#eftpos-payments),\nPaymentIntents are automatically captured. In lieu of canceling PaymentIntents,\nmake sure your application can allow initiating a refund at the end of the\ncheckout flow.\n\n**Online refunds** are available on all card networks except for Interac.\n\n[In-person\nrefunds](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/regional?integration-country=CA#refund-an-interac-payment)\nare only available on Interac.\n\n## Cancel payments Client-sideServer-side\n\nYou can [cancel](https://docs.stripe.com/api#cancel_payment_intent) a\n`card_present` PaymentIntent at any time before it has been captured. Canceling\na PaymentIntent releases all uncaptured funds, and a canceled PaymentIntent can\nno longer be used to perform charges.\n\nUse this when, for example, your customer decides to use a different payment\nmethod or pay with cash after the payment has been processed. In your\napplication’s UI, consider allowing the user to cancel after they [confirm the\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/collect-card-payment#confirm-payment),\nand before you finalize it and notify your backend to\n[capture](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/collect-card-payment#capture-payment).\n\n#### Client-side\n\nCancel a `PaymentIntent` from your client using the iOS, Android, or React\nNative SDK:\n\nServer-drivenJavaScriptiOSAndroidReact Native\n#### Note\n\nClient-side `PaymentIntent` cancellation is possible with the iOS, Android, and\nReact Native SDKs. If you’re using a server-driven integration, cancel the\n`PaymentIntent` server-side.\n\n#### Server-side\n\nThe JavaScript SDK and server-driven integration require you to cancel the\n`PaymentIntent` on your server. For the other client SDKs, you can cancel the\n`PaymentIntent` on your server if the information required to start a payment\nisn’t readily available in your app.\n\n```\ncurl -X POST\nhttps://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents/pi_ANipwO3zNfjeWODtRPIg/cancel \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\"\n```\n\n## Perform refunds Server-side\n\nWhen you use a PaymentIntent to collect payment from a customer, Stripe creates\na [charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object) behind the scenes. To\nrefund the customer’s payment after the PaymentIntent has succeeded, [create a\nrefund](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_refund) by passing in the\nPaymentIntent ID or the charge ID. You can also optionally refund part of a\npayment by specifying an amount.\n\nYou can perform refunds [with the\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/refunds?dashboard-or-api=api) or [through the\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/refunds?dashboard-or-api=dashboard). For\nInterac transactions in Canada, the BBPOS WisePOS E reader and Stripe Reader\nS700 support [in-person\nrefunds](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/regional?integration-country=CA#refund-an-interac-payment)\ninstead.\n\nOnline refunds don’t require a cardholder to present their card again at the\npoint of sale. The following example shows how to create a full refund by\npassing in the PaymentIntent ID.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/refunds \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d payment_intent=pi_Aabcxyz01aDfoo\n```\n\nTo refund part of a PaymentIntent, provide an `amount` parameter, as an integer\nin cents (or the charge currency’s smallest currency unit):\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/refunds \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d payment_intent=pi_Aabcxyz01aDfoo \\\n -d amount=1000\n```\n\n## See also\n\n- [Cart display](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/display)\n- [Receipts](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/receipts)\n\n## Links\n\n-\n[captured](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/collect-card-payment#capture-payment)\n- [refunds API](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_refund)\n- [Dashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/refunds?dashboard-or-api=dashboard)\n- [reconciling\npayments](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/collect-card-payment#reconciling)\n-\n[Interac](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/regional?integration-country=CA#interac-payments)\n-\n[eftpos](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/regional?integration-country=AU#eftpos-payments)\n- [In-person\nrefunds](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/regional?integration-country=CA#refund-an-interac-payment)\n- [cancelPaymentIntent\n(iOS)](https://stripe.dev/stripe-terminal-ios/docs/Classes/SCPTerminal.html#/c:objc(cs)SCPTerminal(im)cancelPaymentIntent:completion:)\n- [cancelPaymentIntent\n(Android)](https://stripe.dev/stripe-terminal-android/core/com.stripe.stripeterminal/-terminal/cancel-payment-intent.html)\n- [cancelPaymentIntent (React\nNative)](https://stripe.dev/stripe-terminal-react-native/api-reference/interfaces/StripeTerminalSdkType.html#cancelPaymentIntent)\n- [cancelPaymentIntent\n(Java)](https://stripe.dev/stripe-terminal-java/core/com.stripe.stripeterminal/-terminal/cancel-payment-intent.html)\n- [cancel](https://docs.stripe.com/api#cancel_payment_intent)\n- [confirm the\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/collect-card-payment#confirm-payment)\n- [Cancel a PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/cancel)\n- [charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object)\n- [with the API](https://docs.stripe.com/refunds?dashboard-or-api=api)\n- [Cart display](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/display)\n- [Receipts](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/receipts)",
