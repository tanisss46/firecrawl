If you\nuse our front-end products, Stripe automatically determines the most relevant\npayment methods to display. Go to the [Stripe\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and enable\nTWINT. To get started with one of our hosted UIs, follow a quickstart:\n\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart): Our prebuilt, hosted\ncheckout page.\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart): Our drop-in UI\ncomponents.\n\n### Other payment products\n\nThe following Stripe products also let you add TWINT from the Dashboard:\n\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n\nIf you prefer to manually list payment methods, learn how to [manually configure\nTWINT as a payment\nmethod](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/twint/accept-a-payment).\n\n## Refunds\n\nYou can refund TWINT charges up to 180 days after the payment completes. Refunds\nusually take a few minutes to complete. TWINT supports full and partial refunds.\nYou can also issue multiple partial refunds up to the amount of the original\ncharge.\n\n## Disputes\n\nBuyers can dispute TWINT transactions by filing a complaint with their bank.\nTWINT disputes are rare, with 25-50 disputes recorded for every 1,000,000\ntransactions.\n\n## Connect\n\nYou can use [Stripe Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/how-connect-works)\nwith TWINT to process payments on behalf of a connected account. Connect users\ncan use TWINT with the following charge types:\n\n- [Direct](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges)\n- [Destination](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges)\n- [Separate charges and\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n### Enable TWINT for connected accounts that use the Stripe Dashboard\n\nConnected accounts that use the Stripe Dashboard can enable TWINT in their\n[Payment methods\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) in the\nDashboard. To check which accounts have enabled TWINT, use the `capabilities`\nhash in our [accounts webhooks or\nAPIs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-capabilities-twint_payments)\nto see if the `twint_payments` capability is set to `active`.\n\n### Enable TWINT for connected accounts that use the Express Dashboard or a dashboard that isn’t hosted by Stripe\n\nFollow the instructions to [enable payment methods for your connected\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities). The name of\nyour connected account is the name customers see during checkout and in the\nTWINT app.\n\n## Links\n\n- [single-use](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#usage)\n- [authenticate and\napprove](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#customer-actions)\n- [immediate\nnotification](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#payment-notification)\n- [Standard payout timing](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts#payout-speed)\n- [Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/twint#connect)\n- [Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/twint#disputed-payments)\n- [Yes / Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/twint#refunds)\n- [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods)\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart)\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart)\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n- [manually configure TWINT as a payment\nmethod](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/twint/accept-a-payment)\n- [Stripe Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/how-connect-works)\n- [Direct](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges)\n- [Destination](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges)\n- [Separate charges and\ntransfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n- [accounts webhooks or\nAPIs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-capabilities-twint_payments)\n- [enable payment methods for your connected\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities)",
