  "content": "# Using Connect with Standard connected accounts\n\n## Use Standard connected accounts to get started using Connect right away, and let Stripe handle the majority of the connected account experience.\n\nA *Standard* connected account is a conventional Stripe account where your\nconnected account has a relationship with Stripe, is able to log in to the\n[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/), and can process charges on their\nown.\n\nStripe’s sample integration,\n[Kavholm](https://github.com/stripe-samples/connect-onboarding-for-standard),\nshows you how to use [Connect Onboarding](https://stripe.com/connect/onboarding)\nfor a seamless user onboarding experience.\n\n![Screenshot of Connect Onboarding\nform](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/Kavholm-Seamless-Standard.78b64d90c0bf87130c8b6ba1ef53df7f.png)\n\n## Get started\n\nIf you’re new to [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect), start with a guide\nto use Standard accounts to [enable other businesses to accept payments\ndirectly](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/enable-payment-acceptance-guide).\n\n## How to use Connect Onboarding for Standard accounts\n\n- Go to your [Connect settings\npage](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/applications/settings) to customize\nthe visual appearance of the form with the name, color, and icon of your brand.\nConnect Onboarding requires this information.\n- Use the `/v1/accounts` API to\n[create](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/create) a new account and get the\naccount ID. You can prefill information on the account object for the user\nbefore you generate the account link. You must pass the following parameter:\n\n- `type` = `standard`\n\n#### Note\n\nAfter you’ve created the new account, check to see that the account displays in\nthe Dashboard.\n- Call the [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links) API to\ncreate a link for the account to onboard with.\n- In the onboarding flow for your own platform, redirect your user to the `url`\nreturned by [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links).\n- Handle additional account states, redirecting your account to the Connect\nOnboarding flow if necessary.\n- *Optional*: You can add additional procedures, such as Tax or Climate, to the\nConnect Onboarding flow through the [Connect onboarding\noptions](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/onboarding-options) in\nthe Dashboard.\n[Create a Standard account and prefill\ninformation](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/standard-accounts#create-account)\nUse the [Create Account](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/create) API to\ncreate a connected account with `type` set to `standard`. You can prefill any\ninformation, but at a minimum, you must specify the `type`. The country of the\naccount defaults to the same country as your platform, and the account confirms\nthe selection during onboarding. If you know what\n[capabilities](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities) the account\nneeds, you can request them when you create it.\n\n#### Note\n\nThis example includes only some of the fields you can set when creating an\naccount. For a full list of the fields you can set, such as `address` and\n`website_url`, see the [Create Account API\nreference](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/create).\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d type=standard\n```\n\nIf you’ve already collected information for your connected accounts, you can\nprefill that information on the `Account` object. You can prefill any account\ninformation, including personal and business information, external account\ninformation, and so on.\n\nConnect Onboarding doesn’t ask for the prefilled information. However, it does\nask the account holder to confirm the prefilled information before accepting the\n[Connect service\nagreement](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/service-agreement-types).\n\nWhen testing your integration, prefill account information using [test\ndata](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/testing).\n\n[Create an account\nlink](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/standard-accounts#create-link)\nYou can create an account link by calling the [Account\nLinks](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links) API with the following\nparameters:\n\n- `account` - use the account ID returned by the API from the previous step\n- `refresh_url`\n- `return_url`\n- `type` = `account_onboarding`\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/account_links \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d account={{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}} \\\n --data-urlencode refresh_url=\"https://example.com/reauth\" \\\n --data-urlencode return_url=\"https://example.com/return\" \\\n -d type=account_onboarding\n```\n\n[Redirect your user to the account link\nURL](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/standard-accounts#redirect-link)\nThe response to your [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links)\nrequest includes a value for the key `url`. Redirect to this link to send your\nuser into the flow. You can only use URLs from the [account\nlinks](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links) once because they grant access\nto the account holder’s personal information. Authenticate the user in your\napplication before redirecting them to this URL. After you create an account\nlink on a Standard account, you won’t be able to read or write [Know Your\nCustomer](https://support.stripe.com/questions/know-your-customer) (KYC)\ninformation. Prefill any KYC information before creating the first account link.\n\n#### Security tip\n\nDon’t email, text, or otherwise send account link URLs outside of your platform\napplication. Instead, provide them to the authenticated account holder within\nyour application.\n\n[Handle the user returning to your\nplatform](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/standard-accounts#return-user)\nConnect Onboarding requires you to pass both a `return_url` and `refresh_url` to\nhandle all cases where you redirect the user to your platform. It’s important\nthat you implement these correctly to provide the best experience for your user.\n\n#### Note\n\nYou can use HTTP for your `return_url` and `refresh_url` while in test mode (for\nexample, to test with localhost), but you can only use HTTPS in live mode. Be\nsure to swap testing URLs for HTTPS URLs before going live.\n\n#### return_url\n\nStripe issues a redirect to this URL when the user completes the Connect\nOnboarding flow. This doesn’t mean that all information has been collected or\nthat there are no outstanding requirements on the account. This only means the\nflow was entered and exited properly.\n\nNo state is passed through this URL. After redirecting a user to your\n`return_url`, check the state of the `details_submitted` parameter on their\naccount by doing either of the following:\n\n- Listening to `account.updated` [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks)\n- Calling the [Accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts) API and\ninspecting the returned object\n\n#### refresh_url\n\nYour user redirects to the `refresh_url` in these cases:\n\n- The link expired (a few minutes went by since the link was created)\n- The user already visited the link (they refreshed the page, or clicked back or\nforward in the browser)\n- Your platform is no longer able to access the account\n- The account has been rejected\n\nYour `refresh_url` triggers a method on your server to call [Account\nLinks](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links) again with the same\nparameters, and redirect the user to the Connect Onboarding flow to create a\nseamless experience.\n\n[Handle users that have not completed\nonboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/standard-accounts#handle-users)\nA user that is redirected to your `return_url` might not have completed the\nonboarding process. Use the `/v1/accounts` endpoint to retrieve the user’s\naccount and check for `charges_enabled`. If the account isn’t fully onboarded,\nprovide UI prompts to allow the user to continue onboarding later. The user can\ncomplete their account activation through a new account link (generated by your\nintegration). You can check the state of the `details_submitted` parameter on\ntheir account to see if they’ve completed the onboarding process.\n\n[OptionalEnable Stripe Tax obligation\nmonitoring](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/standard-accounts#enable-stripe-tax)\n## See also\n\n- [Creating charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges)\n- [Authentication](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/authentication)\n- [OAuth reference](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/oauth-reference)\n\n## Links\n\n- [OAuth](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/oauth-reference)\n- [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/)\n- [Kavholm](https://github.com/stripe-samples/connect-onboarding-for-standard)\n- [Connect Onboarding](https://stripe.com/connect/onboarding)\n- [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)\n- [enable other businesses to accept payments\ndirectly](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/enable-payment-acceptance-guide)\n- [Connect settings\npage](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/applications/settings)\n- [create](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/create)\n- [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links)\n- [Connect onboarding\noptions](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/onboarding-options)\n- [capabilities](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities)\n- [Connect service\nagreement](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/service-agreement-types)\n- [test data](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/testing)\n- [https://example.com/reauth](https://example.com/reauth)\n- [https://example.com/return](https://example.com/return)\n- [Know Your Customer](https://support.stripe.com/questions/know-your-customer)\n- [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks)\n- [Accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts)\n- [Creating charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges)\n- [Authentication](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/authentication)",
