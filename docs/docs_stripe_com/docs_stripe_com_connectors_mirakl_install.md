# Mirakl Connector installation

## Install and validate the Miraki connector for Stripe.

## Requirements

Installing and running the application requires the following:

- PHP 7.3+
- PostgreSQL
- A web server, Nginx recommended
- A valid SSL/[TLS](https://docs.stripe.com/security/guide#tls) certificate
- Supervisord or equivalent
- Crontab or equivalent

## Install using Docker

You can build and start the application by embedding it in a container. See our
[Docker
sample](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-mirakl-connector/tree/master/examples/docker)
for more information.

## Install manually

- Install [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/).
- Clone or download the [Mirakl
Connector](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-mirakl-connector.git) from GitHub.
- Move the content to your web server directory, for example, `/var/www`.
- Download dependencies:

```
composer install --prefer-dist --no-dev
```

- Make sure you properly configured the [.env
file](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/mirakl/configuration).
- Run the migrations to set up the database:

```
bin/console doctrine:migration:migrate --no-interaction
```

If you encounter any errors at this stage, check the `DATABASE_URL` variable in
your .env file.

- Update your supervisor to automatically start and restart the workers.

A [configuration
example](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-mirakl-connector/blob/master/examples/docker/app/config/supervisord.conf)
is available in our Docker sample. You can skip this step in a development
environment and start the workers manually when needed, for example:

```
php bin/console messenger:consume process_transfers --time-limit=3600 --env=prod
```

- Update your job scheduler to run the commands periodically.

A [configuration
example](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-mirakl-connector/blob/master/examples/docker/app/config/crontab)
is available in our Docker sample. You can skip this step in a development
environment and start the jobs manually when needed, for example:

```
php bin/console connector:dispatch:process-transfer -q 2>&1
```

- Make sure that your web server is configured to use the `public` directory as
document root.

## Check your installation

Open your terminal and run the following command to confirm that your
application is up and running correctly:

```
curl -X GET "https://connector-url/api/mappings" \
 -H "accept: application/json" \
 -H "X-AUTH-TOKEN: $OPERATOR_PASSWORD"
```

You should get a `200` response code along with an empty payload.

## Security

On your server, *restrict all inbound traffic* to the connector except for the
following endpoints:

- **/api/public/onboarding/refresh**

Stripe redirects the seller to this URL to get a new onboarding link if it
expires.
- **/api/public/webhook/operator**

Stripe notifies this endpoint when a payment is updated to map it with a Mirakl
order within the connector.
- **/api/public/webhook/sellers**

Stripe notifies this endpoint when a Stripe account is updated to synchronize
the sellerâ€™s status within the connector.

These endpoints are safe to expose, they each have an internal protection
mechanism. Other endpoints are not safe to expose unless protected by a strong
`OPERATOR_PASSWORD`.
