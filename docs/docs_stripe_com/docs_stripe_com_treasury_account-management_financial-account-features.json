  "content": "# Financial account features\n\n## Learn about the features available for financial accounts.\n\nYou add features to [financial\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/account-management/financial-accounts)\nto provide the functionality that enables you to move money between accounts,\nattach payment cards, and more. You typically assign the `Feature` objects you\nwant when creating `FinancialAccount` objects, but you can add or remove them at\nany time. Some `Features` require that the connected account associated with the\nfinancial account have particular capabilities active. For example, a connected\naccount must have the `card_issuing` capability active before you can request\nthe `card_issuing` feature on the financial account attached to that connected\naccount.\n\n## Available features\n\nThe following table lists the available `Features` for a `FinancialAccount` and\nthe capabilities the associated connected account must have active to add them.\n\n#### Note\n\nYou must request or have the following capabilities active before you can\nrequest the `treasury` capability for connected accounts:\n\n- `transfers`\n- `card_payments`\nFeatureDescriptionRequired capabilities`card_issuing`Allows the creation of a\n[Card object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/#issuing_card_object) associated with\nthis financial account.`card_issuing``deposit_insurance`Requests FDIC insurance\neligibility for the financial\naccount.`treasury``financial_addresses.aba`Triggers the creation of a\n`FinancialAddress` object of type ABA associated with this financial account.\nWhen this feature is active, the address can receive money over ACH or wire, and\nexternal bank accounts can debit it.`treasury``inbound_transfers.ach`Allows\ncreation of `InboundTransfer` objects to fund the financial account by debiting\nan external US bank account.`treasury`,\n`us_bank_account_ach_payments``intra_stripe_flows`Enables this financial account\nto send money to or receive money from other financial accounts over the\n`stripe` network. Both financial accounts (originator and recipient) need this\nfeature enabled for `stripe` network outbound payments to\nwork.`treasury``outbound_payments.ach`Allows this financial account to send ACH\ntransfers using the `OutboundPayment` objects of the Stripe API.`treasury`,\n`us_bank_account_ach_payments``outbound_payments.us_domestic_wire`Allows this\nfinancial account to send US domestic wire transfers using `OutboundPayment`\nobjects of the Stripe API.`treasury``outbound_transfers.ach`Allows this\nfinancial account to send ACH transfers using `OutboundTransfer` objects of the\nStripe API.`treasury`,\n`us_bank_account_ach_payments``outbound_transfers.us_domestic_wire`Allows this\nfinancial account to send US domestic wire transfers using `OutboundTransfer`\nobjects of the Stripe API.`treasury`\n### Same-day ACH\n\n#### Private preview\n\nSame-day ACH is currently in preview with limited availability, subject to\nStripe review and approval. To request access, email\n[treasury-support@stripe.com](mailto:treasury-support@stripe.com).\n\nIf you don’t have access, API calls that include same-day ACH features or\nparameters return an error.\n\nThe following features enable financial accounts to use same-day ACH\nfunctionality. You must request the corresponding `*.ach` feature on a financial\naccount to use it. For example, to enable a financial account to send a same-day\n[OutboundPayment](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/financial-accounts/out-of/outbound-payments),\nyou must request `outbound_payments.ach` and `outbound_payments.ach.same_day` on\nthat financial account:\n\nFeatureDescriptionRequired capabilities`outbound_payments.ach.same_day`Allows\nthis financial account to send ACH transfers using `OutboundPayment` objects\nthat arrive in the destination account within the same business day.`treasury`,\n`us_bank_account_ach_payments``outbound_transfers.ach.same_day`Allows this\nfinancial account to send ACH transfers using `OutboundTransfer` objects that\narrive in the destination account within the same business day.`treasury`,\n`us_bank_account_ach_payments``inbound_payments.ach.same_day`Allows creation of\n`InboundTransfer` objects to fund the financial account within the same business\nday.`treasury`, `us_bank_account_ach_payments`\n## Requesting features\n\nTypically, you request features on your Treasury financial account when you\n[create the financial\naccount](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/account-management/financial-accounts#create-a-financialaccount).\nThe following request creates a financial account and requests features in the\nsame call.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/treasury/financial_accounts \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -H \"Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}\" \\\n -d \"supported_currencies[]\"=usd \\\n -d \"features[card_issuing][requested]\"=true \\\n -d \"features[financial_addresses][aba][requested]\"=true\n```\n\nIf you’re working with existing financial accounts, use `POST\n/v1/treasury/financial_accounts/{{FINANCIAL_ACCOUNT_ID}}/features` to request\nadditional features.\n\n```\ncurl\nhttps://api.stripe.com/v1/treasury/financial_accounts/{{FINANCIAL_ACCOUNT_ID}}/features\n\\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -H \"Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}\" \\\n -d \"card_issuing[requested]\"=true \\\n -d \"deposit_insurance[requested]\"=true \\\n -d \"financial_addresses[aba][requested]\"=true \\\n -d \"inbound_transfers[ach][requested]\"=true \\\n -d \"intra_stripe_flows[requested]\"=true \\\n -d \"outbound_payments[ach][requested]\"=true \\\n -d \"outbound_payments[us_domestic_wire][requested]\"=true \\\n -d \"outbound_transfers[ach][requested]\"=true \\\n -d \"outbound_transfers[us_domestic_wire][requested]\"=true\n```\n\n### Feature activation\n\nAfter you request a feature and satisfy all verification requirements to onboard\nthe connected account to your platform, the feature activates. For some\nfeatures, activation can be instantaneous (for example, `card_issuing`). Other\nfeatures, like `financial_addresses.aba`, [activate\nasynchronously](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/account-management/financial-account-features#webhooks).\nThe following API call creates a financial account and requests the\n‘financial_addresses.aba’ and ‘card_issuing’ features.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/treasury/financial_accounts \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -H \"Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}\" \\\n -d \"supported_currencies[]\"=usd \\\n -d \"features[financial_addresses][aba][requested]\"=true \\\n -d \"features[card_issuing][requested]\"=true\n```\n\nWhen you request features on financial account creation, the response indicates\ntheir status in the `active_features`, `pending_features`, and\n`restricted_features` properties. For more information, see the [Retrieving\nfeatures](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/account-management/financial-account-features#retrieving-features)\nsection.\n\n```\n{\n \"object\": \"treasury.financial_account\",\n \"created\": 1612927106,\n \"id\": \"fa_123\",\n \"country\": \"US\",\n \"supported_currencies\": [\"usd\"],\n \"active_features\": [\"card_issuing\"],\n \"pending_features\": [\"financial_addresses.aba\"],\n \"restricted_features\": [],\n// No FinancialAddress added as the financial_addresses.aba feature is not yet\nactive\n \"financial_addresses\": [],\n \"livemode\": true,\n \"status\": \"open\",\n ...\n}\n```\n\nYou can use `GET\n/v1/treasury/financial_accounts/{{FINANCIAL_ACCOUNT_ID}}/features` to retrieve\nthe features for the financial account created in the previous example.\n\n```\ncurl\nhttps://api.stripe.com/v1/treasury/financial_accounts/{{FINANCIAL_ACCOUNT_ID}}/features\n\\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -H \"Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}\"\n```\n\nThe response shows `financial_addresses.aba` with a `status` of `pending` and\n`status_details` with a `code` of `activating`.\n\n```\n{\n \"object\": \"treasury.financial_account_features\",\n \"financial_addresses\": {\n \"aba\": {\n \"requested\": true,\n \"status\": \"pending\",\n \"status_details\": [\n {\n \"code\": \"activating\"\n }\n ]\n }\n },\n \"card_issuing\": {\n \"requested\": true,\n \"status\": \"active\",\n \"status_details\": []\n },\n ...\n}\n```\n\nA feature can remain in this state for up to 30 minutes while Stripe\ncommunicates with external systems. When the `financial_addresses.aba` feature\nactivates, the financial account receives a `FinancialAddress` object and\ntriggers a `treasury.financial_account.features_status_updated`\n[webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks).\n\nThe following request retrieves the `FinancialAccount` details with the\n`financial_addresses.aba` details expanded.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/treasury/financial_accounts \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -H \"Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}\" \\\n -d \"expand[]\"=\"financial_addresses.aba.account_number\" \\\n -d \"supported_currencies[]\"=usd\n```\n\nThe response provides the account details, including the complete financial\naddress information.\n\n```\n{\n \"object\": \"treasury.financial_account\",\n \"id\": \"{{FINANCIAL_ACCOUNT_ID}}\",\n \"country\": \"US\",\n \"supported_currencies\": [\"usd\"],\n \"active_features\": [\"card_issuing\", \"financial_addresses.aba\"],\n \"pending_features\": [],\n \"restricted_features\": [],\n \"financial_addresses\": [\n {\n \"type\": \"aba\",\n \"supported_networks\": [\"ach\", \"domestic_wire_us\"],\n \"aba\": {\n \"account_number_last4\": \"7890\",\n \"account_number\": \"1234567890\",\n \"routing_number\": \"000000001\",\n \"bank_name\": \"Goldman Sachs\"\n }\n }\n ],\n \"livemode\": true,\n ...\n}\n```\n\nThe financial account can now receive credits or debits to this ABA financial\naddress.\n\n## Removing features\n\nTo remove a feature, use `POST\n/v1/treasury/financial_accounts/{{FINANCIALACCOUNT_ID}}/features` and set the\nvalue of the feature to `false`.\n\n```\ncurl\nhttps://api.stripe.com/v1/treasury/financial_accounts/{{FINANCIAL_ACCOUNT_ID}}/features\n\\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -H \"Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}\" \\\n -d \"card_issuing[requested]\"=false\n```\n\nIf successful, you receive the [Features\nobject](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/financial_account_features) as a\nresponse with the feature you removed absent from the object.\n\n## Retrieving features\n\nTo retrieve the features of a financial account, use `GET\n/v1/treasury/financial_accounts/{{FINANCIAL_ACCOUNT_ID}}/features`.\n\n```\ncurl\nhttps://api.stripe.com/v1/treasury/financial_accounts/{{FINANCIAL_ACCOUNT_ID}}/features\n\\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -H \"Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}\"\n```\n\nThe JSON response provides the feature details defined by three properties:\n\n- `requested`: Indicates whether the feature has been requested.\n- `status`: Describes the current state of the feature: `active`, `pending`, or\n`restricted`.\n- `status_details`: Array of hashes containing a code and resolution.\n\n```\n{\n \"card_issuing\": {\n \"requested\": true,\n \"status\": \"active\",\n \"status_details\": []\n },\n \"deposit_insurance\": {\n \"requested\": true,\n \"status\": \"restricted\",\n \"status_details\": [\n {\n \"code\": \"requirements_past_due\",\n \"resolution\": \"provide_information\"\n }\n ]\n }\n}\n```\n\nThe following table identifies the possible combinations of `status` and\n`status_details`.\n\nStatusStatus details codeStatus details\nresolutionDescription`pending``activating`Stripe is currently activating the\nfeature.`pending``requirements_pending_verification`The requirements for the\nassociated capability on the connected account have been submitted but haven’t\ncompleted\nverification.`restricted``requirements_past_due``provide_information`The\nconnected account has requirements that must be fulfilled before this feature\ncan be enabled.`restricted``rejected_unsupported_business``contact_stripe`The\naccount is rejected because this type of business isn’t currently supported. For\nmore information, email\n[treasury-support@stripe.com](mailto:treasury-support@stripe.com).`restricted``rejected_other``contact_stripe`The\naccount is rejected for other reasons. For more information, email\n[treasury-support@stripe.com](mailto:treasury-support@stripe.com).`restricted``restricted_by_platform``remove_restriction`The\nplatform has restricted this feature using the\n[platform_restrictions](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/financial_accounts/object#financial_account_object-platform_restrictions)\nhash.`restricted``financial_account_closed`This feature is unavailable because\nthe financial account is\nclosed.`restricted``restricted_other``contact_stripe`This feature is restricted\nfor other reasons. For more information, email\n[treasury-support@stripe.com](mailto:treasury-support@stripe.com).\n## Restricted features\n\nYou can restrict money movement in financial accounts on your platform to\ndisallow inbound flows (`inbound_flows`), outbound flows (`outbound_flows`), or\nboth types of flows. To do so, use the\n[platform_restrictions](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/financial_accounts/object#financial_account_object-platform_restrictions)\nhash. Restricting a flow impacts the financial account’s features that rely\ncompletely or partially on that flow. For example, to prevent money from moving\nout of a financial account, call `POST\n/v1/treasury/financial_accounts/{{FINANCIALACCOUNT_ID}}`.\n\n```\ncurl\nhttps://api.stripe.com/v1/treasury/financial_accounts/{{FINANCIAL_ACCOUNT_ID}} \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -H \"Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}\" \\\n -d \"platform_restrictions[outbound_flows]\"=restricted\n```\n\nIf successful, the response returns the financial account object with the\nappropriate flow set as `restricted`.\n\n```\n{\n \"object\": \"treasury.financial_account\",\n \"id\": \"{{FINANCIAL_ACCOUNT_ID}}\",\n \"status\": \"open\",\n ...\n \"platform_restrictions\": {\n \"inbound_flows\": \"unrestricted\",\n \"outbound_flows\": \"restricted\"\n },\n\"active_features\": [\"card_issuing\", \"deposit_insurance\",\n\"inbound_transfers.ach\"],\n \"pending_features\": [],\n\"restricted_features\": [\"financial_addresses.aba\", \"intra_stripe_flows\",\n\"outbound_payments.ach\", \"outbound_payments.us_domestic_wire\",\n\"outbound_transfers.ach\", \"outbound_transfers.us_domestic_wire\"]\n}\n```\n\nAs the previous response shows, restricting `outbound_flows` on the\nFinancialAccount adds `financial_addresses.aba`, `intra_stripe_flows`, and\n`inbound_transfers.ach` to the `restricted_features` array.\n\nFeatures in the `restricted_features` array can be fully or partially\nrestricted. For example, `financial_addresses.aba` is part of the\n`restricted_features` array in the preceding response because restricting\n`outbound_flows` prevents debits to the financial address. However, that\nfinancial address can still receive ACH or wire transfers, because\n`inbound_flows` aren’t restricted.\n\nSimilarly, the `intra_stripe_flows` feature is restricted because the\n`outbound_flows` restriction prevents using this financial account as the source\nof an outbound payment to another financial account. However, the financial\naccount can still be the destination of an outbound payment, so the feature\nisn’t completely restricted.\n\nThe following request retrieves feature details for a financial account with\nrestricted flows.\n\n```\ncurl\nhttps://api.stripe.com/v1/treasury/financial_accounts/{{FINANCIAL_ACCOUNT_ID}}/features\n\\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -H \"Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}\"\n```\n\nThe response provides the `Feature` object that includes `status_details` with a\ncode of `restricted_by_platform`. The `restriction` property provides a\nreference to the `platform_restriction` applied.\n\n```\n{\n \"object\": \"treasury.financial_account_features\",\n \"financial_addresses\": {\n \"aba\": {\n \"requested\": true,\n \"status\": \"restricted\",\n \"status_details\": [\n {\n \"code\": \"restricted_by_platform\",\n \"resolution\": \"remove_restriction\",\n \"restriction\": \"inbound_flows\"\n }\n ]\n }\n },\n ...\n}\n```\n\nThe following table outlines the impacts to features by `platform_restrictions`.\n\n#### Note\n\nRestricting inbound flows for the `financial_addresses.aba` feature doesn’t\nblock inbound wires.\n\n### Impact of platform restrictions on features\n\nThe following table shows the effects of `inbound_flows` and `outbound_flows`\nplatform restrictions on individual features:\n\nFeature\ninbound_flowsoutbound_flows`card_issuing`N/AN/A`deposit_insurance`N/AN/A`financial_addresses.aba`Prevents\nthe ABA financial address from receiving credits over ACH.Prevents debits from\nthe ABA financial address.`inbound_transfers.ach`Disables the\nfeature.N/A`intra_stripe_flows`Prevents the financial account from receiving\noutbound payments from other financial accounts.Outbound payments can’t be made\nfrom this financial account to other financial\naccounts.`outbound_payments.ach`N/ADisables the\nfeature.`outbound_payments.us_domestic_wire`N/ADisables the\nfeature.`outbound_transfers.ach`N/ADisables the\nfeature.`outbound_transfers.us_domestic_wire`N/ADisables the feature.\n## Webhooks\n\nTo perform an action with [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) when one\nor more features have transitioned to a certain status, compare your local state\nwith the latest state of the feature. While the `previous_attributes` property\nof the `treasury.financial_account.features_status_updated` webhook also\nindicates which features have changed from one status to another, events can be\nduplicated or received out of order. For more information, see the [webhooks\nbest practices](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks#best-practices).\n\n- `account.updated`- When requesting new features, the platform might get an\n`account.updated` webhook indicating that the `requirements` hash has changed\nwith fields added to `pending_verification`.\n- `treasury.financial_account.features_status_updated`- Indicates that one or\nmore features have changed status, reflected in changes to the\n`active_features`, `pending_features` or `restricted_features` arrays.\n\n## Links\n\n- [financial\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/account-management/financial-accounts)\n- [Card object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/#issuing_card_object)\n-\n[OutboundPayment](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/financial-accounts/out-of/outbound-payments)\n- [create the financial\naccount](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/account-management/financial-accounts#create-a-financialaccount)\n- [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks)\n- [Features\nobject](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/financial_account_features)\n-\n[platform_restrictions](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/financial_accounts/object#financial_account_object-platform_restrictions)\n- [webhooks best practices](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks#best-practices)",
