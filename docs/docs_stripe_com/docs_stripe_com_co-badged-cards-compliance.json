[Sign\nin](https://dashboard.stripe.com/login?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.stripe.com%2Fco-badged-cards-compliance)\nand return to this section to view if co-badged card regulation applies to you.\n\n**Applicable in:**\n\nAustriaBelgiumBulgariaCroatiaCyprusCzech\nRepublicDenmarkEstoniaFinlandFranceGermanyGreeceHungaryIcelandIrelandItalyLatviaLiechtensteinLithuaniaLuxembourgMaltaNetherlandsNorwayPolandPortugalRomaniaSlovakiaSloveniaSpainSweden\n## Regulatory requirements\n\n[Regulation (EU)\n2015/751](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32015R0751)\nrequires businesses in the European Economic Area (EEA) to honor customers’ card\nbrand choice for co-badged cards (for example, [Cartes\nBancaires](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/cartes-bancaires) cards co-badged\nwith Visa). In practice, this means you must enable cardholders to select a\npreferred card brand within your checkout form in accordance with these\nguidelines:\n\n- **Display the available card networks in your checkout form:** All available\ncard networks must be clearly identified during the checkout process. The visual\nquality, clarity, and size of the brand logos must be consistent, and it should\nbe clear to cardholders how to select a card network.\n- **Abide by the cardholder’s preferred card network:** Where the cardholder\nchooses their preferred card network, you must use it when confirming a payment\nor storing card details for future use. If the cardholder doesn’t make a choice,\nyou can choose your card network for the transaction.\n- **Allow updates to the preferred card network:** You must present cardholders\nupdating their payment methods that are saved for future use with the option to\nchange their preferred card network when they’re updating their payment details.\nFor example, you can provide a customer portal for managing saved payment\nmethods.\n\n## When regulation applies\n\nCartes Bancaires co-badged cards are the only Stripe-supported cards that fall\nunder this regulation. As a result, [Regulation (EU)\n2015/751](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32015R0751)\napplies to businesses that:\n\n- Are in the EEA\n- Can process Cartes Bancaires\n\n#### Connect users\n\nIn Connect integrations, the merchant of record on a transaction is the business\nwe use to determine if co-badged regulation applies. Depending on the Connect\nintegration, this can either be the Platform or the Connected account.\n\nBusinesses that meet the above criteria are required to present customers with a\nchoice of card network for all transactions that can processed with [Cartes\nBancaires](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/cartes-bancaires). A transaction is\neligible for Cartes Bancaires if:\n\n- The business can process Cartes Bancaires\n- The currency is EUR\n- The payment method is a co-badged Cartes Bancaires card\n\n#### Using test mode\n\nCartes Bancaires is always enabled in test mode. As a result, you might see the\nnetwork selector on Stripe-hosted UIs in test mode even if you don’t enable\nCartes Bancaires. This allows you to preview how Stripe-hosted UIs might handle\nco-badged cards if Cartes Bancaires was enabled.\n\n## Integration guides\n\nStripe-hosted UIs, such as\n[Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout), [Payment\nLinks](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links), and\n[Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements), will automatically\ndisplay a network selector when you meet the [applicability\ncriteria](https://docs.stripe.com/co-badged-cards-compliance#when-reglation-applies)\nabove, if configured according to the following guides. You can migrate to a\nStripe-hosted UI to use these features.\n\nFor other integrations, you’re fully responsible for making sure your\nintegration complies with the regulation requirements.\n\nCheckout and Payment LinksWeb ElementsMobile ElementsCustom integration\n[Stripe Checkout](https://stripe.com/checkout) supports customer card brand\nchoice by default. Customers who enter a co-badged card in Checkout can select\ntheir option for customer card brand choice:\n\n![The card input with a co-badged card in Stripe\nCheckout](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/checkout-card-brand-choice-full-page.9cf891dfb55abcdc9ae9046ea15bc054.png)\n\nCard input with a co-badged card\n\n## Identifying network used to process a charge\n\nThe charge object associated with a successful payment contains a `network`\nfield indicating which card network the payment was processed on:\n\n```\n{\n \"id\": \"ch_1Ff52K2eZvKYlo2CWe10i0s7\",\n \"object\": \"charge\",\n ...\n \"payment_method_details\": {\n \"card\": {\n \"brand\": \"visa\",\n ...\n \"network\": \"cartes_bancaires\",\n },\n \"type\": \"card\"\n }\n}\n```\n\n## Testing\n\nYou can use the following co-badged cards to test your integration:\n\nCard numbersTokensPaymentMethodsNumberBrandCVCDate4000002500001001Cartes\nBancaires or VisaAny 3 digitsAny future date5555552500001001Cartes Bancaires or\nMastercardAny 3 digitsAny future date\n\n## Links\n\n- [Regulation (EU)\n2015/751](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32015R0751)\n- [Sign\nin](https://dashboard.stripe.com/login?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.stripe.com%2Fco-badged-cards-compliance)\n- [Cartes Bancaires](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/cartes-bancaires)\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout)\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements)\n- [Stripe Checkout](https://stripe.com/checkout)",
