# Terminal network requirements

## Make sure your network is ready for Terminal, and troubleshoot common issues.

Terminal network requirements vary depending on the readers you use and the way
you build your integration. If your network doesn’t meet the requirements
outlined below, your Terminal integration won’t work as expected.

If you plan to use Terminal readers in remote locations with unfamiliar or
unknown network conditions, be prepared to handle unexpected network-related
issues. When using smart readers, we recommend a [server-driven
integration](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/setup-integration?terminal-sdk-platform=server-driven)
to minimize the number of potential network issues you might encounter.

## Mobile readers

[Mobile readers](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/mobile-readers) rely on your
point of sale device for internet connectivity and have the following network
requirements:

- Your point of sale device must be connected to the internet, and must be able
to connect to [Stripe’s infrastructure](https://docs.stripe.com/ips).
- The operating environment must be free of interference that prevents Bluetooth
devices from working normally (for example, excessive microwave oven use
produces interference on the 2.4GHz band, and can disrupt Bluetooth
connections).

The following mobile readers are available.

- [Stripe Reader M2](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/readers/stripe-m2)
- [BBPOS WisePad 3](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/readers/bbpos-wisepad3)

## Smart readers

[Smart readers](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/smart-readers) connect directly
to your network and use that connection to access the internet and Stripe. When
using one of our Terminal SDKs, your point of sale device and the smart reader
also communicate directly with each other over your local network.

The following smart readers are available.

- [Stripe Reader
S700](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/readers/stripe-reader-s700)
- [BBPOS WisePOS E](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/readers/bbpos-wisepos-e)

Smart readers have the following network requirements:

- Your network must support IPv4.- IPv6-only networks aren’t supported.
- Some readers can connect to IPv6 networks through DHCP, but must also be
assigned an IPv4 address. Changing advanced settings such as static IP, router,
subnet mask, and DNS are not supported with IPv6.
- Terminal readers must be assigned a [private IP
address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network).
- Both the Terminal reader and your point of sale device must be able to connect
to [Stripe’s infrastructure](https://docs.stripe.com/ips).
- If your Terminal readers support both WiFi and Ethernet, use one or the other,
not both—attempting to use WiFi and Ethernet at the same time results in an
unstable connection and intermittent downtime.- If you use WiFi, you can use a
dock without connecting an Ethernet cable (for example, for charging or
accessories only).
- WiFi networks must use WPA/WPA2/WPA3-Personal or WPA2/WPA3 EAP-PEAP Enterprise
encryption, and must be password protected.- Verifone P400 readers only support
WPA-Personal or WPA2-Personal encryption.
- Ethernet networks must support 10/100 Ethernet devices.
- If your network uses dynamic IP address assignment, your DHCP server
configuration needs to allow Terminal readers to retain the same IP address for
at least an entire workday.
- If your network limits the duration of network sessions (including idle
sessions), the minimum session length for Terminal readers must be at least an
entire workday.
- If you use one of our Terminal SDKs on a separate point of sale device (for
example, not an app running on the Terminal reader itself), you must also meet
the following requirements:- The reader must be on the same local network as
your point of sale device.
- The reader must be able to communicate directly with your point of sale device
through your local network.
- The DNS servers used by your point of sale device must be able to resolve
internet-routable hostnames to local IP addresses.

## Troubleshooting

When network-related issues occur, experienced personnel should be physically
present to diagnose and correct problems. Make sure you account for this when
planning your Terminal integration, deployment, and maintenance.

#### Note

Because of the large variety of network configurations and infrastructure,
Stripe can only help with basic network questions. The operation and
troubleshooting of your network is your responsibility.

If you encounter an issue, determine whether the cause is the network or
something else. You can rule out the network as the cause of an issue by
temporarily moving one or more of your Terminal readers and point of sale
devices to a different network and internet connection—then check to see if the
same issue occurs there. Mobile hotspots work well for this kind of testing.

If the issue persists on a different network and Internet connection, perform
additional testing and debugging of your integration’s code. If you need help,
[contact support](https://support.stripe.com/contact) and provide as much
technical detail as possible (for example, error messages, logs, and so on).

If the issue only happens on your network, try the following:

- Make sure your network meets all of the requirements listed above, especially
if anything about the network has changed recently.
- Check your firewall and other security configurations to make sure access to
[Stripe’s infrastructure](https://docs.stripe.com/ips) isn’t being blocked.
- Try a different connection for both the Terminal reader and your point of sale
device (for example, switch from WiFi to Ethernet).
- For WiFi, make sure all devices have good signal strength.
- For Ethernet, try using different network cables.
- Confirm smart readers have the expected IP and subnet assigned.
- If you’re using smart readers and our Terminal SDK on a separate point of sale
device:- On your point of sale device, try resolving
`10-42-42-42.test.device.stripe-terminal-local-reader.net` to an IP address.
That hostname should resolve to the IP `10.42.42.42`. If it resolves to a
different IP, or if DNS resolution fails, configure your point of sale device to
use [Cloudflare DNS servers](https://1.1.1.1/dns/) (`1.1.1.1` and `1.0.0.1`) or
[Google DNS servers](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns) (`8.8.8.8`
and `8.8.4.4`) and try again.
- Check your router’s configuration to see if connections between wireless
(WiFi) clients and wired (Ethernet) clients are being blocked.
- Make sure you can ping the Terminal reader’s IP address from your point of
sale device.
