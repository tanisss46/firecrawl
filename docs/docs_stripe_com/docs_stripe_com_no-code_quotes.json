This marks the quote as **Accepted**.\n- Go to **Convert to subscription** > **Quotes details**.\n- Enter or modify the subscription details, then click **Create subscription**.\n\nIf you schedule the subscription to start immediately, Stripe creates an active\nsubscription along with a draft invoice for the initial payment. Stripe\nfinalizes the draft invoice automatically in 1 hour. Otherwise, the subscription\nbegins on the scheduled start date. Depending on the subscription’s payment\nterms, Stripe collects payment by either charging the customer’s payment method\non file or sending them an invoice.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Accessing quotes](https://support.stripe.com/questions/how-to-access-quotes)\n- [How quotes work](https://docs.stripe.com/quotes/overview)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Pay-as-you-go](https://stripe.com/pricing)\n- [Stripe Billing pricing](https://stripe.com/billing/pricing)\n- [Invoicing pricing](https://stripe.com/invoicing/pricing)\n- [invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n- [subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating)\n- [Billing tab](https://dashboard.stripe.com/billing)\n- [quote editor](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/quotes/create)\n- [quote template](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/quote)\n- [invoice editor](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/invoices/create)\n- [Accessing quotes](https://support.stripe.com/questions/how-to-access-quotes)\n- [How quotes work](https://docs.stripe.com/quotes/overview)",
