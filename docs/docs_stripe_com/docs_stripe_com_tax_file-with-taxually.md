Stripe Tax integrates with Taxually to automate tax filing. Together, they help
you file on-time and avoid errors that can happen with manual filing.

#### Note

Tax subscription. Check your plan in the Dashboard under [Stripe
plans](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/plans).

Canada, Taxually might prompt you to create a new account with LumaTax and enter
details (for example, Department of Revenue login credentials) in the [LumaTax
portal](https://account.lumatax.com/login).

complete. After that, you can file tax returns through your Dashboard from the
Taxuall App.
