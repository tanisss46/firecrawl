An Issuing balance holds funds reserved for the card and is safely\nseparated from earnings, [payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts), and funds\nfrom other Stripe products.\n\n## Fund from a bank account\n\nYou have two options for funding an Issuing balance from an external account\nthat each have different setups: pull funding and push funding.\n\n- **Pull funding** is the default funding option in the US and isn’t available\nin the EU or the UK. You need to verify external bank accounts, which usually\ncauses a delay in transferring funds (up to 5 business days). This option allows\nyou to control and identify which bank your top-up originates from.\n- **Push funding** is available in the UK and EU and as a beta in the US. This\noptions allows you to originate the funds from your own bank account to Stripe.\nYou might be able to receive funds the same day with push funding, which depends\non the process you use (for example, ACH or wire transfer).\nPull funding (US)Push funding (US)Push funding (Euro)Push funding (UK)\nBefore you can top-up a connected account from your user’s bank account, you\nmust first collect and verify their account information. Stripe provides the\noption of collection through\n[Stripe.js](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements) with verification using\nmicrodeposits.\n\n### Collecting your users’ information\n\nTo debit the user’s bank account for funding, you will need to collect their\nbank account information and submit evidence of their authorization to debit\ntheir account. This is known as a\n[mandate](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sources/create#create_source-mandate), and\nensures both you and Stripe remain compliant with ACH network rules, as well as\nprovide you with access to evidence to ease in any dispute resolution.\n\nCreate a form that captures:\n\n- Name\n- Routing number\n- Account number\n\nAs your customers submit the mandate, you should record:\n\n- IP address\n- User agent\n- Date\n\nIf instead you prefer to collect mandates from your users *offline* (such as via\nphone or a paper agreement), you won’t upload evidence of acceptance to Stripe.\nYou should maintain your own record of the acceptance and provide us a contact\nemail in case the evidence is requested.\n\n### Creating the token and source\n\nCreate a token using the [Bank Account Token\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_bank_account), and then use it to\ncreate a source. Create both the bank account token and `source` on the\nconnected account you want to fund.\n\n#### Caution\n\nStore these `Source` tokens in your own system where your integration can\nretrieve them. Stripe currently doesn’t provide a way to programmatically\nretrieve or list the tokens after they’re created.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/tokens \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -H \"Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}\" \\\n -d \"bank_account[country]\"=US \\\n -d \"bank_account[currency]\"=usd \\\n -d \"bank_account[account_holder_name]\"=\"Jenny Rosen\" \\\n -d \"bank_account[account_holder_type]\"=individual \\\n -d \"bank_account[routing_number]\"=110000000 \\\n -d \"bank_account[account_number]\"=000000000009\n```\n\nCreate a `source` using the token you obtained:\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/sources \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -H \"Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}\" \\\n -d type=ach_debit \\\n -d currency=usd \\\n -d token={{TOKEN_ID}} \\\n -d \"owner[address][line1]\"=\"510 Townsend Street\" \\\n -d \"owner[address][city]\"=\"San Francisco\" \\\n -d \"owner[address][state]\"=California \\\n -d \"owner[address][country]\"=US \\\n --data-urlencode \"owner[email]\"=\"jenny.rosen@example.com\" \\\n -d \"owner[name]\"=\"Jenny Rosen\" \\\n -d \"owner[phone]\"=5554443333\n```\n\n### Verifying sources with microdeposits\n\nTwo small deposits with the statement description **ACCTVERIFY** are sent to the\nbank account within 1-2 days. You should collect these two amounts from your\nuser to verify the bank account.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/sources/{{SOURCE_ID}}/verify \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -H \"Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}\" \\\n -d \"values[]\"=32 \\\n -d \"values[]\"=45\n```\n\n### Top-up a connected account’s Issuing balance\n\nFund the Issuing balance on your connected account with top-ups by passing in\nthe `source` that was made and setting the `destination_balance` to `issuing`.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/topups \\\n -u sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2: \\\n -H \"Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTED_STRIPE_ACCOUNT_ID}}\" \\\n -d \"amount\"=2000 \\\n -d \"currency\"=\"usd\" \\\n -d \"description\"=\"Top-up for week of May 31\" \\\n -d \"destination_balance\"=\"issuing\" \\\n -d \"statement_descriptor\"=\"Top-up\" \\\n -d \"source\"=\"{{SOURCE_ID}}\"\n```\n\n## Fund from a connected account’s Stripe balance\n\nYou must [sign up for the Balance Transfer API private\nbeta](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/connect/funding#request-early-access) to\ntransfer funds from your Stripe balance into your Issuing balance.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/balance_transfers \\\n -u sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2: \\\n -H \"Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTED_STRIPE_ACCOUNT_ID}}\" \\\n -d amount=1000 \\\n -d currency=usd \\\n -d \"source_balance[type]\"=payments \\\n -d \"destination_balance[type]\"=issuing\n```\n\nTransfers from your connected account’s Stripe balance are instant and available\n24x7 in the US, or take 1 business day in the UK and euro area countries. This\nallows you to quickly and easily utilize earned funds from Stripe Payments for\nspend with Stripe Issuing.\n\nYou can only move an amount up to the available Stripe balance. Funds won’t be\navailable in the Issuing balance while the transfer is pending.\n\nUse the [retrieve balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/balance/balance_retrieve)\nendpoint to get your available Stripe balance amounts broken down by\n[source_type](https://docs.stripe.com/api/balance/balance_object#balance_object-available-source_types).\n\n### Request early access\n\nAccess to the Balance Transfer API is currently limited to beta users. You must\nbe an Issuing customer to join the beta. To request access to the beta, log in\nto your Stripe account and refresh the page. [Contact\nStripe](https://stripe.com/contact/sales) for more information.\n\n## Retrieve an Issuing balance\n\nTo check the current Issuing balance of a connected account, call the [Balance\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api/balance/balance_retrieve) GET endpoint and pass\nthe connected account ID into the header.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/balance \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -H \"Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}\"\n```\n\nThe`balance` object is returned with a corresponding `issuing` object that\nincludes the current available balance:\n\n```\n{\n \"object\": \"balance\",\n...\n \"issuing\": {\n \"available\": [\n {\n \"amount\": 100,\n \"currency\": \"usd\"\n }\n ]\n },\n \"livemode\": false\n}\n```\n\n## Pay out an Issuing balance to an external account\n\nThe funds in an Issuing balance can also be paid out to a connected account’s\n[external bank account](https://docs.stripe.com/api/external_accounts) using the\n[Payouts API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payouts/create) POST endpoint and\nspecifying the `source_balance` of the payout as `issuing.`\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payouts \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -H \"Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}\" \\\n -d source_balance=issuing \\\n -d amount=100 \\\n -d currency=usd\n```\n\n## Links\n\n- [Issuing balance](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/funding/balance)\n- [payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts)\n- [Stripe.js](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements)\n- [mandate](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sources/create#create_source-mandate)\n- [Bank Account Token\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_bank_account)\n- [retrieve balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/balance/balance_retrieve)\n-\n[source_type](https://docs.stripe.com/api/balance/balance_object#balance_object-available-source_types)\n- [Contact Stripe](https://stripe.com/contact/sales)\n- [external bank account](https://docs.stripe.com/api/external_accounts)\n- [Payouts API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payouts/create)",
