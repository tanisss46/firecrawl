A\ndigital certificate includes (but isn’t limited to) the host name of the server,\ninformation about the owner of the server/domain, duration of validity, and the\nidentity of a trusted [certificate authority\n(CA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority) that issued or signed\nthis certificate. A client connecting to the server performs [path\nvalidation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certification_path_validation_algorithm)\non the certificate where it verifies that the subject field of the certificate\nmatches the domain name of the server that it’s trying to connect to, the\ncertificate isn’t expired, and that a trusted CA issued the certificate. For\nmore details, you can [read about\ncertificates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate).\n\n## Certificate pinning\n\nWhen you connect to Stripe API endpoints, certificates load from a CA\ncertificates bundle that your operating system provides, or from browser or\nStripe Bindings (depending on the HTTP client used for this connection). These\ncertificates are treated as valid trusted certificates during certificate path\nvalidation. Certificate pinning is the process of restricting which certificates\nare considered valid for a particular HTTPS website or endpoint. Stripe\nrecommends against certificate pinning to avoid complications with your\nintegration when we roll out new certificates for our systems. DigiCert, one of\nthe major CAs, also recommends against [certificate\npinning](https://www.digicert.com/blog/certificate-pinning-what-is-certificate-pinning).\n\nAs a Stripe user, if you must use certificate pinning for some reason, make sure\nyou pin *only* (and **all** of) the **root** certificates listed\n[below](https://docs.stripe.com/tls-certificates#root-certificates-for-stripe-domains).\nDo **NOT** pin the entire certificate chain, the intermediate certificate, or\nthe end-entity (leaf) certificate. If you do, you run a high risk of breaking\nyour integration as Stripe updates certificates for our systems every few\nmonths, including the intermediate CA certificates.\n\nOur root certificates listed below might also change in the future, both\nroutinely and on an emergency basis. For routine changes to the list of root\ncertificates, Stripe will give seven days notice through the [API announce\nmailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/lists.stripe.com/g/api-announce)\nbefore we roll out the change. You **must** make sure that all your clients that\nconnect to Stripe APIs, including mobile applications, can handle this\ncertificate list changing with seven days notice. Emergency rotations might have\na shorter interval between notification and change.\n\n### Root certificates for Stripe domains\n\n- **DigiCert Global Root CA**\n\n- Serial #: `08:3b:e0:56:90:42:46:b1:a1:75:6a:c9:59:91:c7:4a`\n- SHA1 Fingerprint:\n`a8:98:5d:3a:65:e5:e5:c4:b2:d7:d6:6d:40:c6:dd:2f:b1:9c:54:36`\n- **DigiCert Global Root G2**\n\n- Serial #: `03:3a:f1:e6:a7:11:a9:a0:bb:28:64:b1:1d:09:fa:e5`\n- SHA1 Fingerprint:\n`df:3c:24:f9:bf:d6:66:76:1b:26:80:73:fe:06:d1:cc:8d:4f:82:a4`\n- **DigiCert Global Root G3**\n\n- Serial #: `05:55:56:bc:f2:5e:a4:35:35:c3:a4:0f:d5:ab:45:72`\n- SHA1 Fingerprint:\n`7e:04:de:89:6a:3e:66:6d:00:e6:87:d3:3f:fa:d9:3b:e8:3d:34:9e`\n- **DigiCert High Assurance EV Root CA**\n\n- Serial #: `02:ac:5c:26:6a:0b:40:9b:8f:0b:79:f2:ae:46:25:77`\n- SHA1 Fingerprint:\n`5f:b7:ee:06:33:e2:59:db:ad:0c:4c:9a:e6:d3:8f:1a:61:c7:dc:25`\n- **GlobalSign Root R3**\n\n- Serial #: `04:00:00:00:00:01:21:58:53:08:a2`\n- SHA1 Fingerprint:\n`d6:9b:56:11:48:f0:1c:77:c5:45:78:c1:09:26:df:5b:85:69:76:ad`\n- **GlobalSign Root R6**\n\n- Serial #: `45:e6:bb:03:83:33:c3:85:65:48:e6:ff:45:51`\n- SHA1 Fingerprint:\n`80:94:64:0e:b5:a7:a1:ca:11:9c:1f:dd:d5:9f:81:02:63:a7:fb:d1`\n- **GlobalSign ECC Root R5**\n\n- Serial #: `60:59:49:e0:26:2e:bb:55:f9:0a:77:8a:71:f9:4a:d8:6c`\n- SHA1 Fingerprint:\n`1f:24:c6:30:cd:a4:18:ef:20:69:ff:ad:4f:dd:5f:46:3a:1b:69:aa`\n\nYou can verify and download the above root CA certificates from\n[DigiCert](https://www.digicert.com/kb/digicert-root-certificates.htm) and\n[GlobalSign](https://support.globalsign.com/ca-certificates/root-certificates/globalsign-root-certificates).\n\n## Links\n\n- [API announce mailing\nlist](https://groups.google.com/a/lists.stripe.com/g/api-announce)\n- [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS)\n- [Transport Security Layer\n(TLS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security)\n- [TLS certificates](https://www.digicert.com/tls-ssl/tls-ssl-certificates)\n- [certificate authority\n(CA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority)\n- [path\nvalidation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certification_path_validation_algorithm)\n- [read about\ncertificates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate)\n- [certificate\npinning](https://www.digicert.com/blog/certificate-pinning-what-is-certificate-pinning)\n- [DigiCert](https://www.digicert.com/kb/digicert-root-certificates.htm)\n-\n[GlobalSign](https://support.globalsign.com/ca-certificates/root-certificates/globalsign-root-certificates)",
