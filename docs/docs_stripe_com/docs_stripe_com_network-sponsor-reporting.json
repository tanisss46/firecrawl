  "content": "# Network Sponsor Reporting\n\n## Learn about the available reports for our network sponsors.\n\n## Stripe Reports\n\nAll reports are provided as CSV files over SFTP. The available reports are:\n\n- **Daily Settlement Report**: a same-day summary report of transaction volume\n- **Clearing Transaction Detail Report**: a daily transaction-level report of\ncleared transactions\n- **Dispute Event Report**: a daily transaction-level report of events related\nto disputes\n- **Transaction Summary Report**: a periodic per-merchant summary of processed\nvolume\n- **Merchant Report**: a list of events related to merchant metadata\n\nFilenames are customizable.\n\n### CSV\n\nCSV files are as described in [RFC 4180](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180):\n\n- Fields are optionally delimited by `\"` quotes.- When they’re, `\"\"` inside is\nused to represent a single quote and fields can contain commas\n- In the example below, the first value is `\"quoted, field\"`\n- Dates will always be in `YYYY-MM-DD` format and in UTC time.\n- Headers will always be present\n- Blank fields will either be an empty delimited field (`\"\"`) or just nothing\nbetween commas. Both the `example_header` and `a_date_field` values in the\nsecond row of the below sample are empty.\n\n#### Sample\n\n```\nexample_header,a_date_field,an_amount,a_currency\n\"\"\"quoted, field\"\"\",2016-06-03,12345,usd\n\"\",,12345,jpy\n\n```\n\n### Amounts\n\nAmounts are always:\n\n- provided as an integer\n- accompanied by a three-letter currency code\n- in the smallest unit for the currency (cents, pence, centavos, etc)\n\nFor example `12345,usd` is USD $123.45 and `12345,jpy` is JPY ¥12345\n\n### Backward compatibility\n\nIn the same vein as our [API Backward-Compatibility\nGuidelines](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#what-changes-does-stripe-consider-to-be-backward-compatible),\nwe consider the following changes to be backward compatible:\n\n- Adding new rightmost columns to the CSV reports\n- Adding new values to `type` fields\n\n## Daily Settlement Report\n\nEach line of this report is a summary of transactions for one reconciliation\nwindow for Visa and Mastercard.\n\n### Fields\n\n- `brand`: either `visa` or `mastercard`\n- `network_numeric`: for Visa, the BIN; for Mastercard, the ICA.\n- `settlement_service`: an identifier for the settlement service used for the\ntransactions- For Visa, see the full list of possible values below\n- For Mastercard, the identifier from the *Settlement Manual* is used\n- `reconciliation_date`: the processing date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.\n- `reconciliation_cycle`: which cycle is summarized\n- `type`: which transactions are included in the aggregation. Valid values are:-\n`first_presentment`\n- `first_chargeback`\n- `second_presentment`\n- `second_chargeback`(includes prearbitration withdrawals for Visa)\n- `interchange` (interchange reimbursement fees)\n- `scheme_fee`\n- `miscellaneous`\n- `amount`: the amount as an integer number of minor units, possibly with a\nleading `-` to denote a negative amount. Amounts in this report are relative to\nStripe, so a positive amount means money flowing to Stripe.\n- `currency`: the three-letter currency code\n\n### Sample\n\n```\n\nbrand,network_numeric,settlement_service,reconciliation_date,reconciliation_cycle,type,amount,currency\nmastercard,010100,US00000001,2017-03-24,1,first_presentment,3800,usd\nmastercard,010100,US00000001,2017-03-24,1,interchange,-21,usd\nmastercard,010100,US00000001,2017-03-24,2,scheme_fee,-1000,usd\nvisa,444000,international,2017-03-24,1,first_presentment,247400,usd\nvisa,444000,international,2017-03-24,1,interchange,-784,usd\n\n```\n\n## Clearing Transaction Detail Report\n\nThis report contains records for cleared charges and refunds. It has a number of\nlimitations:\n\n- Some of the listed transactions may later fail in clearing. This means that\nthis report cannot be reconciled against other reports counting successfully\nsettled transactions.\n- The clearing date in this report reflects the date the clearing attempt was\ncreated internally within Stripe, and may not be the same as the date the\ntransaction is eventually processed.\n- The amount is in the presentment currency of the transaction, so cannot be\nused to reconcile to cash.\n\n### Fields\n\n- `date`: the date this transaction was submitted for clearing\n- `brand`: either `visa` or `mastercard`\n- `merchant`: the unique identifier assigned by Stripe\n- `card_number`: the first six and last four digits of the card number,\nseparated with an asterisk `*`\n- `acquirer_reference_number`: the acquirer reference number sent with clearing\n- `type`: the type of transaction.
