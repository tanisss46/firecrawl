# Website checklist

## Make sure your website aligns with card network standards and e-commerce best practices.

This page contains a list of the common elements—such as accurate product
descriptions, clear policies, and proper security features—that each business on
Stripe should address on its website. Adhering to these recommendations reduces
the risk of customer confusion and disputes. It also helps you meet Stripe’s
standards and the standards set by the credit card networks.

card network rules, feel free to use the Stripe Shop Terms as a starting point
as you build your site.

- A description of what you are selling
Besides only listing the name of the product or service, you can help customers
with their purchasing decision by providing detailed text descriptions of what
you’re selling. For physical goods, include multiple pictures and information
about material, colors, and other details. This is also an important measure to
protect against potential disputes: setting the right expectations up front
gives your customers a clear idea of what they get for their money.

If we review your website and find that it isn’t clear what you’re selling, we
may contact you with recommendations for improving the description.
- The purchase currency
To support international purchasers, clearly display the currency associated
with the prices on your site. Listing only the currency symbol may not be
enough, so be as explicit as possible when showing prices.
- Customer service contact information
Make sure your customers can find multiple contact methods on your site,
including direct communication channels, such as email addresses, phone numbers,
and live chat (something besides contact forms). Low-friction communication is
key to providing a good customer experience and heading off misunderstandings
early on, helping to avoid disputes.

​​If we review your website and can’t find a clear way to contact you, we may
ask that you add some contact options to the site.
- Your fulfillment policies
For most businesses, you must clearly explain your order fulfillment policies to
your customers. Some examples of policies required for many businesses include:

- Refund policy: Describe the conditions under which customers can receive a
refund.
- Shipping or delivery policy: Describe shipping methods, times, and rates, as
well as eligible destinations.
- Return policy and process: Describe the conditions under which customers can
return purchased goods and the return process.
- Cancellation policy: Describe the conditions under which customers can cancel
subscriptions or reservations.

#### Note

Businesses that have no fulfillment process, such as those that only offer
in-person services or that only process charitable donations, don’t have to
include fulfillment policies.

Communicating clear and fair fulfillment policies builds customer trust and can
protect you against disputes. If your website doesn’t include sufficient
information about your fulfillment policies, we might request that you add it.
If you aren’t sure what information you need to add, or you want us to review
updates that you’ve made in response to our request, [contact Stripe
Support](https://support.stripe.com/).
- Legal or export restrictions applicable to your business
Certain products and services are subject to restrictions. Properly disclosing
any applicable restrictions and how they may impact your customers helps build
trust with them.
- Your website's privacy policy
Consumer data privacy is now a priority for legislation and governments around
the world. Clearly explaining your website’s privacy policy helps you both
comply with privacy laws and helps your customers understand how their data is
protected, used, or disclosed.
- Your business address
If you have a physical address, listing it on your website adds credibility for
your business.
- The terms of any promotions you are offering
Clearly disclose the conditions of any promotion, discount, or trial that you
offer to customers. Display a link or disclaimer text so that it’s visible when
customers agree to participate. Transparency around these conditions can help
avoid confusion and disputes.
- The security of your website and customer payment information
Make sure that your customers know that you comply with the PCI standards. You
can learn more about what [PCI
compliance](https://docs.stripe.com/security/guide#validating-pci-compliance)
means for Stripe by reading about [integration
security](https://docs.stripe.com/security). Ensure that your website
(especially your payment form) uses HTTPS and other security best practices and
is not susceptible to [card
testing](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/card-testing). You must
also explain that your customer’s payment information is handled safely when
doing business with you.
- The logos of the credit cards you accept
You can reduce friction in the checkout process by displaying the brand logos of
the credit cards that you accept, making it clear to customers that you accept
their preferred card.
