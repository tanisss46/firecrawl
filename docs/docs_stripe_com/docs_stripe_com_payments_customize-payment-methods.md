# Customize payment methods

## Choose how the Payment Element displays payment methods.

The Payment Element supports many payment methods. It displays the payment
methods you enabled, hides any that won’t work for the current transaction, and
sorts them dynamically for the best conversion rates.

You can customize its behavior in these ways:

- [Enable different payment
methods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/customize-payment-methods#enable-different-payment-methods).
- [Sort payment
methods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/customize-payment-methods#sort-payment-methods)
differently than the default.
- [Limit the number of payment
methods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/customize-payment-methods#limit-payment-method-count)
displayed.

## Enable different payment methods

You can specify [Dynamic payment
methods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/dynamic-payment-methods)
to enable different payment methods by selecting them in the
[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods). Stripe
enables this functionality by default in the latest version of the API.

This allows Stripe to pull your payment method preferences from the Dashboard to
dynamically show the most relevant payment methods to your customers.
Alternatively, you can [list payment
methods](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-payment_method_types)
manually using payment method types.

There’s one situation where the Payment Element overrides your choice. It hides
payment methods that don’t support the current payment. For instance, in a
recurring payment for 10 JPY, the Payment Element hides methods that don’t
support JPY or recurring payments.

## Sort payment methods

By default, the Payment Element uses dynamic ordering to optimize which payment
methods appear for each user. With the
[paymentMethodOrder](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_payment_element#payment_element_create-options-paymentMethodOrder)
parameter, you can override the default order for payment methods in the Payment
Element, including Apple Pay and Google Pay.

Payment methods that you specify in `paymentMethodOrder` are shown first,
followed by any additional payment methods. If you specify payment method types
that Stripe wouldn’t show, they’re ignored.

```
elements.create('payment', {
 paymentMethodOrder: ['apple_pay', 'google_pay', 'card', 'klarna']
});
```

You can include Apple Pay (`apple_pay`) and Google Pay (`google_pay`) when
setting the order for payment methods in addition to a full list of [payment
method
types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object#payment_method_object-type).
When you specify sorting, Stripe applies dynamic ordering to any remaining
available payment methods.

#### Regional considerationsFinlandSweden

Regulations in
[Finland](https://support.stripe.com/questions/payment-method-legislation-in-finland)
and
[Sweden](https://support.stripe.com/questions/payment-method-legislation-in-sweden)
require that debit payment methods must be presented before credit payment
methods at checkout in those countries.

## Limit the number of payment methods

When you use the [accordion
layout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element#layout), the Payment
Element displays up to five payment methods by default and hides the rest behind
a **More** button.

To adjust the number of payment methods you want to display, set the
[layout.visibleAccordionItemsCount](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_payment_element#payment_element_create-options-layout-visibleAccordionItemsCount)
property.

```
elements.create('payment', {
 layout: {
 type: 'accordion',
 // Set a different default, or set to 0 to disable the
 // "More" button and render all available Payment Methods
 visibleAccordionItemsCount: 3
 }
});
```
