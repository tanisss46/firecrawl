  "content": "# Build two-step confirmationLegacy\n\n## Add an optional review page or run validations after a user enters their payment details.\n\n#### Warning\n\nYou’re currently viewing an unsupported implementation. If you’re using an older\nintegration with `createPaymentMethod`, we recommend you use our latest docs to\n[Build two-step\nconfirmation](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/build-a-two-step-confirmation)\nand [Migrate to Confirmation\nTokens](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element/migration-ct).\n\nWhile we recommend the [standard\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment-deferred) for\nmost scenarios, this integration allows you to add an extra step in your\ncheckout. This provides the buyer an opportunity to review their order details\nor for you to run additional validations before confirming the order.\n\n[Set up\nStripe](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/build-a-two-step-confirmation-legacy#set-up-stripe)\nFirst, you need a Stripe account. [Register\nnow](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register).\n\nUse our official libraries for access to the Stripe API from your application:\n\n```\n# Available as a gem\nsudo gem install stripe\n```\n\n```\n# If you use bundler, you can add this line to your Gemfile\ngem 'stripe'\n```\n\n[Enable payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/build-a-two-step-confirmation-legacy#enable-payment-methods)\n#### Caution\n\nThis integration path doesn’t support BLIK or pre-authorized debits that use the\nAutomated Clearing Settlement System (ACSS).\n\nView your [payment methods\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and enable the\npayment methods you want to support. You need at least one payment method\nenabled to create a\n[PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents).\n\nBy default, Stripe enables cards and other prevalent payment methods that can\nhelp you reach more customers, but we recommend turning on additional payment\nmethods that are relevant for your business and customers. See [Payment method\nsupport](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/payment-method-support)\nfor product and payment method support, and our [pricing\npage](https://stripe.com/pricing/local-payment-methods) for fees.\n\n[Collect payment\ndetailsClient-side](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/build-a-two-step-confirmation-legacy#web-collect-payment-details)\nYou’re ready to collect payment details on the client with the Payment Element.\nThe Payment Element is a prebuilt UI component that simplifies collecting\npayment details for a variety of payment methods.\n\nThe Payment Element contains an iframe that securely sends payment information\nto Stripe over an HTTPS connection. Avoid placing the Payment Element within\nanother iframe because some payment methods require redirecting to another page\nfor payment confirmation.\n\nThe checkout page address must start with `https://` rather than `http://` for\nyour integration to work. You can test your integration without using HTTPS, but\nremember to [enable it](https://docs.stripe.com/security/guide#tls) when you’re\nready to accept live payments.\n\nHTML + JSReact\n### Set up Stripe.js\n\nThe Payment Element is automatically available as a feature of Stripe.js.\nInclude the Stripe.js script on your checkout page by adding it to the `head` of\nyour HTML file. Always load Stripe.js directly from js.stripe.com to remain PCI\ncompliant. Don’t include the script in a bundle or host a copy of it yourself.\n\n```\n<head>\n <title>Checkout</title>\n <script src=\"https://js.stripe.com/v3/\"></script>\n</head>\n```\n\nCreate an instance of Stripe with the following JavaScript on your checkout\npage:\n\n```\n// Set your publishable key: remember to change this to your live publishable\nkey in production\n// See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys\nconst stripe = Stripe('pk_test_TYooMQauvdEDq54NiTphI7jx');\n```\n\n### Add the Payment Element to your checkout page\n\nThe Payment Element needs a place to live on your checkout page. Create an empty\nDOM node (container) with a unique ID in your payment form:\n\n```\n<form id=\"payment-form\">\n <div id=\"payment-element\">\n <!-- Elements will create form elements here -->\n </div>\n <button id=\"submit\">Submit</button>\n <div id=\"error-message\">\n <!-- Display error message to your customers here -->\n </div>\n</form>\n```\n\nWhen the form above has loaded, create an Elements instance with the mode,\namount, and currency. These values determine which payment methods are shown to\nyour customer.\n\nThen, create an instance of the Payment Element and mount it to the container\nDOM node.\n\n```\nconst options = {\n mode: 'payment',\n amount: 1099,\n currency: 'usd',\n paymentMethodCreation: 'manual',\n // Fully customizable with appearance API.\n appearance: {/*...*/},\n};\n\n// Set up Stripe.js and Elements to use in checkout form\nconst elements = stripe.elements(options);\n\n// Create and mount the Payment Element\nconst paymentElementOptions = { layout: 'accordion'};\nconst paymentElement = elements.create('payment', paymentElementOptions);\npaymentElement.mount('#payment-element');\n```\n\nThe Payment Element renders a dynamic form that allows your customer to pick a\npayment method. The form automatically collects all necessary payments details\nfor the payment method selected by the customer.\n\nYou can customize the Payment Element to match the design of your site by\npassing the [appearance object](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/appearance-api)\ninto `options` when creating the `Elements` provider.\n\n### Collect addresses\n\nBy default, the Payment Element only collects the necessary billing address\ndetails. To collect a customer’s full billing address (to calculate the tax for\ndigital goods and services, for example) or shipping address, use the [Address\nElement](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/address-element).\n\n[OptionalCustomize the\nlayoutClient-side](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/build-a-two-step-confirmation-legacy#customize-layout)[OptionalCustomize\nthe\nappearanceClient-side](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/build-a-two-step-confirmation-legacy#customize-appearance)[OptionalSave\nand retrieve customer payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/build-a-two-step-confirmation-legacy#save-payment-methods)[OptionalAdditional\nElements\noptionsClient-side](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/build-a-two-step-confirmation-legacy#additional-options)[Create\na\nPaymentMethodClient-side](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/build-a-two-step-confirmation-legacy#create-pm)\nWhen the customer submits your payment form, you can create a\n[PaymentMethod](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods) to send to your\nserver for additional validation or business logic prior to confirmation.\n\n#### Caution\n\nYou must immediately use a created PaymentMethod to confirm a PaymentIntent or\nSetupIntent and attach it to a [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers)\nif you intend to use it in the future.\n\nHTML + JSReact\n```\nconst form = document.getElementById('payment-form');\nconst submitBtn = document.getElementById('submit');\n\nconst handleError = (error) => {\n const messageContainer = document.querySelector('#error-message');\n messageContainer.textContent = error.message;\n submitBtn.disabled = false;\n}\n\nform.addEventListener('submit', async (event) => {\n // We don't want to let default form submission happen here,\n // which would refresh the page.\n event.preventDefault();\n\n // Prevent multiple form submissions\n if (submitBtn.disabled) {\n return;\n }\n\n // Disable form submission while loading\n submitBtn.disabled = true;\n\n // Trigger form validation and wallet collection\n const {error: submitError} = await elements.submit();\n if (submitError) {\n handleError(submitError);\n return;\n }\n\n // Create the PaymentMethod using the details collected by the Payment Element\n const {error, paymentMethod} = await stripe.createPaymentMethod({\n elements,\n params: {\n billing_details: {\n name: 'Jenny Rosen',\n }\n }\n });\n\n if (error) {\n // This point is only reached if there's an immediate error when\n// creating the PaymentMethod. Show the error to your customer (for example,\npayment details incomplete)\n handleError(error);\n return;\n }\n\n// Now that you have a PaymentMethod, you can use it in the following steps to\nrender a confirmation page or run additional validations on the server\n});\n```\n\n[Show the payment method details on the confirmation\npage](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/build-a-two-step-confirmation-legacy#show-details)\nAt this point, you have all of the information you need to render the\nconfirmation page. Call the server to obtain the necessary information and\nrender the confirmation page accordingly.\n\n```\n// Using Express\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\napp.use(express.json());\n\napp.post('/summarize-payment', async (req, res) => {\n try {\n let details;\n if (request.body.payment_method_id) {\n const intent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({\n payment_method: request.body.payment_method_id,\n amount: 1099,\n currency: 'usd',\n// In the latest version of the API, specifying the `automatic_payment_methods`\nparameter is optional because Stripe enables its functionality by default.\n automatic_payment_methods: {enabled: true},\n { expand: ['payment_method'] }\n });\n details = summarizePaymentMethod(intent.payment_method);\n }\n // Send the response to the client\n response.send(generateResponse(details));\n } catch (e) {\n // Display error on client\n return response.send({ error: e.message });\n }\n});\n\nfunction summarizePaymentMethod(paymentMethod) {\n // Use paymentMethod.type to derive the applicable summary fields for your UI\n}\n```\n\n```\nconst fetchAndRenderSummary = async () => {\n const res = await fetch('/summarize-payment', {\n method: \"POST\",\n body: JSON.stringify({ payment_method_id: '{PAYMENT_METHOD_ID}' });\n });\n\n const summary = await res.json();\n\n // Render the summary object returned by your server\n};\n```\n\n[Submit the payment to\nStripe](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/build-a-two-step-confirmation-legacy#submit-payment)\nWhen your user confirms their order, use\n[stripe.confirmPayment](https://docs.stripe.com/js/payment_intents/confirm_payment)\nto complete the payment with the details they entered into the Payment Element.\nProvide a\n[return_url](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-return_url)\nto this function to indicate where Stripe needs to redirect the user after they\ncomplete the payment. Your user might be redirected to an intermediate site\nfirst (such as a bank authorization page) before being redirected to the\n`return_url`. Card payments immediately redirect to the `return_url` when a\npayment is successful.\n\nIf you don’t want to redirect for card payments, set\n[redirect](https://docs.stripe.com/js/payment_intents/confirm_payment#confirm_payment_intent-options-redirect)\nto `if_required`. This only redirects customers that check out with\nredirect-based payment methods.\n\n```\nconst form = document.getElementById('payment-form');\n\nform.addEventListener('submit', async (event) => {\n event.preventDefault();\n\n const {error} = await stripe.confirmPayment({\n clientSecret: '{PAYMENT_INTENT_CLIENT_SECRET}',\n confirmParams: {\n return_url: 'https://example.com/order/123/complete',\n },\n });\n\n if (error) {\n // This point will only be reached if there is an immediate error when\n // confirming the payment. Show error to your customer.\n const messageContainer = document.querySelector('#error-message');\n messageContainer.textContent = error.message;\n } else {\n // Your customer will be redirected to your `return_url`. For some payment\n // methods like iDEAL, your customer will be redirected to an intermediate\n // site first to authorize the payment, then redirected to the `return_url`.\n }\n});\n```\n\n## Disclose Stripe to your customers\n\nStripe collects information on customer interactions with Elements to provide\nservices to you, prevent fraud, and improve its services.
