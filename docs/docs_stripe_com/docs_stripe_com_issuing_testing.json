  "content": "# Testing Issuing\n\n## Learn how to test your integration and simulate purchases.\n\nYou can issue cards and simulate purchases using your own Stripe integration in\ntest mode. This allows you to test your integration before you go live without\nhaving to make real purchases. You can only use these cards for testing within\nyour Stripe account and not for external purchases.\n\n#### Caution\n\nWhen testing your [authorization\nendpoint](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/purchases/authorizations), make sure\nthat you have set the endpoint for test mode in your [Issuing\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/issuing). Toggle **View test\ndata** to switch between test and live mode data and settings.\n\n## Fund your test mode Issuing balance\n\nBefore you create test mode transactions, you must add test mode funds to the\nIssuing balance on your account. These aren’t real funds, and you can only use\nthem for simulating purchases in test mode.\n\n### Issuing users in the US\n\nIssuing users in the US use “pull” funding, and use *Top-ups* to fund their\nIssuing balance. You can create test mode top-ups in the Dashboard, or with the\n[Top-ups API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/topups/create). Learn more about\nfunding Issuing balances for [US\nusers](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/funding/balance?push-pull-preference=pull).\n\n### Issuing users in the UK and euro area\n\nTo top up their balance, Issuing users in the UK and Europe “push” funds using\n*Funding Instructions*. You can do this in the test mode Dashboard, or with the\n[Funding Instructions API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/funding_instructions).\nLearn more about funding Issuing balances for [UK and euro area\nusers](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/funding/balance?push-pull-preference=push).\n\nWithout codeWith code\nYou can simulate a card purchase by specifying authorization details in the\nDashboard.\n\n[Create a\ncardDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/testing#without-code-create-card)\nUse the [API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards) or the\n[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/issuing/cards) to create a cardholder\nand card in test mode.\n\n[Create a test\npurchaseDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/testing#without-code-create-test-purchase)\nNavigate to the [Issuing Cards page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/issuing/cards)\nin test mode, find your newly-created card, then click **Create test purchase**.\n\nYou can select to create either an\n[Authorization](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/object) or\n[Transaction](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/transactions/object) by force\ncapture.\n\nDepending on your selection, you can provide a number of properties, such as\namount, business data, and so on.\n\nClick **Submit** to create the purchase. If you selected authorization and have\nconfigured your [synchronous\nwebhook](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/controls/real-time-authorizations), you\ncan use it to approve or decline the authorization. The browser redirects to the\npage for the newly-created authorization.\n\n[Create a\ncaptureDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/testing#without-code-create-test-capture)\nTo create a test capture with an authorization in the Dashboard, enter test mode\nand complete the following steps:\n\n- Navigate to the\n[Authorizations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/issuing/authorizations) page under\n**Issued Cards**.\n- Click the authorization you want to capture, then click **Capture**.\n\nYou can capture an authorization for an amount that’s lesser, greater, or\nequivalent to the authorized total. You can also [capture multiple\ntimes](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/purchases/transactions?issuing-capture-type=multi_capture)\nregardless of the authorization’s current state.\n\nEnter the amount you want to capture, then click **Submit** to create the\ncapture.
