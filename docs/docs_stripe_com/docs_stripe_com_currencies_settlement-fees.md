# Settling in additional currencies

## Learn how paying out funds in currencies other than your primary currency affects your processing fees.

International businesses might need to settle and pay out funds in different
currencies. The processing fees you pay depend on how you settle funds
internationally.

## Settling in a different currency

When you settle funds to your Stripe account in a currency other than the
primary currency of your Stripe account country, Stripe applies processing fees
in that currency. Use the table below to see the acquiring fees for card usage
in each currency.

## Payouts in a different currency

Any payouts from your Stripe account in a currency other than the primary
currency of the country of the recipient bank account incur a fee. Certain
payouts to non-domestic bank accounts also incur a fee. For more information on
payout fees, see our [payout docs](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts).
