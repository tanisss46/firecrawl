  "content": "# Manage connected accounts with the Dashboard\n\n## Learn about using the Stripe Dashboard to find and manage connected accounts.\n\nYou can use the Dashboard to inspect, support, and better understand your\nplatform’s connected accounts. Some common tasks supported by the Dashboard\ninclude:\n\n- [Understand and manage your Connect payments\nbusiness](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard/understand-your-connect-business)\n- [View all\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard/viewing-all-accounts)\n- [Review actionable\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard/review-actionable-accounts)\n- [Create\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard/managing-individual-accounts#creating-accounts)\n- [Find individual\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard/managing-individual-accounts#finding-accounts)\n- [Update account\ninformation](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard/managing-individual-accounts#updating-accounts)\n- [Send funds to\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard/managing-individual-accounts#sending-funds)\n\n[Viewing all\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard/viewing-all-accounts)\nprovides a high-level view of your connected accounts. By default, all accounts\nare displayed on the [accounts\noverview](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/accounts/overview) page, but you\ncan filter by account status, balance, and other attributes. Filtering accounts\nis useful because it allows you to:\n\n- View accounts that are restricted or have other issues that you can help\nresolve.\n- View your largest accounts.\n- View accounts based on their status.\n\nThe other workflows, like inspecting accounts and sending funds, are actions you\ncan take on [individual\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard/managing-individual-accounts).\nThese actions are generally made after you know which accounts need to be\ninspected or modified.\n\nBefore viewing and making changes to accounts, learn more about the [status\nbadges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard#status-badges) displayed in\nthe Dashboard.\n\n## Status badges\n\nStatus badges provide a quick way to understand the status of an account. You\ncan hover over the badges to view contextual information, and you can click the\n[status\ntabs](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard/viewing-all-accounts#tabs-workflows)\nto view accounts grouped by that status. Status badges include:\n\nStatusBadge[Restricted](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard#restricted)Restricted[Restricted\nsoon](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard#restricted-soon)Restricted\nsoon[Pending](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard#pending) (enabled or\ndisabled)Pending or\nPending[Enabled](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard#enabled)Enabled[Complete](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard#complete)Complete[Rejected](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard#rejected)Rejected\n### Restricted\n\n**Restricted** means the account has [payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts)\nor payments disabled. Additional information usually needs to be collected to\nenable these accounts. Hovering over the status badge displays:\n\n- Which capability is disabled (payouts or payments).\n\nIf information is required to enable the account, it appears in an **Actions\nrequired** list at the top of the connected account details page.\n\n### Restricted soon\n\n**Restricted soon** means the account has a due date for providing additional\ninformation.\n\nIf information is required to enable the account, it appears in an **Actions\nrequired** list at the top of the connected account details page.\n\n### Pending\n\n**Pending** means the account is being reviewed or verified by Stripe. This\noccurs when:\n\n- Stripe is verifying the information that was provided, such as an ID document\nupload.\n- Stripe is performing a watchlist check against a list of prohibited\nindividuals and businesses.\n- Stripe is reviewing the account for suspected fraudulent activity.\n\nPayouts can be enabled or disabled for accounts with a pending status and\nrequires no action on your part. Stripe automatically updates the account’s\nstatus when the review finishes.\n\n### Enabled\n\n**Enabled** means the account is in good standing, though additional information\nmight be required if another payment volume\n[threshold](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/identity-verification#verification-requirements)\nis reached. Hovering over the status badge displays:\n\n- What information Stripe might request in the future.\n\nIn the account’s\n[requirements](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-requirements)\nhash, the array `eventually_due` contains at least one requirement, but payments\nand payouts are enabled and `current_deadline` is empty.\n\n### Complete\n\n**Complete** means the account provided all the required information and is in\ngood standing.\n\nIn the account’s\n[requirements](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-requirements)\nhash, the array `eventually_due` is empty.\n\n### Rejected\n\n**Rejected** means you (the platform) or Stripe rejected the connected account.\nHovering over the status badge displays:\n\n- Whether the account was rejected by you (the platform), or by Stripe.\n\nCheck the **Actions required** list at the top of the connected account details\npage to see the reason the account was rejected. In general, accounts are\nrejected by Stripe if they’re suspected of fraudulent activity.\n\n## Use Platform Branding for Connected Accounts\n\nAs the platform, you can initialize newly created connected accounts with your\nplatform branding settings. To do so, navigate to **Connect Settings** >\n**Branding** and enable ** Platform Branding**. After you enable it, all new\naccounts onboarding to your platform receive the same branding settings as your\nplatform.\n\nUse [Account Update](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/update) to update the\naccount’s branding after creation.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Viewing all\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard/viewing-all-accounts)\n- [Managing individual\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard/managing-individual-accounts)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Understand and manage your Connect payments\nbusiness](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard/understand-your-connect-business)\n- [View all\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard/viewing-all-accounts)\n- [Review actionable\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard/review-actionable-accounts)\n- [Create\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard/managing-individual-accounts#creating-accounts)\n- [Find individual\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard/managing-individual-accounts#finding-accounts)\n- [Update account\ninformation](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard/managing-individual-accounts#updating-accounts)\n- [Send funds to\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard/managing-individual-accounts#sending-funds)\n- [accounts overview](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/accounts/overview)\n- [individual\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard/managing-individual-accounts)\n- [status\ntabs](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard/viewing-all-accounts#tabs-workflows)\n- [payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts)\n-\n[threshold](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/identity-verification#verification-requirements)\n-\n[requirements](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-requirements)\n- [Account Update](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/update)",
