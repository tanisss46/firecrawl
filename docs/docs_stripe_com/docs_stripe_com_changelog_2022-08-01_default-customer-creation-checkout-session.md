# Default customer creation in Checkout Session payment mode changed to if_requiredBreaking changes

## What’s new

When creating a Checkout Session and specifying the `mode` as `payment`, the
default value of `customer_creation` has changed from `always` to `if_required`.

## Impact

This change gives you more flexibility in how customers are created. Instead of
always creating a customer, the customer is only created if it’s required,
reducing the unnecessary creation of a customer.
