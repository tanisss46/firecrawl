# Build an in-app payments integration

Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements/mobile-payment-element) to
build a customized payments integration and checkout flows for your iOS,
Android, and React Native apps. You can build Mobile Payment Element
integrations with two different types of payment UIs using the Payment Intents
API: [Payment
Sheets](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/mobile/integration#compare-features-and-availability)
or [Embedded Payment
Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/mobile/integration#compare-features-and-availability).
