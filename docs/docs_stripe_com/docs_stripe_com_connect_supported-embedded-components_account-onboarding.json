In addition, Embedded onboarding handles all business types,\nvarious configurations of company representatives, document uploads, identity\nverification, and verification statuses. For more information, see [Embedded\nonboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/embedded-onboarding).\n\nSizeDesktopLocale (United States)This demo is read-only with limited\nfunctionality. Visit [furever.dev](https://furever.dev/) for a fully functional\ndemo.\n## Requirements collection options\n\nWith embedded onboarding, you can control the collection of `currently_due` or\n`eventually_due` requirements, along with the inclusion of [future\nrequirements](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/handle-verification-updates). You\ncan customize this behavior by using the `collectionOptions` attribute when\nintegrating the account onboarding component.\n\n## External account collection\n\nUse the\n[external_account_collection](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions/create#create_account_session-components-account_onboarding-features-external_account_collection)\nfeature to control whether the component collects external account information.\nThis parameter is enabled by default, and only platforms responsible for\ncollecting updated information when requirements are due or change (including\nCustom accounts) can disable it. When `external_account_collection` is enabled,\n[user\nauthentication](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components#user-authentication-in-connect-embedded-components)\nis required. You can opt out of Stripe user authentication with the\n[disable_stripe_user_authentication](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions/create#create_account_session-components-account_onboarding-features-disable_stripe_user_authentication)\nparameter.\n\n## Disable Stripe user authentication\n\nUse the\n[disable_stripe_user_authentication](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions/create#create_account_session-components-account_onboarding-features-disable_stripe_user_authentication)\nfeature to control whether the component requires Stripe user authentication.\nThe default value is the opposite of the\n[external_account_collection](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions/create#create_account_session-components-account_onboarding-features-external_account_collection)\nvalue. For example, if you don’t set `external_account_collection`, it defaults\nto true and `disable_stripe_user_authentication` defaults to false. This value\ncan only be true for accounts where `controller.requirement_collection` is\n`application`.\n\nWe recommend implementing 2FA or equivalent security measures as a [best\npractice](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/risk-management/best-practices#prevent-account-take-overs).\nFor account configurations that support this feature, such as Custom accounts,\nyou assume liability for connected accounts if they can’t pay back [negative\nbalances](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/risk-management/best-practices#decide-your-approach-to-negative-balance-liability).\n\n## Customize policies shown to your users\n\nConnected accounts see Stripe’s service agreement and [Privacy\nPolicy](https://stripe.com/privacy) during embedded onboarding. Connected\naccount users who haven’t [accepted Stripe’s services\nagreement](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/service-agreement-types#accepting-the-correct-agreement)\nmust accept it on the final onboarding screen. Embedded onboarding also has a\nfooter with links to Stripe’s service agreement and [Privacy\nPolicy](https://stripe.com/privacy).\n\nFor connected accounts where the platform is responsible for requirement\ncollection, you have additional options to customize the onboarding flow, as\noutlined below.\n\n### Handle service agreement acceptance on your own\n\nIf you’re a platform onboarding connected accounts where you’re responsible for\nrequirement collection, you can [collect Terms of Service\nacceptance](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/updating-service-agreements#tos-acceptance)\nusing your own process instead of using the embedded account onboarding\ncomponent. If using your own process, the final onboarding screen only asks your\nconnected accounts to confirm the information they entered, and you must secure\ntheir acceptance of Stripe’s service agreement.\n\nEmbedded onboarding still has links to the terms of service (for example, in the\nfooter) that you can replace by [linking to your own agreements and privacy\npolicy](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/supported-embedded-components/account-onboarding#link-to-your-own-agreements-and-privacy-policy).\n\n### Link to your agreements and privacy policy\n\nConnected accounts see the Stripe service agreement and [Privacy\nPolicy](https://stripe.com/privacy) throughout embedded onboarding. For the\nconnected accounts where you’re responsible for requirement collection, you can\nreplace the links with your own agreements and policy. Follow the instructions\nto [incorporate the Stripe services\nagreement](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/updating-service-agreements#adding-stripes-service-agreement-to-your-terms-of-service)\nand [link to the Stripe Privacy\nPolicy](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/updating-service-agreements#disclosing-how-stripe-processes-user-data).\n\n## Create an Account Session\n\nWhen [creating an Account\nSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions/create), enable account\nonboarding by specifying `account_onboarding` in the `components` parameter.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/account_sessions \\\n -u \"sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:\" \\\n -d account={{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}} \\\n -d \"components[account_onboarding][enabled]\"=true \\\n-d \"components[account_onboarding][features][external_account_collection]\"=true\n```\n\nAfter creating the Account Session and [initializing\nConnectJS](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components#account-sessions),\nyou can render the Account onboarding component in the front end:\n\n```\n// Include this element in your HTML\nconst accountOnboarding = stripeConnectInstance.create('account-onboarding');\naccountOnboarding.setOnExit(() => {\n console.log('User exited the onboarding flow');\n});\ncontainer.appendChild(accountOnboarding);\n\n// Optional: make sure to follow our policy instructions above\n// accountOnboarding.setFullTermsOfServiceUrl('{{URL}}')\n// accountOnboarding.setRecipientTermsOfServiceUrl('{{URL}}')\n// accountOnboarding.setPrivacyPolicyUrl('{{URL}}')\n// accountOnboarding.setSkipTermsOfServiceCollection(false)\n// accountOnboarding.setCollectionOptions({\n// fields: 'eventually_due',\n// futureRequirements: 'include',\n// })\n// accountOnboarding.setOnStepChange((stepChange) => {\n// console.log(`User entered: ${stepChange.step}`);\n// });\n```\n\nHTML +\nJSReactMethodTypeDescriptionDefault`setFullTermsOfServiceUrl``string`Absolute\nURL to your [full terms of\nservice](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/service-agreement-types#full)\nagreement.[Stripe’s full service\nagreement](https://stripe.com/connect-account/legal/full)`setRecipientTermsOfServiceUrl``string`Absolute\nURL to your [recipient terms of\nservice](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/service-agreement-types#recipient)\nagreement.[Stripe’s recipient service\nagreement](https://stripe.com/connect-account/legal/recipient)`setPrivacyPolicyUrl``string`Absolute\nURL to your privacy policy.[Stripe’s privacy\npolicy](https://stripe.com/privacy)`setSkipTermsOfServiceCollection``string`If\ntrue, embedded onboarding skips terms of service collection and you must\n[collect terms acceptance\nyourself](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/updating-service-agreements#indicating-acceptance).false`setCollectionOptions``{\nfields: 'currently_due' | 'eventually_due', future_requirements: 'omit' |\n'include' }`Customizes collecting `currently_due` or `eventually_due`\nrequirements and controls whether to include [future\nrequirements](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-future_requirements).\nSpecifying `eventually_due` collects both `eventually_due` and `currently_due`\nrequirements.`{fields: 'currently_due', futureRequirements:\n'omit'}``setOnExit``() => void`The connected account has exited the onboarding\nprocess`setOnStepChange``({step}: StepChange) => void`The connected account has\nnavigated from one step to another within the onboarding process.

You can\nprefill information on the account object in this API call.\n- [Initialize Connect embedded\ncomponents](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components#account-sessions)\nusing the ID of the connected account.\n- Include the `account-onboarding` element to show the onboarding flow to the\nconnected account.\n- Listen for the `exit` event emitted from this component. Stripe sends this\nevent when the connected account exits the onboarding process.\n- When `exit` triggers, retrieve account details to check the status of\n[details_submitted](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-details_submitted),\n[charges_enabled](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-charges_enabled),\n[payouts_enabled](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-payouts_enabled),\nand other capabilities. If all required capabilities are enabled, you can take\nthe account to the next step of your flow.\n\n#### The `stepchange` object\n\nEvery time the connected account navigates from one step to another in the\nonboarding process, a `stepchange` object is passed to the step change handler\nwith the following properties.\n\nNameTypeExample value`step``string` See the [possible step\nvalues](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/supported-embedded-components/account-onboarding#step-values)`business_type`The\nunique reference to an onboarding step.\n##### Restrictions\n\n- The `stepchange` object is only for analytics.\n- Steps can appear in any order and can be repeated.\n- Possible `step` values can change at any time.\n\n#### Step Values\n\nEach page in onboarding has a unique step name. This `step` is an exhaustive\nlist of pages the user could see in the onboarding process. These values can\nchange at any time without notice.\n\nStepsDescription`stripe_user_authentication`[User\nauthentication](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components#user-authentication-in-connect-embedded-components)\nincludes a popup to a Stripe-owned window.
