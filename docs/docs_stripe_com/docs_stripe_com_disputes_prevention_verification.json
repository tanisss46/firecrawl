The card issuer\nchecks this against the information they have on file for the cardholder. If the\nprovided information doesn’t match, the verification check fails. A failed CVC\nor postal code check can indicate the payment is fraudulent, so review it\ncarefully before fulfilling the order.\n\nEach [Charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api#charge_object) object includes the\n[verification\nresponse](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_charge-verification-responses) as\npart of its `source` attribute. You can also find the verification results in\nthe [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payments) when viewing a\npayment.\n\nIf no information is collected, the card issuer can’t perform a verification\ncheck. Collect the CVC, postal code, and billing address for every payment to\navoid this issue. The results of verification checks help improve the detection\nof fraudulent activity.\n\n## Card verification code check (CVC)\n\nThe CVC (or CVV) is the three- or four-digit number printed directly on a card\nthat only cardholders in physical possession of the card should have access to.\nWhen you require the CVC value with a card payment method (during payment or\nwhen attaching the payment method to a customer’s profile), the card issuer\nverifies the value during transaction authorization.\n\n[Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) allows you to block payments that fail\nthe card issuer verification in various situations by enabling a\n[rule](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules#built-in-rules) through the\n[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/radar/rules). This doesn’t affect\npayments where the CVC check couldn’t be performed or is unavailable. For\nexample, [wallets](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods) like Apple\nPay or off-session payments don’t require it.\n\nBusinesses can’t store the CVC number, so fraudsters are unlikely to obtain the\nCVC through a computer breach, making CVC verification an effective fraud\nprevention tool. However, CVC verification doesn’t protect against the physical\ntheft of a card, nor computers or websites with poor security.\n\n## Address verification (AVS)\n\nWhen you require the postal code and the billing street address with a card\npayment method (during payment or when attaching the payment method to a\ncustomer’s profile), the card issuer performs an AVS check to verify that they\nmatch the billing address on file.\n\n[Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) allows you to block payments that fail\nthe postal code (AVS) verification in various situations by enabling a\n[rule](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules#built-in-rules) in the\n[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/radar/rules). AVS checks can fail\nfor legitimate payments. For example, a customer who enters their address\nincorrectly or moves without notifying their card issuer might see payments\nwhere the address check fails.\n\nSupport for AVS checks varies by country and card issuer. For example, certain\ncountries don’t use a postal code, and some card issuers don’t support street\naddress verification. Most cards issued in the United States, Canada, and the\nUnited Kingdom support street address verification.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Best Practices for Preventing\nFraud](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/best-practices)\n- [Types of Fraud](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/fraud-types)\n- [Identifying\nFraud](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/identifying-fraud)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api#charge_object)\n- [verification\nresponse](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_charge-verification-responses)\n- [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payments)\n- [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar)\n- [rule](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules#built-in-rules)\n- [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/radar/rules)\n- [wallets](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods)\n- [Best Practices for Preventing\nFraud](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/best-practices)\n- [Types of Fraud](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/fraud-types)\n- [Identifying\nFraud](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/identifying-fraud)",
