You can delete it by clicking **Finish\nsimulation**. Finishing a simulation deletes all objects associated with it,\nincluding the customer and subscription, from the sandbox or test mode. It\ndoesn’t affect live mode.\n\nTo simulate a subscription:\n\n- Open the Dashboard and enable **Test mode**.\n- In the [subscriptions](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/subscriptions) page,\nclick the subscription to test.\n- Click **Run simulation** in the banner at the top of the page.\n#### Customer ineligible for simulation\n\nThe **Run simulation** button might be disabled if the subscription’s customer:\n\n- Is attached to more than three subscriptions, including [scheduled\nsubscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/subscription-schedules)\n- Has a complex profile, with many quotes, invoices or other related objects\n- In the modal, set the date and time to simulate and click **Advance time**.\n\nYou can advance time by any increment, but you can only advance them two\nintervals at a time from the initial frozen time. For example, if you have a\nmonthly subscription, you can only advance the clock up to two months at a time.\n\nWhen the clock is done advancing, the banner updates and displays the clock’s\ncurrent time.\n\nYou can continue to make changes to your simulation and advance the time for\nsimulations like:\n\n- Adding a [customer balance](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance).\n- Making a mid-cycle upgrade.\n- [Adding one-off invoice\nitems](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/subscription#adding-upcoming-invoice-items).\n\nRepeat as many times as you need to satisfy your test case.\n\n## Links\n\n- [subscriptions](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/subscriptions)\n- [scheduled\nsubscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/subscription-schedules)\n- [customer balance](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance)\n- [Adding one-off invoice\nitems](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/subscription#adding-upcoming-invoice-items)",
