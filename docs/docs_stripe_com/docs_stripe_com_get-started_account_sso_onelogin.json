  "content": "# Single sign-on with OneLoginPublic preview\n\n## Learn how to setup single sign-on in the Dashboard with OneLogin.\n\nStripe supports Single Sign-On (SSO), allowing you to manage your team’s access\nand roles through your identity provider (IdP). This means your team can access\nStripe without needing separate passwords. When SSO is configured, users (team\nmembers) are automatically redirected to your IdP for authentication when they\nsign in to Stripe.\n\nYour IdP verifies if they have a valid role assignment to your Stripe accounts\nor [organization](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/orgs/sso), and\ngenerates a SAML assertion used by Stripe to assign the proper roles in the\nStripe Dashboard. When your account requires SSO, you must update team roles\nthrough your Identity Provider (IdP) for security. Changes to a team member’s\nroles only appear in Stripe after they sign in to the Dashboard again using the\nupdated SAML assertion.\n\n## Set up SSO\n\nTo integrate your Stripe account with your IdP, you’ll need to complete three\nsteps:\n\n- [Prove ownership of the\ndomains](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/sso/onelogin#proving-domain-verification)\nthat your team will use to sign in to the Dashboard.\n- [Configure\nOneLogin](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/sso/onelogin#configuring-your-identity-provider)\nto work with Stripe.\n- [Configure\nStripe](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/sso/onelogin#configure-stripe)\nto work with OneLogin.\n[Proving Domain\nOwnership](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/sso/onelogin#proving-domain-verification)\nA domain is the portion of an email address after the `@` symbol (such as\n`kavholm.com`). You must configure SSO for Stripe for each of your business’s\nemail domains. To verify domain ownership:\n\n- Navigate to [User\nauthentication](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/security/authentication)\nin the Stripe Dashboard, and click **+ New domain** to view your account’s\nunique verification code.\n```\n stripe-verification=4242424242424242424242\n\n```\n- Add the verification code as a `TXT` record to your Domain Name System (DNS)\nprovider.\n- Return to the Stripe Dashboard, and click **Save and verify**. Depending on\nyour DNS provider, it can take 24 hours or more to verify your domain.\n- After successful verification, don’t delete the `TXT` record from your DNS\nprovider. If you delete it, you might lose access to the Dashboard because\nStripe frequently checks the DNS records of your domain.\n\n#### Multiple Stripe accounts support\n\nIf you’re configuring SSO for multiple Stripe accounts, you must create an\n[organization](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/orgs) to centrally\nconfigure SSO across all of your accounts. Alternatively, contact [Stripe\nsupport](https://support.stripe.com/) to verify your domain across separate\naccounts with one shared verification code.\n\n[Configuring\nOneLogin](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/sso/onelogin#configuring-your-identity-provider)\n#### Caution\n\nThere isn’t an official Stripe SAML connector in OneLogin yet. The only\navailable Stripe app is for password-based authentication. Don’t use the\npassword-based authentication for SAML.\n\n- Create a new application to represent the relationship between OneLogin and\nthe Stripe Dashboard. To do so, navigate to the **Applications** page, and\nselect **Add App**.\n- Find the **SAML Test Connector (IdP w/ attr w/ sign response)** app.\n- Select **Save**, and navigate to the **Configuration** section. Then, enter\nthe following values:- **Audience**:\n`https://dashboard.stripe.com/saml/metadata`\n- **Recipient**: `https://dashboard.stripe.com/login/saml/consume`\n- **Consumer URL Validator**: `https://dashboard.stripe.com/login/saml/consume`\n- **Consumer URL**: `https://dashboard.stripe.com/login/saml/consume`\n- Select **SSO** on the side panel, and set the **Signature Algorithm** to\n`SHA-256`.\n- Save your configuration changes by selecting **Save**.\n\n### Assign roles to your team\n\nTo authenticate a team member to Stripe and assign them roles, configure\nOneLogin to send the roles in the SAML assertions.\n\n- Navigate to the **Parameters** section, and create a new **Field**- Set the\n**Field name** to ` Stripe-Role- `. This identifies which account you sign in\nto.\n- Select **Include in SAML assertion**.\n- In the next form, select the [Dashboard\nrole](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/teams/roles) you want your\nusers to have by default. Select **Macro**, and input the desired default role\nin the field below\n\n!\n\nStripe supports the following roles. Some of these roles are only available if\nyour account uses the applicable Stripe product. For more information, see [User\nroles supported by\nStripe](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/teams/roles).\n\nRoleValueAdministrator`admin`Analyst`analyst`Cardholder`cardholder`Connect\nOnboarding Analyst`connect_onboarding_analyst`Connect Risk\nAnalyst`connect_risk_analyst`Data Migration\nSpecialist`data_migration_specialist`Developer`developer`Dispute\nAnalyst`dispute_analyst`Financial Connections\nSpecialist`financial_connections_specialist`IAM Admin`iam_admin`Identity\nAnalyst`identity_analyst`Identity View only`identity_view_only`Issuing Support\nAgent`issuing_support_agent`Opal View only`opal_view_only`Sandbox\nAdministrator`sandbox_admin`Sandbox User`sandbox_user`Super\nAdministrator`super_admin`Support Associate`support_associate`Support\nCommunications`support_communications`Support only`support_only`Support\nSpecialist`support_specialist`Refund Analyst`refund_analyst`Tax\nAnalyst`tax_analyst`Terminal Specialist`terminal_specialist`Topups\nonly`topups_only`Top-up Specialist`topup_specialist`Transfer\nAnalyst`transfer_analyst`View only`view_only`\n#### Support for multiple Stripe accounts\n\nRepeat the previous step and add a **parameter** for each additional Stripe\naccount. Select **Add parameter**, use the current account’s token for the\n**Field name** and choose the role you want your users to have by default.\n\nThe list of account tokens can be found in the **Accounts** section of your\n[Profile](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/user).\n\n!\n\n- Navigate to the **Users** tab. Here, you can assign team members to your\napplication. You can also configure which Roles a user obtains upon log in.\n- Select the **User** you want to edit. Then, navigate to **Applications** on\nthe side panel.\n- In the next modal that opens, you can configure the roles that a user obtains\nwhen they log in. To use multiple roles, add a semicolon after each role. In the\nfollowing example, the user obtains the `analyst` and the `developer` role when\nthey sign in.\n\n!\n\n[Configuring\nStripe](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/sso/onelogin#configure-stripe)\n### Enter values from your identity provider\n\nNext, configure your Stripe account to connect to your identity provider from\nthe [User\nauthentication](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/user_authentication) page.\n\nTo configure Stripe to connect to your identity provider you need:\n\n- **Issuer ID**: An identifier of your identity provider.\n- **Identity provider URL**: The URL of your identity provider that your team\nmembers are redirected to, so they can authenticate.\n- **Identity provider certificate**: The X.509 certificate that your identity\nprovider signs assertions with.\n\n### How to find these values in your identity provider\n\nIn OneLogin, you can find these values by navigating to the **SSO** tab of [your\napplication](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/sso/onelogin#configuring_your_identity_provider).\n\nName of property in StripeName of property in OneLoginIssuer IDIssuer\nURLIdentity provider URLSAML 2.0 Endpoint (HTTP)Identity provider\ncertificateX.509 certificate (click View Details)\n\n!\n\n#### Test your configuration\n\nBefore saving your settings, a test runs to validate your SSO integration. After\nyou click the **Test** button, a window opens in your browser that redirects to\nyour identity provider to sign in. After you sign in, the window automatically\ncloses and test results display on the original page.\n\nIf the test succeeds, you can save the settings, and select an enforcement mode.\nIf the test fails, modify your configuration to address the issues reported and\ntest the integration again.\n\n#### Select an enforcement mode for SSO\n\nWhen using SSO, there are three separate enforcement modes that you can choose\nfrom. These affect which methods of authentication your team members can use.\n\nModeSSO authentication allowedRegular authentication\nallowedOffNoYesOptionalYesYesRequired[Authenticate with\nSSO](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/sso/onelogin#authenticate-sso)\nAfter you finish configuring SSO, you can inform your users to sign in with any\nof these methods:\n\n### Stripe’s sign in page\n\nUsers can navigate to the [Stripe sign in\npage](https://dashboard.stripe.com/login), enter their email, then select **Use\nsingle sign-on (SSO)**.\n\nIf a user has access to multiple accounts, Stripe authenticates them with the\ndefault account connected to the user. If a user only has access to SAML\nmerchants, or doesn’t have access to any merchants, Stripe redirects them to the\nIdP, regardless of the contents in the password field.\n\n### IdP-initiated login\n\nTo use IdP-initiated login, your [IdP needs to support Service\nProvider-initiated\nlogin](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/sso/troubleshooting). Verify\nif this is possible using your IdP’s documentation.\n\n### SSO URL\n\nUse the following login URL with your domain to directly sign in to your account\nwith SSO. This URL includes the domain and account you want to use for SSO\nauthentication. If you change the account token at the end of the URL, it\nauthenticates you against a different account.\n\n```\n\nhttps://dashboard.stripe.com/login/saml_direct/domain/{{YOUR_DOMAIN}}/merchant/{{STRIPE_ACCOUNT_ID}}\n\n```\n\n#### Support for multiple Stripe accounts\n\nIf you’re configuring SSO for multiple Stripe accounts, first create an\n[organization](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/orgs) to centrally\nconfigure SSO across all of your accounts. You can change the account token at\nthe end of the SSO URL to authenticate against another account. You can find the\nlist of account tokens in the **Accounts** section of your\n[Profile](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/user).\n\n**Multiple IdP connections:** If you have multiple Stripe businesses with\nmultiple IdP settings (for example, different SAML endpoints or issuer IDs) but\nshare the same domain, we recommend using login URLs.\n\n## Revoke team member access\n\nYou can revoke a team member’s access using either active or passive methods.\n\n### Actively revoke access with an assertion\n\nSend Stripe an assertion from your identity provider to grant a team member\naccess to specific Stripe accounts. This also lets you revoke a team member’s\naccess. To revoke access for a team member, assign them a role of `none` for the\nStripe account’s access you want to revoke. For example:\n\n```\n<saml2:attribute name=\"Stripe-Role-STRIPE-ACCOUNT-ID\"\nNameFormat=\"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:basic\">\n <saml2:attributevalue>none\n </saml2:attributevalue>\n</saml2:attribute>\n```\n\n#### Caution\n\nYou can’t revoke access for the owner of a Stripe account.\n\n### Passively revoke access with enforcement mode\n\nWhen **enforcement mode** is set to **required**, only team members who can\nauthenticate with your identity provider can access your Stripe account. In\n**required** mode, you can revoke a team member’s access to a Stripe account by\npreventing your identity provider from authenticating them. In the Stripe\nDashboard, set SSO to **required** in [User\nauthentication](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/user_authentication).\n\n## Links\n\n- [organization](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/orgs/sso)\n- [User\nauthentication](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/security/authentication)\n- [organization](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/orgs)\n- [Stripe support](https://support.stripe.com/)\n- [Dashboard role](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/teams/roles)\n- [Profile](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/user)\n- [User\nauthentication](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/user_authentication)\n- [Stripe sign in page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/login)\n- [IdP needs to support Service Provider-initiated\nlogin](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/sso/troubleshooting)",
