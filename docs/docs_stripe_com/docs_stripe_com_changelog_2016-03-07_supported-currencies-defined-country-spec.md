# Supported currencies are defined on the country spec for an account's countryBreaking changes

## What’s new

Removes the `currencies_supported` property from the `Account` object. You can
find a list of supported currencies by retrieving a `Country Spec` object for
the country of the account.

## Impact

Streamlines the `Account` object by removing the `currencies_supported`
property, simplifying data management. You now need to retrieve currency
information from the `Country Spec` object specific to the account’s country.
