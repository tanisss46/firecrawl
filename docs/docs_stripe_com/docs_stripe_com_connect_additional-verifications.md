# Additional verifications

## Add identity verification checks to your platform’s connected accounts.

Collect additional identity verification from connected
[accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/accounts) to help reduce fraud
losses, streamline risk operations, and meet additional compliance requirements.
Automatically collect required information with [Connect
Onboarding](https://stripe.com/connect/onboarding) or embed [Stripe
Identity](https://docs.stripe.com/identity) as part of your custom onboarding
experience. Restrict your flow of funds based on verification status and volume
thresholds.

By adding a few lines of code to your [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)
integration, you can:

- Request an ID document check during initial onboarding
- Match the ID photo with selfies of the document holder
- Disable [payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts) or payments based on
verification status or volume thresholds
- Access captured images and data extracted from ID documents
- Receive detailed status updates and error messages

Common use cases for additional verifications

- **Reduce fraud losses**: For example, platforms can streamline risk processes
by requiring an ID verification before enabling the first payout.
- **Increase trust & safety**: For example, marketplaces facilitating in-person
services can require ID verification before allowing connected accounts to
collect payments or interact with other users.
- **Meet additional compliance requirements**: For example, platforms can
conduct ID verification to confirm the user’s identity to help meet their own
KYC requirements.
