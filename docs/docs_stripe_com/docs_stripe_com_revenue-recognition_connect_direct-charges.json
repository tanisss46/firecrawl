To add an application fee on a [direct\ncharge](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges), pass an optional\n`application_fee_amount` value. Stripe recognizes the revenue immediately.\n\nIn this example, the `application_fee_amount=\"200\"` is set on the direct charge.\n\n- On January 15, you make a direct charge of 10 USD with a 2 USD application\nfee.- The 2 USD application fee transfers to your platform.\n- 8 USD is netted in the connected account.\nAccountJanRevenue+2.00Cash+2.00\n## Contra revenue with issuing refunds\n\nTo refund an application fee, pass a `refund_application_fee` value of `true` in\nthe refund request or provide a `refund_application_fee` value of `false` to\nrefund the application fee separately through the API. In both cases, Stripe\nbooks the refunded application fee as contra revenue.\n\nIn this example, the `application_fee_amount=\"200\"` is set on the charge.\n\n- On January 15, you make a direct charge of 10 USD with a 2 USD application\nfee.- The 2 USD application fee transfers to your platform.\n- 8 USD is netted in the connected account.\n- On February 21, Stripe refunds the full charge amount of 10 USD and the full\napplication fee amount of 2 USD.\nAccountJanFebRevenue+2.00Cash+2.00-2.00Refunds+2.00\n\n## Links\n\n- [direct charge](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges)",
