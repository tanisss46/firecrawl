To see what fees we\ncharged, read the [fees\nreport](https://dashboard.stripe.com/balance?type=stripe_fee), which Stripe\nupdates daily. Some fees for line items might take a few days to appear in the\nreport. Learn more about [Revenue Recognition\npricing](https://stripe.com/revenue-recognition#pricing).\n\nThe following table explains Revenue Recognition fees.\n\nSituationRevenue Recognition fees chargedSuccessful transactionsStripe applies\nthe fee only when a payment succeeds (for example, when an invoice is paid or\nwhen a one-time payment is made).Transactions processed by StripeStripe\ncalculates the fee based on the volume processed, rather than the volume\nrecognized. If a user paid 120 USD for an annual subscription on December 1,\nStripe calculates the fee based on the 120 USD volume in December, rather than\nthe 10 USD recognized in December.Refunded transactionsIf you refund the\ncorresponding payment, Stripe won’t refund the Revenue Recognition fee.Excluded\ntransactionsStripe charges a fee for all transactions we process, which means\nyou incur a fee even if you exclude a transaction from Revenue Recognition using\n[custom rules](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/rules). The\ntransaction still counts toward your volume because Stripe successfully\nprocessed the transaction.Voided transactionsIf you void an invoice, it won’t\nappear in your monthly volume and Stripe won’t charge the Revenue Recognition\nfee.\n## Fees for multiple settlement currencies\n\nEach currency has an [equivalent\nthreshold](https://stripe.com/revenue-recognition#pricing). If you have multiple\nsettlement currencies, the combined percentage of thresholds met determines the\nfinal fee tier. For each currency, Stripe computes the percentage of volume to\nthe currency’s volume threshold. We call this *percentage-to-threshold volume*.\nIf the total percentage-to-threshold-volume is more than 100, you qualify for a\nlower-priced tier.\n\nTo demonstrate, see the following two example scenarios.\n\n#### Scenario 1\n\nThe total percentage-to-threshold-volume is 82%, which means you don’t qualify\nfor the discount.\n\nCurrencyMerchant volumeThreshold volumePercentage-to-threshold\nvolumeUSD80,000100,00080%GBP1,00050,0002\n#### Scenario 2\n\nThe total percentage-to-threshold-volume is 120%, which means you qualify for\nthe discount.\n\nCurrencyMerchant volumeThreshold volumePercentage-to-threshold\nvolumeUSD80,000100,00080%GBP20,00050,00040\n## Features without fees\n\nStripe doesn’t charge fees for:\n\n- [Rules](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/rules)\n- [Reports](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/reports)\n- [Accounting period\ncontrols](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/revenue-settings/accounting-period-control)\n- [Data export](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/api)\n\n## Links\n\n- [fees report](https://dashboard.stripe.com/balance?type=stripe_fee)\n- [Revenue Recognition pricing](https://stripe.com/revenue-recognition#pricing)\n- [custom rules](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/rules)\n- [Reports](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/reports)\n- [Accounting period\ncontrols](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/revenue-settings/accounting-period-control)\n- [Data export](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/api)",
