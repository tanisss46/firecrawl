You\ncan change this to a custom domain.\n\n## Set up a custom email domain\n\nTo start sending emails from your own domain, complete the following steps:\n\n- [Add your\ndomain](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/email-domain#adding_domain)\nin the Dashboard.\n- [Verify your\ndomain](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/email-domain#verifying_domain)\nto allow sending.\n- [Set your sending\ndomain](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/email-domain#setting_sending_domain)\nas your domain.\n\nTo modify the look and feel of your emails, go to your\n[Branding](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/branding) settings.\n\n[Add your\ndomain](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/email-domain#adding_domain)\nNavigate to your [Customer email](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/emails)\nsettings and add the domain that you want to send customer emails from.\n\n[Verify your\ndomain](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/email-domain#verifying_domain)\nTo verify your domain, you must configure the Domain Name System (DNS) records\nprovided in the Dashboard. These DNS records are necessary to verify your domain\nownership and reliable email delivery.\n\nThe procedure for adding DNS records to the DNS server for your domain depends\non who provides your DNS service. Consult the documentation for your DNS service\nfor specific instructions.\n\n### Instructions for popular providers\n\nIt can take up to 72 hours for DNS record changes to be confirmed. Stripe lets\nyou know whether your domain has been verified.\n\n### Troubleshoot DNS issues\n\nIf your domain hasn’t been verified after 72 hours, try the following:\n\n- Correct any typos. You can check your domain records in the Dashboard’s\n[Customer emails](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/emails) settings by\nclicking **Verify domain** to filter issues.\n- Make sure you don’t have any records that share the same name as the provided\nCNAME records. CNAME records must be the [only record\npresent](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2181#section-10.1) for a record name.\n- Make sure the added record names don’t include your domain twice. Some\nproviders automatically append DNS record names with the domain name. For\nexample, to create a record with the name **bounce.example.com**, enter only\n`bounce` in the **Name** field.\n- Check that the DNS records are published. You can verify this by using a [DNS\nlookup tool](https://dnschecker.org/all-dns-records-of-domain.php), which\ndisplays the published records for your domain.\n\nIf you’ve tried all of our troubleshooting recommendations and are still having\ntrouble verifying your domain, contact your DNS provider.\n\n### DNS records\n\nEach category of record that needs to be configured has a purpose.\n\nRecord CategoryTypePurposeStripe proof-of-ownershipTXTBefore you can send email\nfrom a domain, we must confirm ownership of the domain you plan to use.Mail From\nDomainCNAMEThis specifies the source of the message to the receiving email\nserver and the [Sender Policy Framework\n(SPF)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7208) policy to allow sending.[DomainKeys\nIdentified Mail (DKIM)](http://dkim.org/)CNAMEThese allow a mail server to\nverify that a third party didn’t modify a message in transit.\n#### Caution\n\nAfter we verify the domain, don’t delete the provided DNS records from your\ndomain. Stripe frequently checks these records. If a record becomes invalid or\ngoes missing, we notify you. Also, make sure to correct DNS records within 48\nhours. If you don’t, we send customer emails from *stripe.com* until you resolve\nthe problem.\n\n### Sender authentication (DMARC)\n\nTo use a custom email domain, you need to set up a DMARC policy for your domain.\n[Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance\n(DMARC)](https://dmarc.org/) shields your domain from impersonation attacks,\nsuch as phishing. Notably, major email providers like Google and Yahoo now\nnecessitate DMARC for those sending bulk emails.\n\nYou publish DMARC policy as a DNS TXT record. The record’s name is always\n`_dmarc`, and the value comprises tag-value pairs that symbolize your policy.\nAdditionally, you can learn about all the [supported tags and their\nuses](https://dmarc.org/overview/), but let’s cover some of the most significant\ntags:\n\nTagDescriptionSample valuev requiredThe protocol version. This must always be\nDMARC1.v=DMARC1p requiredThe policy for domain. The possible values are: none,\nquarantine, reject.p=nonerua optionalAddress(es) to receive aggregate\nreportsrua=mailto:report@example.com\nIf you’re new to DMARC, we suggest beginning with a `p=none` policy for initial\nmonitoring, then switch to either `quarantine` or `reject` in due course. After\nyou’ve settled on the appropriate policy, you must incorporate the following DNS\nrecord into your domain:\n\nTypeNameValueTXT`_dmarc`Your DMARC policy. For example: `v=DMARC1; p=none;\nrua=mailto:report@example.com`\n#### Caution\n\nWe don’t currently support strict SPF alignment. Make sure your DMARC policy\ndoesn’t have `aspf=s`.\n\nIf you’re already using this domain to send email, use caution when adding DMARC\nto make sure that it doesn’t interfere with your existing configuration. Consult\nan email or IT professional before adding or modifying this record.\n\n[Set your sending\ndomain](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/email-domain#setting_sending_domain)\nIf Stripe has verified your domain, you’ll see a **Verified** badge under the\n**Verification** column in your [Customer\nemail](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/emails) settings. Customer emails\nare now sent from your domain. You can send a test email by clicking the\noverflow menu ().\n\nWhenever a customer replies to your emails, their responses are sent to the\nsupport email address you specified in your [public business\ninformation](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public).\n\n## Change email domains\n\nWe must verify each domain that you want to set as your sending domain. To\nswitch to a new domain, return to [Add your\ndomain](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/email-domain#setup). You can\nalways switch back to sending your customer emails using `stripe.com`.\n\nWhen you’re no longer using a domain to send customer emails, you can remove it\nfrom your [Customer email](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/emails)\nsettings. In the **Your custom email domains** section, click the overflow menu\n() next to the domain name and select **Remove domain**. After removing the\ndomain from your Dashboard, remove the unused DNS records from your DNS service.\n\n### Instructions for popular providers\n\n## Use the same email domain on multiple Stripe accounts\n\nYou can use the same email domain on multiple Stripe accounts by following the\nsteps described above. To verify the domain, create one TXT record for each\naccount, or if your provider doesn’t support this, create a single TXT record\nwith one account per line.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Branding](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/branding)\n- [Customer email](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/emails)\n- [only record present](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2181#section-10.1)\n- [DNS lookup tool](https://dnschecker.org/all-dns-records-of-domain.php)\n- [Sender Policy Framework (SPF)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7208)\n- [DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM)](http://dkim.org/)\n- [Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance\n(DMARC)](https://dmarc.org/)\n- [supported tags and their uses](https://dmarc.org/overview/)\n- [public business information](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public)",
