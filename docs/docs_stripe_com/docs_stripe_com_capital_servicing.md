## Support your Capital customers using Stripe-approved messaging.

Stripe handles all servicing cases and is the first line of support for your
users’ inquiries. In every outreach we send to users, we include a support email
([capital+support@stripe.com](mailto:capital+support@stripe.com)) they can
contact if they have questions. All Stripe interfaces also include this support
email.

The servicing functions that Stripe handles include:

- Reviewing applications
- Collecting payments
- Maintaining records of payments and balances
- General administration of the financing
- Responding to any borrower inquiries
- Following up on any delinquencies

If your support team chooses to field basic, frontline user inquiries, we offer
pre-approved, compliant training materials and templates to create public
support references. Refer to the [approved support

[Pre-approved FAQ](https://docs.stripe.com/capital/servicing#pre-approved-faq)
Use the following pre-approved copy for FAQs hosted on your website or your user
dashboard.

**How do you determine who qualifies for an offer?**

Eligibility is determined based on a combination of factors, including overall
sales volume and history with [Brand Name]. Eligible US businesses will receive
an email [and Dashboard notification] if they have an offer available.

**Do I have to pay interest?**

No, you’ll pay one flat fee that does not change. You won’t pay any interest on
top of this fee.

**Will applying for an offer affect my personal credit rating?**

No, there is no personal credit check. All offers are based on your history with
[brand name].

**Can I request a different offer amount?**

When you log into your [brand name] Dashboard, you can use a slider to choose a
custom amount (up to the maximum offer amount). The loan fee and repayment rate
adjust based on the amount you choose.

**When do I need to pay the flat fee?**

You’ll automatically pay the flat fee through a percentage of your sales until
the total amount owed is repaid. The fee isn’t charged up-front.

**How does repayment work?**

Repayment is collected automatically through a percentage of your [brand name +
payment] sales as they’re processed which means you pay down more when business
is busy and less if things slow down. As long as you meet your minimum payment
requirement, what you pay each day adjusts to your sales.

**What is a minimum payment?**

A minimum payment is the minimum amount that you’re expected to repay every
repayment period. That period will be determined during underwriting and based
on the total term of your loan offer. If your automatic repayments do not meet
this minimum, you’ll be required to pay the remaining amount at the end of the
period. You can view your minimum payment amount in the Dashboard or in your
loan agreement.

**How do I make my minimum payment?**

If your payments deducted from sales cover the minimum payment requirement for
payment period, no action will be taken. If you have not met the minimum payment
amount by the end of the payment period, Stripe will automatically debit your
bank account or account balance the balance needed to meet your minimum payment.
There’s no action needed on your part.

**After I accept an offer, how quickly will I get my funds?**

If your application is approved, you’ll see the funds in your bank account
typically in as soon as 2 business days. To make sure that funds are disbursed
successfully, you must set a valid bank account as your primary payout method.

**Can I have my Capital funds paid out to a card?**

We currently don’t support disbursal of funds to a card. To make sure that funds
are disbursed successfully, you must set a valid bank account as your primary
payout method.

**What happens when my offer expires?**

Each offer is available for 30 days. After that point, your business will
automatically be re-evaluated to see if you’re eligible for an additional offer.

**Can I repay my loan early?**

Yes, you can make additional payments or pay the total amount owed in full at
any point by clicking the ‘Make Payment’ button in your Dashboard. There are no
additional fees for early repayment.

**Will repaying early qualify me for a new offer?**

Once you repay the total amount owed, you’ll automatically be evaluated for a
new offer. Repaying early does not automatically qualify you for a new offer.

**How should I report these funds on my taxes?**

Tax reporting is often dependent on your specific situation, so we encourage you
to talk with a tax advisor to ensure appropriate accounting. In general, Stripe
Capital funds would not be considered taxable income at the time of receipt, and
the amounts withheld to satisfy your obligations are not tax deductible.

**Who can I contact to learn more about the Stripe Capital program?**

If you have additional questions about how our financing program through Stripe
Capital works, you can contact our partners at
[capital+support@stripe.com](mailto:capital+support@stripe.com).

[Pre-approved user support article
template](https://docs.stripe.com/capital/servicing#support-article-template)
Use the following pre-approved copy for a support article about Stripe Capital
that can be hosted on your website. This template uses a stand-in platform name
“Rocket Rides”, which you can replace with your platform name.

### Stripe Capital

Rocket Rides has partnered with Stripe to offer eligible businesses access to
fast, flexible financing through the Stripe Capital program.

### Eligibility

Rocket Rides businesses are automatically reviewed for eligibility on a daily
basis, and we’ll send you an email if your business qualifies for an offer. The
criteria for eligibility is based on a number of factors including your
transaction volume and history with Rocket Rides.

Eligible US businesses will receive an email if they have an offer to apply for
available.

### Offer structure

If eligible, you’ll receive an email with your personalized offers and you can
choose the one that works best for your business. Each offer will outline:

- The financing amount: the dollar amount that will be deposited into your bank
account
- The flat fee: the fee you’ll pay over time in exchange for the financing
amount – there are no other fees and or compounding interest
- The total amount owed: the sum of the financing amount and the flat fee
- The repayment rate: the percentage of your daily card transactions processed
through Rocket Rides that will be withheld to repay the total amount owed.

Here’s an example offer you might receive:

- financing amount: 17,000 USD
- flat fee: 1700 USD
- total amount owed: 18,700 USD
- repayment rate: 12

If you accepted the example offer above and were approved, you would receive
17,000 USD in the bank account associated with your Rocket Rides account within
1-2 days along with your usual payout. Stripe would then withhold 12% of your
daily transaction total in addition to the usual processing fees until you’ve
paid down the total amount owed of 18,700 USD (the 17,000 USD advanced plus the
1,700 USD flat fee).

### Repayment

You’ll automatically repay the financing over time through a percentage of your
transactions according to your repayment rate. The repayment process will begin
automatically 1-2 business days after the funds have been deposited into your
account. The more card sales you process through Rocket Rides Payments, the
faster you’ll repay.

If you would prefer to repay faster or repay the entire outstanding balance, you
can arrange to make a manual payment in addition to the withheld amounts by
clicking the ‘Make Payment’ button in your loan overview page. There are no
additional fees for early repayment.

Repaying early doesn’t guarantee subsequent financing offers. Accounts are
automatically reviewed for additional offers on a daily basis and we’ll send you
an email if you qualify for any additional offers.

You’re expected to repay a minimum amount every repayment period. That period
will be determined during underwriting and based on the total term of your loan
offer. If the total payments deducted from your sales cover the minimum payment
requirement, then you’ll continue to pay back your loan through a percentage of
your transactions.

However, if payments deducted from your sales over that period happen to fall
below the minimum payment requirement, you’ll be required to pay the remaining
amount. Stripe automatically debits your bank account or account balance for the
balance needed to meet your minimum payment. You can view your minimum payment
amount in the Dashboard or in your loan agreement.

To see a daily summary of your repayment progress, see the loan overview page.
