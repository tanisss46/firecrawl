  "content": "# Identity verification for connected accounts\n\n## Use identity verification to reduce risk on your platform when using Connect.\n\nEvery country has its own requirements that accounts must meet so that Stripe\ncan pay out funds to individuals and companies. These are typically known as\n[Know Your\nCustomer](https://support.stripe.com/questions/know-your-customer-obligations)\n(KYC) requirements. Regardless of the country, broadly speaking, the\nrequirements Stripe must meet are:\n\n- Collecting information about the individual or company receiving funds\n- Verifying information to establish that we know who our customers are\n\n[Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect) platforms collect the required\ninformation from users and provide it to Stripe. This can include information\nabout the legal entity and personal information about the representative of the\nbusiness, and those who own or control the business. Stripe then attempts\nverification. In some cases, Stripe might be able to verify an account by\nconfirming some or all of the keyed-in data provided. In other cases, Stripe\nmight require additional information, including, for example, a scan of a valid\ngovernment-issued ID, a proof of address document, or both.\n\nThis page explains the verification flow options to meet Stripe KYC\nrequirements, but the recommended way to manage verification is to integrate\n[Connect Onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding),\nwhich lets Stripe take care of the complexity around the basic KYC obligations.\nHandling the details of account verification is initially complex and requires\nvigilance to keep up with the constantly evolving regulatory changes around the\nworld.\n\nIf you decide to handle account verification yourself, continue reading to learn\nabout the verification flow options, how API fields translate to companies and\nindividuals, and how to localize information requests. Also, read [Handling\nIdentity Verification with the\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/handling-api-verification) to learn how to\nprogrammatically provide information and handle requests.\n\nEven after Stripe verifies a connected account, platforms still must [monitor\nfor and prevent\nfraud](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/risk-management/best-practices#fraud).\nDon’t rely on Stripe’s verification to meet any independent legal KYC or\nverification requirements.\n\n## Verification requirements\n\nVerification requirements for connected accounts vary by account, depending on:\n\n- Country\n- Capabilities\n- Business type (for example, individual, company)\n- Business structure (for example, public corporation, private partnership)\n- The service agreement type between Stripe and the connected account\n- The risk level\n\nYou must collect and verify specific information to enable charges and\n[payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts). For example, for a company in the\nUS, you might need to collect:\n\n- Information about the business (for example, name, address, tax ID number).\n- Information about the person opening the Stripe account (for example, name,\ndate of birth).\n- Information about [beneficial\nowners](https://support.stripe.com/questions/beneficial-owner-and-director-definitions)\n(for example, name, email).\n\nAt certain variable thresholds—usually when a specified amount of time has\npassed or volume of charges have been made—you might need to collect and verify\nadditional information. Stripe temporarily pauses charges or payouts if the\ninformation isn’t provided or verified according to the thresholds for [required\ninformation](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\nFor example, additional information might include verification of the company\ntax ID number.\n\n## Onboarding flows\n\nAs the platform, you must decide if you want to collect the required information\nfrom your connected accounts upfront or incrementally. Upfront onboarding\ncollects the `eventually_due` requirements for the account, while incremental\nonboarding only collects the `currently_due` requirements.\n\nUpfront onboarding Incremental onboarding Advantages- Entails a single request\nfor information (normally)\n- Creates fewer problems in receiving payouts and maintaining processing ability\n- Exposes potential fraudsters or connected accounts who refuse to provide\nrequired information later\n- Onboards connected accounts quickly\n- Results in higher onboarding rates\nDisadvantages- Onboarding connected accounts can take longer\n- Some legitimate new connected accounts might turn away due to the amount of\ninformation required before they complete the onboarding process\n- Creates a higher likelihood of disrupting business of an ongoing connected\naccount\n\nTo determine whether to use upfront or incremental onboarding, review the\n[required\ninformation](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information)\nfor the countries where your connected accounts are located to understand the\nrequirements that are eventually due. While Stripe tries to minimize any impact\nto connected accounts, requirements might change over time.\n\nFor connected accounts where you’re responsible for requirement collection, you\ncan customize the behavior of [future\nrequirements](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/handle-verification-updates) using\nthe `collection_options` parameter. Set\n[collection_options.future_requirements](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links/create#create_account_link-collection_options-future_requirements)\nto `include` to collect the account’s future requirements.\n\n## Business type\n\nThe specific KYC information depends on the [type of business\nentity](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-business_type).\nthey’re:\n\n- `individual`: Collect information about the person.\n- `company`: Collect information about the company. Depending on the countries\nyour connected accounts are in, you might also have to collect information about\n[beneficial\nowners](https://support.stripe.com/questions/beneficial-owner-and-director-definitions).\n- `non_profit`: Collect information about the non-profit organization.\n- `government_entity` (available for US connected accounts only): Collect\ninformation about the government entity.\n\nIf you or your users are unsure of their entity type, the information might be\nin the business formation documents or tax documents for that entity.\n\nSee the [list of\nrequirements](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information)\nfor different business types by country. When you know what information to\ncollect, you can read more about [handling identity verification with the\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/handling-api-verification).\n\n## Business structure\n\nFor all business types other than `individual`, you can further classify your\nuser’s business by identifying its legal (business) structure. A business\nstructure describes the details of a business entity such as day-to-day\noperations, tax burdens, liability, and organizational schema. You can classify\nit by using\n[company[structure]](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/create#create_account-company-structure)\nin the `Account` object.\n\nProviding this information to Stripe gets you the most accurate business\nclassification for compliance purposes. While it isn’t required, it can reduce\nonboarding requirements. For example, owner information is required for private\ncompanies, but not required for public companies. By default, a `company` is\nconsidered private if information on the `company.structure` isn’t provided.\n\nCountry:Canada (CA)Germany (DE)Singapore (SG)Thailand (TH)United Arab Emirates\n(AE)United States (US)\n### Companies\n\nSee the table below for descriptions of the different business structures that\nyou can use to classify a `company`. Refer to the [US required verification\ninformation](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information#minimum-verification-requirements-for-united-states)\nsection for more details on requirements.\n\nIf you or your users think the entity type should be `company` but are unsure,\nthe information might be in the business formation documents or tax documents\nfor that entity.\n\nBusiness structureDescription`multi_member_llc`A business with multiple owners\nor members that’s registered in a US state as a Limited Liability Company\n(LLC).`private_corporation`A business incorporated in a US state that’s\nprivately owned. It doesn’t have shares that are traded on a public stock\nexchange. It’s also called a closely-held corporation. If you’re a single-member\nLLC that has elected to be treated as a corporation for tax purposes, use this\nclassification.`private_partnership`A business jointly owned by two or more\npeople that’s created through a partnership agreement.`public_corporation`A\nbusiness incorporated under the laws of a US state. Ownership shares of this\ncorporation are traded on a public stock exchange.`public_partnership`A business\nformed by a partnership agreement with one or more people, but has shares that\nare publicly traded on a stock exchange.`single_member_llc`A business entity\nregistered with a US state as a limited liability company (LLC) and that has\nonly one member or owner.`sole_proprietorship`A business that isn’t a separate\nlegal entity from its individual owner.`unincorporated_association`A business\nventure of two or more people that doesn’t have a formal corporate or entity\nstructure.\n### Non-profits\n\nSee the table below for descriptions of the different business structures that\nyou can use to classify a `non_profit` with. Refer to the [US required\nverification\ninformation](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information#minimum-verification-requirements-for-united-states)\nsection for more details on requirements.\n\nBusiness structureDescription`incorporated_non_profit`An organization\nincorporated under the laws of a US state that has obtained tax-exempt status as\na non-profit entity under either state or federal law (for example,\n501(c)(3)).`unincorporated_non_profit`An organization that’s pursuing an\nobjective other than profits, such as a social cause, and has obtained\ntax-exempt status in the US under either state or federal law (for example,\n501(c)(3)) but hasn’t formally incorporated.\n### Government entities\n\nSee the table below for descriptions of the different business structures that\nyou can use to classify a `government_entity` with. Refer to the [US required\nverification\ninformation](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information#minimum-verification-requirements-for-united-states)\nsection for more details on requirements.\n\nBusiness structureDescription`government_instrumentality`An organization formed\nby a government statute or body based in the US to perform a certain function,\nbut not the actual government body itself.`governmental_unit`A branch of the\nstate, local, or federal government of the\nUS`tax_exempt_government_instrumentality`An organization created by or pursuant\nto government statute and operated for public purposes. It has obtained federal\ntax-exempt status under state or federal law (for example, 501(c)(3)).\n## Internationalization and localization\n\nIf you support users in multiple countries, consider internationalization and\nlocalization when asking for information. Creating an interface that uses not\nonly the user’s preferred language but also the proper localized terminology\nresults in a smoother onboarding experience.\n\nFor example, instead of requesting a business tax ID from your users, regardless\nof country, request:\n\n- EIN, US\n- Business Number, Canada\n- Company Number, UK\n\nYou can find recommended country-specific labels along with the other [required\nverification\ninformation](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## See also\n\n- [Stripe-hosted onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/hosted-onboarding)\n- [Updating\nAccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/updating-service-agreements)\n- [Handling additional verifications with the\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/handling-api-verification)\n- [Account tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-tokens)\n- [Required verification\ninformation](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information)\n- [Testing verification](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/testing-verification)\n\n## Links\n\n- [configured with\nproperties](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/update-to-typeless-connect)\n- [Know Your\nCustomer](https://support.stripe.com/questions/know-your-customer-obligations)\n- [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)\n- [Connect Onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding)\n- [Handling Identity Verification with the\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/handling-api-verification)\n- [monitor for and prevent\nfraud](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/risk-management/best-practices#fraud)\n- [payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts)\n- [beneficial\nowners](https://support.stripe.com/questions/beneficial-owner-and-director-definitions)\n- [required\ninformation](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information)\n- [future\nrequirements](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/handle-verification-updates)\n-\n[collection_options.future_requirements](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links/create#create_account_link-collection_options-future_requirements)\n- [type of business\nentity](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-business_type)\n-\n[company[structure]](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/create#create_account-company-structure)\n- [US required verification\ninformation](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information#minimum-verification-requirements-for-united-states)\n- [Stripe-hosted onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/hosted-onboarding)\n- [Updating\nAccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/updating-service-agreements)\n- [Account tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-tokens)\n- [Testing verification](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/testing-verification)",
