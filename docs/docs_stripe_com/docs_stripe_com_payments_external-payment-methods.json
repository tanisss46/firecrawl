Integrating external payment methods requires\nadditional integration work, because external payment method transactions are\nprocessed and finalized outside of Stripe.\n\n#### External payment methods disclaimer\n\nWhen customers choose an external payment method, they’re redirected to a URL\nyou configured for the external payment method. Learn about [what you’re\nresponsible for and the ongoing availability of external payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/external-payment-methods#external-payment-methods-disclaimer).\n\nThis guide adds an external payment method, Divido, using the HTML/JS example\nfrom the [Payment Element\nquickstart](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart).\n\n## Before you begin\n\n- [Create a Stripe account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register) or [sign\nin](https://dashboard.stripe.com/login).\n- Follow the [Payment Element\nquickstart](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart) to complete a payments\nintegration.\n- For each external payment method you want to add, ensure you have completed\nthe integration with each external payment method and confirmed that it is\nworking in the region that you want to enable them in.\n[Add external payment method\ntypes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/external-payment-methods#add-external-payment-method-types)\nIn your `checkout.js` file, where you [initialize Stripe\nElements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart#init-elements), specify\nthe external payment methods you want to add to the Payment Element. This\nexample adds Divido:\n\n```\nelements = stripe.elements({\n clientSecret: clientSecret,\n externalPaymentMethodTypes: ['external_divido']\n });\n```\n\n[Handle payment method selection\nlistener](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/external-payment-methods#handle-external-payment-method-selection)\nThere are two ways to handle the redirect to the external payment method:\n\n- Replace the action of the Stripe **Pay now** button to redirect to the\nexternal payment method.\n- Replace the Stripe **Pay now** button with the external payment method\nprovider’s button.\nReplace actionReplace button\nThis listener replaces the action of the Stripe **Pay now** button to redirect\nthe customer to the Divido checkout page where they can complete the\ntransaction. In `checkout.js`, add the listener code after the\n`paymentElement.mount` call:\n\n```\npaymentElement.mount(\"#payment-element\");\n\n// Track selected payment method\nlet selectedPaymentMethod;\npaymentElement.on('change', (event) => {\n selectedPaymentMethod = event?.value?.type;\n});\n```\n\nUpdate the `handleSubmit` function to redirect to the Divido checkout page:\n\n```\nasync function handleSubmit(e) {\n if (selectedPaymentMethod === 'external_divido') {\n // Redirect customer to the Divido checkout page to complete the transaction\n const dividoRedirectUrl = \"<< fill the Divido redirect URL here >>\";\n window.location.href = dividoRedirectUrl;\n } else {\n ...\n }\n```\n\n[OptionalPosition external payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/external-payment-methods#position-payment-methods)[Test\nyour\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/external-payment-methods#testing)-\nGo through your checkout flow and verify that the Payment Element displays\nDivido. This example configures Divido in the second position after cards.\n\n![Screenshot of what Payment Element looks like when Divido is\nadded](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/display-divido.cbee45d770b63f3938f71ad6682f3ecd.png)\n\nPayment Element with Divido\n- Choose the Divido payment method to verify messaging about the next step\nredirecting to Divido.\n\n![Screenshot of what Payment Element looks like when Divido is\nselected](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/select-divido.f695a72908b8e4b97d37c5bc89e9a2ba.png)\n- Click **Pay now** to test your existing Divido integration. Verify that you\nare redirected to Divido to complete the transaction and any post-payment\nactions (for example, display a confirmation page, success message, or failure\nmessage) still work with your Divido integration.\n\n## Dashboard considerations\n\n[PaymentIntents](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents) for transactions\nprocessed with an external payment method provider have an `incomplete` status\nin the Stripe Dashboard. Stripe isn’t involved in external payment method\ntransactions and can’t determine the status of these transactions.\n\nIf you [collect payment details before creating an\nIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment-deferred), you won’t\nsee any `incomplete` transactions in the Stripe Dashboard for transactions that\nwere processed with an external payment method provider.\n\n## External payment methods disclaimer\n\nYou can use the Stripe Payment Element to show some external payment methods\nthat aren’t supported by Stripe but that you directly integrate with. When\ncustomers choose an external payment method, they’re redirected to a URL that\nyou configure for the external payment method. You acknowledge that:\n\n- External payment methods aren’t offered nor supported by Stripe. The operation\nand support of external payment methods is provided by the external payment\nmethod provider.\n- You’re responsible for maintaining a direct integration with the external\npayment method provider.\n- You need to maintain an agreement with the external payment method provider\nand are responsible for complying with your agreements with each external\npayment method provider.\n- You’re responsible for obtaining all necessary rights to use the external\npayment method provider’s marks and logos within your checkout as described in\nthese docs.\n- Stripe isn’t responsible for the processing of any transactions with any\nexternal payment method provider including, for example, any charges, refunds,\ndisputes, settlements or funds flows.\n- You or the external payment method provider are responsible for the completion\nof the purchase flow after a customer has selected an external payment method,\nincluding, for example, the order confirmation and reconciliation of orders.\n- You’re responsible for properly configuring the redirect URL for the external\npayment method.\n- You must immediately remove any external payment methods in the event your\nagreements with any external payment method provider terminate or Stripe removes\nthe availability of an external payment method.\n- You’re only permitted to integrate with and present in the Payment Element the\nexternal payment methods listed in this guide.\n- You’re solely responsible for making sure that buyers are redirected correctly\nto their chosen external payment method.\n\n### Ongoing availability of external payment methods\n\nStripe might at any time decide to remove the availability of any payment method\nas an external payment method. Stripe will notify you of any removal of an\nexternal payment method that you’re using, and you must immediately remove the\nexternal payment method in your code. Failure to do so will result in the\nexternal payment method not rendering to your customers.\n\n## Available external payment methods\n\nYou can display the following external payment methods. You must use the\ncorresponding external payment method type in your code.\n\nRegionPayment methodExternal payment method\ntypeAMERInterac`external_interac`APACau\nPAY`external_au_pay`APACatone`external_atone`APACTouch’n\nGo`external_tng_ewallet`APACソフトバンクまとめて支払い (Softbank carrier\npayments)`external_softbank_carrier_payment`APACToss\nPay`external_toss_pay`APACLaybuy`external_laybuy`APACBank\nPay`external_bank_pay`APACauかんたん決済 (au easy\npayments)`external_au_easy_payment`APACBitCash`external_bitcash`APACAzupay`external_azupay`APACd払い\n(d-barai)`external_dbarai`APACFamiPay`external_famipay`APACGCash`external_gcash`APACGrabPay\nLater`external_grabpay_later`APACMoMo`external_momo`APACNET\nCASH`external_net_cash`APACOctopus`external_octopus`APACPaidy`external_paidy`APACPayPay`external_paypay`APACPlanPay`external_planpay`APACペイジー\n(Pay-easy)`external_pay_easy`APAC楽天ペイ (Rakuten\nPay)`external_rakuten_pay`APACメルペイ\n(Merpay)`external_merpay`APACWebMoney`external_webmoney`APAC, EuropeShopback\nPay`external_shopback_pay`EuropeAplazame`external_aplazame`EuropeBizum`external_bizum`EuropeDivido`external_divido`EuropeFonix`external_fonix`EuropeIwocapay`external_iwocapay`EuropeKBC`external_kbc`EuropeNexi\nPay`external_nexi_pay`EuropeOney`external_oney`EuropePayconiq`external_payconiq`EuropePayPo`external_paypo`EuropeSofinco`external_sofinco`EuropePostepay`external_postepay`EuropePostFinance`external_postfinance`EuropeScalapay`external_scalapay`EuropeTrueLayer`external_truelayer`EuropeWalley`external_walley`EuropeYounitedPay`external_younited_pay`GlobalLINE\nPay`external_line_pay`Globalpaysafecard`external_paysafecard`GlobalSamsung\nPay`external_samsung_pay`GlobalSezzle`external_sezzle`LATAMDapp`external_dapp`LATAMPicPay`external_picpay`MEATabby`external_tabby`MEABenefit`external_benefit`MEAFawry`external_fawry`\n\n## Links\n\n- [Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element)\n- [Payment Element quickstart](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart)\n- [Create a Stripe account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register)\n- [sign in](https://dashboard.stripe.com/login)\n- [initialize Stripe\nElements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart#init-elements)\n- [PaymentIntents](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents)\n- [collect payment details before creating an\nIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment-deferred)",
