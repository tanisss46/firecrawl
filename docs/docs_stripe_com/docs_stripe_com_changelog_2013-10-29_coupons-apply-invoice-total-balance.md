# Coupons only apply to an invoice's total balance, no longer applying to zero-cost invoicesBreaking changes

## What’s new

Changes coupon behavior so that applying an amount-off coupon to an invoice
doesn’t increase the `Customer` account balance if the discount is greater than
the invoice amount. Coupons are ignored, and not counted as redeemed, when
applied to zero-cost invoices. This change doesn’t apply to coupons created on
an earlier API version.

## Impact

This change to coupon behavior prevents unexpected increases in customer account
balances, and ignores coupons on zero-cost invoices.
