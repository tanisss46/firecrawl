Otherwise, they’re submitted on the\nfollowing business day.

See [Issuing\ntransactions](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/purchases/transactions).\n## Automatic payouts\n\nAll platforms using Treasury have access to standard automatic payouts, which\nmove money from Stripe Payments to a Treasury financial account on a T+2 or\nslower schedule from the time of transaction (T+2 for card payments, slower for\nACH).\n\nYou can request a platform risk review to access faster payouts; upon approval,\nyour platform can use T+1 automatic payouts for connected accounts. T+1 faster\npayout schedules apply to all payment types, including both card payments and\nACH payments, and the timelines start when the transaction occurs (faster\npayouts eliminate the need to wait for standard payments fund settlement times).\n\nTo request access to faster payouts for your platform, email\n[treasury-support@stripe.com](mailto:treasury-support@stripe.com).\n\nFor more details, see the [Automatic payouts\nguide](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/payouts#automatic-payouts).\n\n## Manual payouts\n\nPlatforms using Treasury also have access to standard manual payouts, which move\nfunds in one business day (T+1 schedule) but can only draw on an account’s\n`available` payments balance. In other words, you must wait for funds from a\npayment to settle in the payments balance before initiating a standard manual\npayout to a Treasury financial account.\n\nPlatforms granted access to faster payouts also have access to instant manual\npayouts. Instant manual payouts move funds to a connected account’s financial\naccount within an hour (T+0 schedule) and are available any time, including\nnights, weekends, and holidays. Instant manual payouts are drawn on a connected\naccount’s `instant_available` balance rather than being limited to the\n`available` balance.\n\nFor more details, see the [Manual payouts\nguide](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/payouts#manual-payouts).\n\n## Top-ups\n\nStripe [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect) platform users can top up\ntheir existing Stripe platform account balance using a Stripe Treasury financial\naccount by verifying the routing and account numbers. These funds settle to your\naccount balance according to [Top-ups settlement\ntiming](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/top-ups#settlement-timing).\n\nFor more details, see [Adding funds to your platform\nbalance](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/top-ups).\n\n## Same-day ACH regulations\n\nACH transactions are regulated by\n[Nacha](https://www.nacha.org/content/how-ach-rules-are-made). Consider the\nfollowing when using same-day ACH:\n\n- Individual same-day ACH transactions [can’t exceed 1,000,000\nUSD](https://www.nacha.org/million). If you submit a larger single transaction\nfor same-day processing, Stripe remits the funds for processing on the following\nday.\n- The 1,000,000 USD limit applies only to single transactions. You can submit\nmultiple smaller transactions that total more than 1,000,000 USD for same-day\nprocessing.\n\n#### Note\n\nACH operators monitor for attempts to evade the limit, such as by splitting a\nsingle large transaction into multiple smaller transactions. If they suspect an\nevasion attempt, they process those transactions for next-day settlement in the\nnext available processing window.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Moving money out of financial\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/moving-money-out-of-financial-accounts)\n- [Moving money into financial\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/moving-money-into-financial-accounts)\n- [Payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/payouts)\n\n## Links\n\n-\n[OutboundPayment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/outbound_payments/object#outbound_payment_object-expected_arrival_date)\n-\n[OutboundTransfer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/outbound_transfers/object#outbound_transfer_object-expected_arrival_date)\n- [Issuing transactions](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/purchases/transactions)\n- [Automatic payouts\nguide](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/payouts#automatic-payouts)\n- [Manual payouts\nguide](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/payouts#manual-payouts)\n- [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)\n- [Top-ups settlement\ntiming](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/top-ups#settlement-timing)\n- [Adding funds to your platform\nbalance](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/top-ups)\n- [Nacha](https://www.nacha.org/content/how-ach-rules-are-made)\n- [can’t exceed 1,000,000 USD](https://www.nacha.org/million)\n- [Moving money out of financial\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/moving-money-out-of-financial-accounts)\n- [Moving money into financial\naccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/moving-money-into-financial-accounts)\n- [Payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/treasury/moving-money/payouts)",
