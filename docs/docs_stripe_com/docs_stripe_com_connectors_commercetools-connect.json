The connector translates webhook\nevents between both systems, and supports integration with the [Payment\nElement](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element) and [Express\nCheckout](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/express-checkout-element).\n\n!\n\nCustom checkout composable commerce\n\n## Manage payment methods\n\nYou can enable or disable payment methods from your [payment methods\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) in the Stripe\nDashboard.
