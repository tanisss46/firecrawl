Now, you can use the Payment Element to accept\npayments from one or multiple payment methods. Since this also includes cards,\nyou have the option to integrate the Card Element or the Payment Element to\naccept card payments.\n\nFor most users, the Payment Element is the best option to process cards. The\nintegration effort is the same as the Card Element and it supports all the\ncommon payment flows. It also gives you instant access to additional payment\nmethods, including Google Pay and Apple Pay.
