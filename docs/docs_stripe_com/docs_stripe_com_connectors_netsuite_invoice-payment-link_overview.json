The connector provides the\ninvoice ID and NetSuite customer email. To use this option, enable **Successful\npayments** on the [Customer emails\nsettings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/emails) page in the Stripe\nDashboard. You can also [customize your\nreceipts](https://docs.stripe.com/receipts?payment-ui=payment-links#customizing-receipts).\n- Use NetSuite to send email receipts for payments.

The payment link displays the currency that’s specified on the NetSuite\ninvoice. Stripe then creates a payment based on that currency.\n\nYou can enable the payment methods you want to accept on the [Payment\nmethods](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) page. Stripe\nsupports many categories of [payment\nmethods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/overview) based on\nyour region and business needs.\n\n## Full version\n\nThe free version of the connector with the payment page link doesn’t include\nsyncing payments or other data to NetSuite.\n\nWith the paid, full version of the connector you can:\n\n- Sync all Stripe activity, including payments, invoices, and refunds\n- Automate syncing Stripe payouts as NetSuite deposits\n- Calculate fees and currency conversion\n\nIf you’re interested in learning more about the full [Stripe Connector for\nNetSuite](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/netsuite/overview), [install the\napp](https://marketplace.stripe.com/apps/netsuite-connector) and request a demo.\nYou can also [contact us](mailto:connector-netsuite-sales@stripe.com) to discuss\nhow you use Stripe and NetSuite.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Install the Stripe Connector for NetSuite invoice payment\nlink](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/netsuite/invoice-payment-link/installation)\n- [Invoice payment\npage](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/netsuite/invoice-payment-page)\n-\n[Troubleshooting](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/netsuite/error-resolution)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Stripe\nCheckout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/how-checkout-works)\n- [payment methods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/overview)\n- [Branding settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding)\n- [Public details](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public)\n- [Pay Now\nbutton](https://support.stripe.com/questions/stripe-connector-for-netsuite-pay-now-button)\n- [Customer emails settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/emails)\n- [customize your\nreceipts](https://docs.stripe.com/receipts?payment-ui=payment-links#customizing-receipts)\n- [supported presentment\ncurrencies](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#presentment-currencies)\n- [Payment methods](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods)\n- [Stripe Connector for\nNetSuite](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/netsuite/overview)\n- [install the app](https://marketplace.stripe.com/apps/netsuite-connector)\n- [Install the Stripe Connector for NetSuite invoice payment\nlink](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/netsuite/invoice-payment-link/installation)\n- [Invoice payment\npage](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/netsuite/invoice-payment-page)\n-\n[Troubleshooting](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/netsuite/error-resolution)",
