#### Caution

Stripe automatically presents your customers payment method options by
evaluating their currency, payment method restrictions, and other parameters. We
recommend that you configure your payment methods from the Stripe Dashboard
using the instructions in [Accept a
payment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web&ui=stripe-hosted).

If you want to continue manually configuring the payment methods you present to
your customers with Checkout, use this guide. Otherwise, update your integration
to [configure payment methods in the
Dashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/dashboard-payment-methods).

Mondu is a [single-use](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#usage)
payment method that offers customers payment 30 day net terms. Customers are
redirected from your website or app, authorize the payment with Mondu, then
return to your website or app. You get [immediate
notification](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#payment-notification)
of whether the payment succeeded or failed.

[Determine
compatibility](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/mondu/accept-a-payment#compatibility)
To support Mondu payments, a Checkout Session must satisfy all of the following
conditions:

- [Prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices) for all line items must be in the
same currency.- If you have line items in different currencies, create separate
Checkout Sessions for each currency.

#### Note

Build an integration to [accept a
payment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?integration=checkout)
with Checkout before using this guide.

This guide describes how to enable Mondu and shows the differences between
accepting a card payment and using Mondu.

### Enable Mondu as a payment method

When creating a new [Checkout
Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions), you need to:

- Add ` mondu ` to the list of `payment_method_types`.
- Make sure all `line_items` use the same currency.

```
Stripe::Checkout::Session.create({
 mode: 'payment',
 payment_method_types: ['card'],
 payment_method_types: ['card', 'mondu'],
 line_items: [{
 price_data: {
 currency: 'usd',
 # To accept `mondu`, all line items must have currency: eur
 currency: 'eur',
 product_data: {
 name: 'T-shirt',
 },
 unit_amount: 1000,
 },
 quantity: 1,
 }],
 success_url: 'https://example.com/success',
 cancel_url: 'https://example.com/cancel',
})
```

### Fulfill your orders

After accepting a payment, learn how to [fulfill
orders](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/fulfillment).

[Test your
integration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/mondu/accept-a-payment#test-integration)
When testing your Checkout integration, select Mondu as the payment method and
click the **Pay** button.
