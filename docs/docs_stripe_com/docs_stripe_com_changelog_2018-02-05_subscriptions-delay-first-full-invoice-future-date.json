  "content": "# Subscriptions can now delay the first full invoice to a future date (and optionally include a free trial)Breaking changes\n\n## What’s new\n\nAllows a new subscription’s first full invoice to be on a future date by\nspecifying `billing_cycle_anchor`, with an optional proration up to that date.\n`billing_cycle_anchor` on its own is available retroactively to past versions.\nStarting in this version, you can combine `billing_cycle_anchor` with a trial,\nenabling a free trial to be followed by a prorated period, followed by a fixed\nbilling cycle.\n\n## Impact\n\nLets you set a future date for a new subscription’s first full invoice using\n`billing_cycle_anchor`, with optional prorations. It enables more flexible\nsubscription management by allowing combinations of trials, prorated periods,\nand fixed billing cycles.\n\n## Upgrade\n\n- [View your current API\nversion](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#view-your-api-version-and-the-latest-available-upgrade-in-workbench)\nin Workbench.\n- If you use an SDK, upgrade to the corresponding SDK version for this API\nversion.- If you don’t use an SDK, update your [API\nrequests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/versioning) to include `Stripe-Version:\n2018-02-05`\n- Upgrade the API version used for [webhook\nendpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks/versioning).\n- [Test your integration](https://docs.stripe.com/testing) against the new\nversion.\n- If you use Connect, [test your Connect\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/testing).\n- In Workbench, [perform the\nupgrade](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#perform-the-upgrade).
