With multi-currency settlement, you can configure your\naccount to accrue balances and get paid out in additional currencies without\nincurring foreign exchange fees.\n\n## Enable multi-currency settlement\n\nTo configure your account to receive settlement and pay out in multiple\ncurrencies, configure the currencies and bank accounts in your\n[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/payouts).\n\n![Bank accounts and currencies settings in the\nDashboard](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/bank-accounts-and-currencies-page.cd3a7a8bf6a23667bb5f45f2bf7e19c4.png)\n\n### Configure settlement currencies\n\nIn your Payout Settings, click **Manage Currencies** to select the settlement\ncurrencies you want to receive funds in. Balances accrue in each currency for\npayments you accept in that currency.\n\n### Attach bank accounts to receive payouts in local currencies\n\nYou must provide a separate supported bank account for each settlement currency\nyou configure to receive payouts in that currency. You must match the currency\nof the bank account to the settlement currency.
