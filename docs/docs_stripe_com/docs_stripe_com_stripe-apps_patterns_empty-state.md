# Empty state for Stripe Apps

## Let users know when no data is available to load.

Make it clear to users when there isnâ€™t any data available to load.

## Before you begin

[Create an app](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/create-app).

## Suggested use

- If the user needs to be in a specific place in the Dashboard, link directly to
that page (for example, Customers or Payments). For example:

![Empty state screens for new users of an
app](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/empty-state.50226e2a26e5462dffee81c8b8cb19fb.png)
