# Real-time payments

## Learn about real-time payments with Stripe.

Real-time payment methods let customers directly transfer money from their bank
account or alternate funding source using an authenticating intermediary, like a
phone number. Because this payment method type increases transaction speeds, it
can improve conversion rates. Stripe supports real-time payments in Brazil,
Singapore, Thailand, Sweden, and India.

## Payment process

The real-time payment method process is as follows:

- Stripe sends the customer an identifier that lists the payable amount.
- The customer makes the payment through their application or third-party
service.
- The application or third-party service communicates with the customers bank to
secure the funds.

When a customer uses a real-time payment method, their statement lists the
application or third-party service as the payment type.
