Customers maintain a balance in their wallets that\nthey pay out with.\n\nTo pay with GrabPay, customers are redirected to GrabPay’s website, where they\nhave to authenticate the transaction using a one-time password. After\nauthenticating, customers are redirected back to your website.\n\nPayment method propertiesBusiness locationsProduct support- **Customer\nlocations**\n\nSingapore, Malaysia\n- **Presentment currency**\n\nSGD, MYR\n- **Payment confirmation**\n\nCustomer-initiated\n- **Payment method family**\n\nWallet\n- **Recurring payments**\n\nNo\n- **Payout timing**\n\nStandard payout timing applies\n- **Connect support**\n\nYes\n- **Dispute support**\n\n[No](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/grabpay#disputed-payments)\n- **Manual capture support**\n\nNo\n- **Refunds / Partial refunds**\n\n[Yes / Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/grabpay#refunds)\n\n## Payment flow\n\nBelow is a demonstration of the GrabPay payment flow from your checkout page:\n\n## Get started\n\nYou don’t have to integrate GrabPay and other payment methods individually. If\nyou use our front-end products, Stripe automatically determines the most\nrelevant payment methods to display. Go to the [Stripe\nDashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and enable\nGrabPay. To get started with one of our hosted UIs, follow a quickstart:\n\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart): Our prebuilt, hosted\ncheckout page.\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart): Our drop-in UI\ncomponents.\n\n### Other payment products\n\nThe following Stripe products also let you add GrabPay from the Dashboard:\n\n- [Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/no-code-guide)\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n\nIf your integration requires manually listing payment methods, learn how to\n[manually configure GrabPay as a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/grabpay/accept-a-payment).\n\nCheck out the GrabPay [sample on\nGitHub](https://github.com/stripe-samples/accept-a-payment).\n\n## Refunds\n\nGrabPay payments can be refunded up to 90 days after the original payment.\nRefunds for GrabPay payments are asynchronous and take up to 5 minutes to\ncomplete. We will notify you of the final refund status using the\n`refund.updated` or `refund.failed` [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks)\nevent. When a refund succeeds, the\n[Refund](https://docs.stripe.com/api/refunds/object) object’s status transitions\nto `succeeded`. If a refund fails, the Refund object’s status transitions to\n`failed` and we return the amount to your Stripe balance. You then need to\narrange an alternative way of providing your customer with a refund.\n\n## Disputes\n\nGrabPay payments have a low risk of fraud or unrecognized payments because the\ncustomer must authenticate the payment with Grab. Therefore, there is no dispute\nprocess that can result in a chargeback and funds being withdrawn from your\nStripe account.\n\n## Branding guidelines\n\nUse the [branding\nguidelines](https://d37ugbyn3rpeym.cloudfront.net/docs/files/GrabPay_Online_Partners_Brand_Guidelines.pdf)\nprovided by GrabPay when building your checkout page. Assets such as logos and\nbuttons are available for download [as a zip\nfile](https://d37ugbyn3rpeym.cloudfront.net/docs/files/GrabPay-Branding-Guidelines-with-Logos-and-Artworks.zip).\n\n## Links\n\n- [Grab](https://www.grab.com/sg/pay/)\n- [No](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/grabpay#disputed-payments)\n- [Yes / Yes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/grabpay#refunds)\n- [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods)\n- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart)\n- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart)\n- [Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/no-code-guide)\n- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n- [manually configure GrabPay as a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/grabpay/accept-a-payment)\n- [sample on GitHub](https://github.com/stripe-samples/accept-a-payment)\n- [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks)\n- [Refund](https://docs.stripe.com/api/refunds/object)\n- [branding\nguidelines](https://d37ugbyn3rpeym.cloudfront.net/docs/files/GrabPay_Online_Partners_Brand_Guidelines.pdf)\n- [as a zip\nfile](https://d37ugbyn3rpeym.cloudfront.net/docs/files/GrabPay-Branding-Guidelines-with-Logos-and-Artworks.zip)",
