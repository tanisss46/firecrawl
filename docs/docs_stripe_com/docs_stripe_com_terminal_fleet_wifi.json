We\nsupport the following network security types:\n\n- WPA/WPA2 Personal (PSK)\n- WPA/WPA2 Enterprise (EAP-PEAP)\n- WPA/WPA2 Enterprise (EAP-TLS)\n\nTo fetch the remotely configured network from the server, the reader must first\nconnect to a local WiFi network.\n\nAfter you set the WiFi configuration, it displays as a `Configured network` on\nthe reader. You can then select this network to connect automatically, without\nrequiring the end user to enter any additional information.\n\nIf you update the WiFi profile, Stripe sends these updates to the reader, which\nstays connected to the network as long as the credentials are accurate.\n\n#### Caution\n\nStripe doesn’t perform validation checks when you configure the WiFi profile. If\nyou enter an incorrect password, expired EAP-TLS certificate, or other invalid\ncredentials, the reader won’t connect to the network.\n\nDashboardAPI\nTo configure WiFi settings in the Dashboard:\n\n- Navigate to the [Manage\nlocations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/terminal/locations/) page.\n- Find the specific location you want to change.\n- Click the overflow menu () > **Edit configuration**.\n- Click **Edit** or **Override** next to the **WiFi** icon.\n- Use the **Security** dropdown to select a security type.\n- Enter the relevant credentials.\n- Click **Done**.\n- Click **Apply changes**.\n\nAfter registering to the location, readers display a prompt to connect to the\nconfigured network. For readers that are already registered, the WiFi network\nmight take up to 10 minutes to appear under `Configured networks` in the\nreader’s network settings screen.\n\n## Links\n\n- [BBPOS WisePOS E](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/readers/bbpos-wisepos-e)\n- [Stripe Reader\nS700](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/readers/stripe-reader-s700)\n- [Manage locations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/terminal/locations/)",
