  "content": "# Customers\n\n## Learn how to use the Customer resource with Stripe Billing.\n\nThe [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers) resource is a core entity\nwithin Stripe. Use it to store all of the profile, billing, and tax information\nrequired to bill a customer for\n[subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating) and\none-off [invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices).\n\n## Manage customers\n\nCreate a customer for every new user or business you want to bill. When creating\na new customer, set a [minimum customer\nprofile](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer#minimum-customer-profile) to\nhelp create useful invoices and enable Smart Retries (dunning). After creating\nand configuring this customer, use it to create a subscription and issue one-off\ninvoices.\n\nDashboardAPI\nYou can create and manage customers on the [Customers\npage](https://dashboard.stripe.com/customers) when you don’t want to use code to\ncreate a customer, or if you want to manually bill a customer with a one-off\ninvoice.\n\n#### Note\n\nYou can also create a customer in the Dashboard during invoice creation.\n\n### Create a customer\n\nWhen you create a new customer, you can set their account and billing\ninformation, such as **Email**, **Name**, and **Country**. You can also set a\ncustomer’s preferred language, currency, and other important details.\n\nTo create a customer, complete these steps:\n\n- Verify that the customer doesn’t already exist.\n- Click **Add customer**, or press **N**, on the **Customers** page.\n- At a minimum, enter your customer’s **Name** and **Account email**.\n- Click **Add customer** in the dialog.\n\n### Edit a customer\n\nTo edit a customer’s profile, complete these steps:\n\n- Find the customer you want to modify and click the name on the **Customers**\npage.\n- In the account information page, select **Actions** > **Edit information**.\n- Make your changes to the customer profile.\n- Click **Update customer**.\n\n### Delete a customer\n\nTo delete a customer, complete these steps:\n\n- Find the customer you want to delete on the **Customers** page.\n- Click the checkbox next to your customer’s name followed by **Delete**. You\ncan also click into the customer’s details page and select **Actions** >\n**Delete customer**.\n\n## Available properties and uses\n\nThe Customer resource has many useful properties you can set to customize\nbilling. This section explains the properties you can store on the Customer, and\nthe effects of each.\n\n### Customer profile\n\nA basic customer profile is useful for invoice and receipt generation, and can\ngenerally act as a lightweight customer relationship management system (CRM) for\nyour application. You can also use [Affiliate and referral Stripe\nApps](https://marketplace.stripe.com/categories/affiliate_and_referrals) to set\nup and manage referral and affiliate programs with Stripe, get customer\ninformation, and automate commission adjustments from the Stripe Dashboard.\n\n#### Minimal customer profile\n\nWhen creating a customer, set these properties:\n\n- Email address\n- Customer name\n- Metadata with a reference to the internal customer ID of your application\n\nAn [email\naddress](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-email)\nlets Stripe notify the customer of failed payments or when completing a payment\nrequires further action, as part of the [Automatic\nCollection](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/automatic-collection) process.\n\nStore the internal customer ID of your application in the\n[metadata](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-metadata)\nattribute. Like most Stripe resources, the Customer resource includes a\n[Metadata](https://docs.stripe.com/api/metadata) object hash to flexibly store\ncontextual key-value information. To aid in auditing and support, store your\ninternal customer ID as a key-value pair on the Customer resource. This allows\nyou to search for the customer using your internal reference ID. Conversely, we\nrecommend storing Stripe customer IDs against the internal customer model of\nyour application.\n\n#### Billing and shipping addresses\n\nUse the address properties to set an\n[address](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-address)\nfor billing (invoicing, credit notes, and so on), and a\n[shipping](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-shipping)\naddress (for physical goods).\n\nWhile a shipping address is most relevant to businesses delivering physical\ngoods, a billing address is useful because it displays on invoices, credit\nnotes, and receipts—a common requirement for tax compliance.\n\n#### Email and PDF language localization\n\nLocalize Stripe-generated emails and PDFs by setting the `preferred_locales`\nproperty. This property accepts an ordered list of preferred languages, sorted\nby preference. These preferred locale values are based on\n[RFC-4646](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4646). Examples include “en” for\n, or “fr-CA” for Canadian French. See the [Customizing\ninvoices](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/customize#customer-language) page\nfor more information.\n\n#### Per-customer invoice settings\n\nFor further details on customizing invoice contents on a per-customer basis, see\nthe [Customizing invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/customize) page. It\nexplains [custom\nfields](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/customize#custom-fields), [invoice\nfooter](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/customize#footer-field) content, and\nhow to [customize the invoice\nnumber](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/customize#invoice-numbering-schemes).\n\n### Payment\n\nAll payments are collected from [payment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments)\ndetails associated with a customer, and a customer can have multiple ways to\nmake a payment, including:\n\n- [Payment Methods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods)\n- [Customer Credit\nBalance](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer#customer-balance)\n\nCustomers are\n[single-currency](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer#currency), meaning\nafter you’ve assigned a currency, invoiced the customer, or [set a customer\ncredit balance](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer#customer-balance), you\ncan’t change the currency. This locked state is visible in the Dashboard in a\ndisabled **Currency** dropdown.\n\nIf you need to bill a single entity with multiple currencies, create a new\ncustomer for each currency.\n\n### Invoicing\n\nAll invoicing-related resources are associated with the customer being billed.\nThese resources include:\n\n- [Pending invoice\nitems](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/subscription#adding-draft-invoice-items)\n- [Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview)\n- [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/overview)\n- [Receipts](https://docs.stripe.com/receipts)\n- [Invoice\nsettings](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/create#create_customer-invoice_settings)\n\n### Tax info\n\nTo meet tax jurisdiction requirements, you might need to include customer tax ID\nnumbers and other information on invoices. It’s ultimately your responsibility\nto make sure your customer’s invoices contain the correct information. This\nincludes [tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/tax-ids), [tax\nexemption\nstatus](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/create#create_customer-tax_exempt),\nand [addresses](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer#addresses).\n\nTax IDs provide a way to store and render one or more tax ID numbers on\ninvoices. Tax exemption status indicates whether the entity is taxable. By\ndefault, a customer’s `tax_exempt` status is set to `none`, meaning it’s a\ntaxable billing entity. However, you can flag a customer as being responsible\nfor paying the tax on an invoice by setting the `tax_exempt` property to\n`reverse`, or flag them as being tax exempt by setting the status to `exempt`.\nYou can read more about using `tax_exempt` and `reverse` on the [Tax\nRates](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/taxes/tax-rates#tax-exempt-and-reverse-charge)\npage.\n\n## Common tasks\n\nThis section explains some of the common tasks you might perform with the\nCustomer resource.\n\n### Create a subscription\n\nBefore you can create a new subscription, you need to create a customer for\nbilling purposes.\n\n- [Create the customer](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer#create).\n- Define your\n[product](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/manage-prices#create-product)\ncatalog and\n[prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/manage-prices#create-price).\n- [Create a\nsubscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview) using the\ncustomer created in step one and a price (or multiple prices) from step two.\n\nYou can continue to update the customer’s details after you create the\nsubscription until an invoice is [finalized](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing).\nAny changes apply to the next billing cycle, when a new invoice is generated\nusing the latest state of the customer when rendering PDFs, emails, and the\nhosted invoice page. Read the [How subscriptions\nwork](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview) page for more\ndetailed information.\n\n### Send a one-off (manual) invoice to a customer\n\nUnlike subscription invoices, you manually issue one-off invoices and they don’t\nfollow an automated schedule. This makes them useful for billing one-off orders\nor work, such as setup and installation fees, consultancy fees, or single orders\nfor physical goods.\n\n- [Create the customer](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer#create).\n- [Create a new draft\ninvoice](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/dashboard#create-invoice) by adding\ninvoice line items with a description, quantity, unit price, and tax rate.\n- [Set the invoice payment\nmethod](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/dashboard#create-invoice). You can\ncollect payment for an invoice either by automatically charging the payment\nmethod on file, or by emailing the invoice to the customer.\n- Finalize the invoice.\n\nSee the [one-off invoices\ndocumentation](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/dashboard#create-invoice) for\nfull details on how to create and collect payment for one-off invoices.\n\n### Store a customer credit balance\n\nThe [customer credit balance](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance)\nfeature allows you to assign credit and debit adjustments to a specific\ncustomer. The resulting balance is applied to future invoices for that customer.\n\n### Add and validate tax ID numbers\n\nDisplaying a customer’s tax ID on invoice documents is a common requirement.\nWith Stripe, you can add one or multiple [tax\nIDs](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/tax-ids) to a customer. A\ncustomer’s tax IDs are displayed in the header of invoice and credit note PDFs.\nSee the [Tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/tax-ids) page for\nmore details.\n\n### Add a coupon to a customer\n\nA [coupon](https://docs.stripe.com/api/coupons) contains information about a\npercent-off or amount-off discount. Stripe Billing allows you to associate a\ncoupon with a customer, resulting in a discount for all invoices billed.\n\nCreating an invoice—either manually or when generated by a subscription—uses the\ncoupon by applying a corresponding discount to the invoice amount due,\nsubtracted from the pre-tax amount. You can view this information in the invoice\nfooter summary table.\n\n### Set the currency for a customer\n\nThe `currency` property is a three-letter [ISO code for the\ncurrency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies) that you charge the customer in\nfor recurring billing purposes. You can set the currency in the Dashboard by\nnavigating to the **Customers** > **Details** page and clicking **Update\ndetails**. After you set the currency, you can’t change it. Creating an invoice\nor credit balance for the customer also permanently sets the customer’s\ncurrency.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers)\n- [subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating)\n- [invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n- [Customers page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/customers)\n- [Affiliate and referral Stripe\nApps](https://marketplace.stripe.com/categories/affiliate_and_referrals)\n- [email\naddress](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-email)\n- [Automatic Collection](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/automatic-collection)\n-\n[metadata](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-metadata)\n- [Metadata](https://docs.stripe.com/api/metadata)\n-\n[address](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-address)\n-\n[shipping](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-shipping)\n- [RFC-4646](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4646)\n- [Customizing\ninvoices](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/customize#customer-language)\n- [Customizing invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/customize)\n- [custom fields](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/customize#custom-fields)\n- [invoice footer](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/customize#footer-field)\n- [customize the invoice\nnumber](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/customize#invoice-numbering-schemes)\n- [payment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments)\n- [Payment Methods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods)\n- [Pending invoice\nitems](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/subscription#adding-draft-invoice-items)\n- [Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview)\n- [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/overview)\n- [Receipts](https://docs.stripe.com/receipts)\n- [Invoice\nsettings](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/create#create_customer-invoice_settings)\n- [tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/tax-ids)\n- [tax exemption\nstatus](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/create#create_customer-tax_exempt)\n- [Tax\nRates](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/taxes/tax-rates#tax-exempt-and-reverse-charge)\n-\n[product](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/manage-prices#create-product)\n- [prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/manage-prices#create-price)\n- [finalized](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing)\n- [Create a new draft\ninvoice](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/dashboard#create-invoice)\n- [customer credit balance](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance)\n- [coupon](https://docs.stripe.com/api/coupons)\n- [ISO code for the currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies)",
