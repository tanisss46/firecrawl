  "content": "# Formats requirements for key persons associated with accountsBreaking changes\n\n## What’s new\n\nThe `requirements` hash on the `Account` and `Capability` objects, and the\n`verification_fields` hash on the `Country Spec` object have newly formatted\nstrings for requirements that are related to key persons associated with an\naccount:\n\n- Fields that are required for persons with `representative`, `owner`,\n`director`, and `executive` roles will be prefixed with `representative`,\n`owners`, `directors`, and `executives`, respectively. Person requirements are\npreviewed as follows:- When the representative’s phone number is required, it\nappears as `representative.phone` instead of `relationship.representative`.\n- When an owner’s full name is required, it appears as `owners.first_name` and\n`owners.last_name` instead of `relationship.owner`.\n- When an executive’s ID number is required, it appears as\n`executives.id_number` instead of `relationship.executive`.\n- When a director’s date of birth is required, it appears as\n`directors.dob.day`, `directors.dob.month`, and `directors.dob.year` instead of\n`relationship.director`.\n- The boolean values that indicate the associated owners, executives, or\ndirectors now appear as `company.owners_provided`,\n`company.executives_provided`, or `company.directors_provided` instead of\n`relationship.owner`, `relationship.executive`, or `relationship.director`,\nrespectively.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe new formatting of the `requirements` and `verification_fields` hashes\ncreates a more intuitive naming convention, making it easier for you to identify\nand address the specific information needed for each person role.\n\n## Upgrade\n\n- [View your current API\nversion](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#view-your-api-version-and-the-latest-available-upgrade-in-workbench)\nin Workbench.\n- If you use an SDK, upgrade to the corresponding SDK version for this API\nversion.- If you don’t use an SDK, update your [API\nrequests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/versioning) to include `Stripe-Version:\n2020-08-27`\n- Upgrade the API version used for [webhook\nendpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks/versioning).\n- [Test your integration](https://docs.stripe.com/testing) against the new\nversion.\n- If you use Connect, [test your Connect\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/testing).\n- In Workbench, [perform the\nupgrade](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#perform-the-upgrade).
