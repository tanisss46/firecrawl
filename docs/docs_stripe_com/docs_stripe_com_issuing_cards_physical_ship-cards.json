There is a maximum of 2,000 cards per box. The\nrecipient of a bulk issuance must meet all applicable PCI certification\nrequirements. For more details, see [Bulk\nissuance](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/cards/physical/bulk-issuance).\n\n## Select service type\n\nStripe offers a variety of shipping services with different cost points,\nshipping speeds, and tracking capabilities.\n\n- Cards created are batched and sent to our printer for fulfillment at 6 am\n(UTC) the next day.\n- Card orders have tracking numbers where indicated. These are available in the\nDashboard 24 hours after card creation.\n- You can ship card orders to any [non-restricted\ncountry](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/cards/physical/ship-cards#shipping-country-restrictions).\n- After your card order ships, we deduct associated card fees directly from your\nStripe balance. You can see all of your account’s card fees in the\n[Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/balance/overview).\nUnited StatesEurope (UK merchants)Europe (EU merchants)\nThe following shipping options and pricing apply to shipments originating from\nthe US:\n\n- Use the shipping service parameter to set the delivery service: standard,\nexpress, or priority.\n- Use the shipping type parameter to set your shipment packaging: individual or\nbulk.\n- Use the `require_signature` shipping parameter to set the signature\npreference. Not all shipping methods support signatures on delivery.\n- Use the `shipping phone_number` to specify a phone number our courier partners\ncan use to contact the shipping recipient in the event of a card delivery issue.\nFor individual shipments to the EU or UK, if a phone number isn’t provided, we\nprovide the carrier with the phone number of the cardholder.\n\nYou can only send shipments without tracking numbers to addresses in the US or\nCanada.\n\nDestinationServiceEstimated arrival timeTrackingIndividual costBulk\ncostSignature on delivery1DomesticStandard (USPS)5-8 business days0.632\nUSDExpress4-5 business days13 USD27 USD+3Priority2-3 business days27 USD45\nUSD+3InternationalStandard (Canada only)8-12 business days1.503 USDExpress4-9\nbusiness days30 USD50 USD+4Priority3-6 business days40 USD60 USD+4\n1No signature is the default setting.

We also offer address validation features to avoid unsuccessful\ndelivery attempts.\n\n- **Business name inclusion**: Include the business name as part of address line\n1 or line 2 when delivering to business addresses, especially when multiple\nbusinesses share a building.\n- **Apartment numbers**: Always provide apartment numbers when applicable for\nresidential addresses.\n- **Consignee phone number**: When placing Express and Priority card orders,\ninclude a local phone number. In the event of delivery issues, the courier\ncontacts you through this number.\n- **Shipping to an APO, FPO, or PO Box**: When sending shipments to an army post\noffice (APO), fleet post office (FPO), or PO Box, shipping must be through USPS.\n- **EORI numbers for UK and EU shipments**: To expedite customs when shipping to\nthe UK or European Union, provide an Economic Operators Registration and\nIdentification (EORI) reference number. The format is typically a two-letter\ncountry code followed by 12-15 numbers (for example, GB123456789123456). For\nbulk issuance, the EORI reference number is mandatory. For more information, see\nthe [shipping.customs.eori_number\nfield](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/object#issuing_card_object-shipping-customs-eori_number).\n- **Canadian postal codes**: Don’t include a space. For example, enter M5V 3L9\nas M5V3L9.\n- **Validate the address**: Use the [address validation\nAPI](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/cards/physical/address-validation) to make\nsure your shipping address is deliverable.\n\n## Shipping country restrictions\n\nYou can ship a card to any country except for the following:\n\n- Afghanistan\n- Albania\n- Algeria\n- Angola\n- Bangladesh\n- Barbados\n- Belarus\n- Belize\n- Benin\n- Bolivia\n- Brazil\n- Burkina Faso\n- Burundi\n- Cambodia\n- Cameroon\n- Cape Verde\n- Cayman Islands\n- Central African Republic\n- Chad\n- China\n- Colombia\n- Comoros\n- Congo, Dem.
