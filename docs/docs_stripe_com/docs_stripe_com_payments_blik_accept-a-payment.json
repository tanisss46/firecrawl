We\nrecommend that you configure your payment methods from the Stripe Dashboard\nusing the instructions in [Accept a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web&ui=stripe-hosted).\n\nIf you want to continue manually configuring the payment methods you present to\nyour customers with Checkout, use this guide. Otherwise, update your integration\nto [configure payment methods in the\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/dashboard-payment-methods).\n\nBLIK is a [single use](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#usage)\npayment method that requires customers to\n[authenticate](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#customer-actions)\ntheir payments. When customers want to pay online using BLIK, they request a\nsix-digit code from their banking application and enter it into the payment\ncollection form.\n\nThe bank sends a push notification to your customer’s mobile phone asking to\nauthorize the payment inside their banking application. The BLIK code is valid\nfor 2 minutes; customers have 60 seconds to authorize the payment after starting\na payment. After 60 seconds, it times out and they must request a new BLIK code.\nCustomers typically approve BLIK payments in less than 10 seconds.\n\n[Determine\ncompatibility](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/blik/accept-a-payment#compatibility)\nA Checkout Session must satisfy all of the following conditions to support BLIK\npayments:\n\n- [Prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices) for all line items must be\nexpressed in Złoty (currency code `pln`).\n[Accept a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/blik/accept-a-payment#accept-a-payment)\n#### Note\n\nThis guide builds on the foundational [accept a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?ui=stripe-hosted)\nCheckout integration.\n\nUse this guide to learn how to enable BLIK—it shows the differences between\naccepting a card payment and using BLIK.\n\n### Enable BLIK as a payment method\n\nWhen creating a new [Checkout\nSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions), you need to:\n\n- Add `blik` to the list of `payment_method_types`.\n- Make sure all your `line_items` use the `pln` currency.\n\n```\nStripe::Checkout::Session.create({\n mode: 'payment',\n payment_method_types: ['card'],\n payment_method_types: ['card', 'blik'],\n line_items: [{\n price_data: {\n currency: 'usd',\n # To accept `blik`, all line items must have currency: pln\n currency: 'pln',\n product_data: {\n name: 'T-shirt',\n },\n unit_amount: 2000,\n },\n quantity: 1,\n }],\n success_url: 'https://example.com/success',\n cancel_url: 'https://example.com/cancel',\n})\n```\n\n### What customers see\n\nInside their Banking app, customers see four lines related to each BLIK\ntransaction:\n\n- If you provided a value for `description` when creating the PaymentIntent, the\nfirst two lines display it (max 70 characters).\n- If you provided a value for `statement_descriptor` (typically, an order ID),\nline 3 displays it (max 22 characters).\n- The fourth line automatically populates with the URL of your website.\n\n### Fulfill your orders\n\nAfter accepting a payment, learn how to [fulfill\norders](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/fulfillment).\n\n[Test your\nintegration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/blik/accept-a-payment#test-integration)\nWhen testing your Checkout integration, select BLIK as the payment method and\nclick the **Pay** button.\n\nUse a [sandbox](https://docs.stripe.com/sandboxes) to test a successful payment\nby entering any 6-digit code (such as `123456`) in the payment form.\n\n[Handle refunds and\ndisputes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/blik/accept-a-payment#refunds-and-disputes)\nThe refund period for BLIK is up to 13 months after the original payment.\n\n[Customers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers) can dispute a payment through\ntheir bank up to 13 months after the original payment and there’s no appeal\nprocess.\n\nLearn more about [BLIK\ndisputes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/blik#disputed-payments).\n\n[OptionalSimulate failures in a\nsandbox](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/blik/accept-a-payment#simulate-failures)\n## See also\n\n- [More about BLIK](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/blik)\n- [Checkout fulfillment](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/fulfillment)\n- [Customizing\nCheckout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/customization)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Accept a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web&ui=stripe-hosted)\n- [configure payment methods in the\nDashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/dashboard-payment-methods)\n- [single use](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#usage)\n-\n[authenticate](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#customer-actions)\n- [Prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices)\n- [accept a\npayment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?ui=stripe-hosted)\n- [Checkout Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions)\n- [https://example.com/success](https://example.com/success)\n- [https://example.com/cancel](https://example.com/cancel)\n- [fulfill orders](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/fulfillment)\n- [sandbox](https://docs.stripe.com/sandboxes)\n- [Customers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers)\n- [BLIK disputes](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/blik#disputed-payments)\n- [More about BLIK](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/blik)\n- [Customizing\nCheckout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/customization)",
