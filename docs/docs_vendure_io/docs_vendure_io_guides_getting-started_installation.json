(Odd-numbered versions should still work but are not officially supported.)\n\n### Optional [‚Äã](https://docs.vendure.io/guides/getting-started/installation/\\#optional \"Direct link to Optional\")\n\n- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/): If you want to use the quick start with Postgres, you must have Docker Desktop installed. If you do not have Docker Desktop installed\nthen SQLite will be used for your database.\n- If you want to use an existing MySQL, MariaDB, or Postgres server as your data store, then you'll need an instance available locally. However, **if you are just testing out Vendure, we recommend the quick start flow, which handles the database for you**.\n\n## @vendure/create [‚Äã](https://docs.vendure.io/guides/getting-started/installation/\\#vendurecreate \"Direct link to @vendure/create\")\n\nThe recommended way to get started with Vendure is by using the [@vendure/create](https://github.com/vendure-ecommerce/vendure/tree/master/packages/create) tool. This is a command-line tool which will scaffold and configure your new Vendure project and install all dependencies.\n\n### Quick Start [‚Äã](https://docs.vendure.io/guides/getting-started/installation/\\#quick-start \"Direct link to Quick Start\")\n\nFirst run the following command in your terminal, replacing `my-shop` with the name of your project:\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nnpx @vendure/create my-shop\n\n```\n\nNext choose the \"Quick Start\" option. This is the fastest way to get a Vendure server up and running, and will handle\nall the configuration for you. If you have Docker Desktop installed, it will create and configure a Postgres database for you. If not, it will use SQLite.\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\n‚îå  Let's create a Vendure App ‚ú®\n‚îÇ\n‚óÜ  How should we proceed?\n‚îÇ  ‚óè Quick Start (Get up an running in a single step)\n‚îÇ  ‚óã Manual Configuration\n‚îî\n\n```\n\nAnd that's it! After a minute or two you'll have a fully-functional Vendure server running locally.\n\n### Manual Configuration [‚Äã](https://docs.vendure.io/guides/getting-started/installation/\\#manual-configuration \"Direct link to Manual Configuration\")\n\nIf you'd rather have more control over the configuration, you can choose the \"Manual Configuration\" option.\nThis will prompt you to select a database, and whether to populate the database with sample data.\n\n#### 1\\. Select a database [‚Äã](https://docs.vendure.io/guides/getting-started/installation/\\#1-select-a-database \"Direct link to 1. Select a database\")\n\nVendure supports a number of different databases. The `@vendure/create` tool will prompt you to select one.\n\n**To quickly test out Vendure, we recommend using SQLite**, which requires no external dependencies. You can always switch to a different database later by changing your configuration file.\n\n![Vendure Create step 1](https://docs.vendure.io/assets/images/create-1-2cfad0b02eebe42e325dd6ca98150cb2.webp)\n\ntip\n\nIf you select MySQL, MariaDB or Postgres, you need to make sure you:\n\n1. have the database server running and accessible\n2. have created a database for Vendure to use\n3. know the username and password for a user with access to that database\n\n#### 2\\. Populate with data [‚Äã](https://docs.vendure.io/guides/getting-started/installation/\\#2-populate-with-data \"Direct link to 2. Populate with data\")\n\nThe final prompt will ask whether to populate your new Vendure server with some sample product data.\n\n**We recommend you do so**, as it will give you a good starting point for exploring the APIs which we will cover\nin the [Try the API section](https://docs.vendure.io/guides/getting-started/try-the-api/), as well as providing some data to use when\nbuilding your own storefront.\n\n![Vendure Create step 2](https://docs.vendure.io/assets/images/create-2-e8a18682ffcd8a5f3e1b8a688060b184.webp)\n\n#### 3\\. Complete setup [‚Äã](https://docs.vendure.io/guides/getting-started/installation/\\#3-complete-setup \"Direct link to 3. Complete setup\")\n\nNext, a project scaffold will be created and dependencies installed. This may take a few minutes.\n\nOnce complete, you'll see a message like this:\n\n![Vendure Create step 3](https://docs.vendure.io/assets/images/create-3-1c1d9d00545f9718d2e291b6d45f259d.webp)\n\n### Start the server [‚Äã](https://docs.vendure.io/guides/getting-started/installation/\\#start-the-server \"Direct link to Start the server\")\n\nFollow the instructions to move into the new directory created for your project, and start the server:\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\ncd my-shop\n\nnpm run dev\n\n```\n\nYou should now be able to access:\n\n- The Vendure Admin GraphQL API: [http://localhost:3000/admin-api](http://localhost:3000/admin-api)\n- The Vendure Shop GraphQL API: [http://localhost:3000/shop-api](http://localhost:3000/shop-api)\n- The Vendure Admin UI: [http://localhost:3000/admin](http://localhost:3000/admin)\n\nCongratulations! ü•≥ You now have a fully-functional Vendure server running locally.\n\nNow you can explore Vendure by following our [Try the API guide](https://docs.vendure.io/guides/getting-started/try-the-api/) to learn how to interact with the server.\n\nIf you are new to GraphQL, you should also check out our [Introducing GraphQL guide](https://docs.vendure.io/guides/getting-started/graphql-intro/).\n\ntip\n\nOpen the Admin UI at [http://localhost:3000/admin](http://localhost:3000/admin) in your browser and log in with the superadmin credentials you specified, which default to:\n\n- **username**: superadmin\n- **password**: superadmin\n\nVendure CLI\n\nUse `npx vendure add` to start adding plugins & custom functionality to your Vendure server.\n\nLearn more about the [Vendure CLI](https://docs.vendure.io/guides/developer-guide/cli/)\n\n### Troubleshooting [‚Äã](https://docs.vendure.io/guides/getting-started/installation/\\#troubleshooting \"Direct link to Troubleshooting\")\n\n- If you encounter any issues during installation, you can get a more detailed output by setting the log level to `verbose`:\n\n\n\n\n```codeBlockLines_e6Vv\nnpx @vendure/create my-shop --log-level verbose\n\n```\n\n- The [supported TypeScript version](https://github.com/vendure-ecommerce/vendure/blob/master/packages/create/src/constants.ts#L7) is set upon installation. Upgrading to a newer version of TypeScript might result in compilation errors because\nTypeScript sometimes introduces stricter checks in newer versions.\n- If you want to use **Yarn**, from Vendure v2.2.0+, you'll need to use **Yarn 2** (Berry) or above.\n\n## Set up a storefront [‚Äã](https://docs.vendure.io/guides/getting-started/installation/\\#set-up-a-storefront \"Direct link to Set up a storefront\")\n\nOnce you have a Vendure server running, you can set up a storefront to interact with it!\n\nWe have a number of storefront starter kits available for you to use - head over to the [Storefront Starters](https://docs.vendure.io/guides/storefront/storefront-starters/)\npage to learn more.\n\n![Remix storefront](https://docs.vendure.io/assets/images/remix-storefront-8ed426b1b737249bf2676945ab9cca94.webp)\n\n- [Requirements](https://docs.vendure.io/guides/getting-started/installation/#requirements)\n  - [Optional](https://docs.vendure.io/guides/getting-started/installation/#optional)\n- [@vendure/create](https://docs.vendure.io/guides/getting-started/installation/#vendurecreate)\n  - [Quick Start](https://docs.vendure.io/guides/getting-started/installation/#quick-start)\n  - [Manual Configuration](https://docs.vendure.io/guides/getting-started/installation/#manual-configuration)\n  - [Start the server](https://docs.vendure.io/guides/getting-started/installation/#start-the-server)\n  - [Troubleshooting](https://docs.vendure.io/guides/getting-started/installation/#troubleshooting)\n- [Set up a storefront](https://docs.vendure.io/guides/getting-started/installation/#set-up-a-storefront)",
